Welcome to wordseg's documentation!
===================================

In this project, we seek to study a set of algorithms for word
segmentation from phonological-like text transcriptions.

**Word segmentation**

   Takes a phonological-like text transcript and returns one or
   several versions of the same corpus, with automatically-determined
   word boundaries, as well as lists of the most frequent words, and
   all this based on a selection of algorithms (chosen by
   user).
