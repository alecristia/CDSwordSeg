yeah 
well because that really got her she was the most
not like this 
she has got  
 actually I was gonna ask you where you got them she
 but these are more fun to knock down 
yeah on the changing table I do put a diaper over her face and
I have never done it with blocks before 
I have never really been right in front of her and had blocks
usually you know if we are in this situation we are
yeah like combing the dog and stuff 
yeah 
we have got a dog with a brush and yeah 
and she combs her own hair 
Loren has a couple of brushes and yeah 
she has she has combed our dog before 
oh I mean watched me and then you know had it in her hand but
oh yeah 
she has got a telephone 
yeah and  ours has a dial and I make it ring and she picks it
 Hello 
and we usually pretend it is Daddy 
we call him 
yeah You want this 
no  That picture no no she might relate better to baby 
a lot of times I call things baby or  We have a
we call him baby bunny mommy bunny sometimes too but I
no and I do not think  these would probably be
but since these were side by side did not hurt to
what are you doing 
she likes to put things the putting in and taking out we
she likes to put them away 
her books right now 
 I do not know why she did not really respond to 
or just the plain blocks like that but it's characters doing
she is really into books 
she will bring books wherever you are in the house 
she will go into her room and bring books out and she backs up to
I realize that  the whole first half I was really directing
I think that is that happens a lot at home too 
I did not think she was saying very much but 
 so far yeah 
yeah it was ants I think the second time 
an ant 
oh yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
because we've seen butterflies out in the yard we call that
well she was saying duck and then she started consistently
I didn't care 
no because not now not at this point 
I think a little bit later on I mean if if it had
I don't think she knows the difference 
well she was saying boy she said boy at one point in this
 
  she doesn't respond 
oh well I never even thought of naming that 
she knows that so well but we started with well the face
oh the tongue and the teeth and the mouth and the nose and
Alice where's your tongue 
where's  stick it out 
stick it right out 
go 
and socks 
they're all shoes 
they're all shoes to her 
she knows socks 
and then you sort of pointed out the other things that went with
things like drinking out of the cup 
 she doesn't use a bib so she doesn't know that word at all 
and we don't say cup she doesn't use a cup she uses either a
cereal and soup yeah 
we kiss a lot 
and we ask her for kisses a lot and she kisses her sister a
at one point 
but so the smelling the book let's see we had a couple a
well the puppy bites her 
I tell her to tell me whenever the puppy bites and then we whack
oh yeah we got some cloth covered blocks like this that we
yes yeah 
she always recognizes an apple 
well she climbs on everybody else's 
no she doesn't 
well yeah she has some 
she has a set of chairs but it's really Lauren Lauren's set
yeah I was surprised 
about a week and a half ago she started saying chair and I
yeah 
and I don't know where that came from 
well occasionally 
about a couple of weeks ago she had my keys where's Groucho 
she can say Groucho and Chico 
we've got these two cats that live in our house and she says
well a lit occasionally she does she'll reach for
that's when I noticed that she could say it 
and so I give them to her if she can say it 
she can have it 
well she she says that a lot 
yeah 
she used to say ball 
well she calls balloons balls 
and when she saw that she said ball right away 
but she said it very clearly the way she used to say it 
she has mommy see and of course all gone but that's not 
daddy bye is daddy gone 
or sister 
and she says something else that I thought is a really long
it has about three words in it 
no 
I don't 
no Yeah well it's in
yeah I like to do that I don't I don't think she knows
she knows bird she knows a rooster she knows a cow a
she's never seen butterflies either She looks at them a
she she really likes books 
she what she does mostly is look at them 
and either you can ask her to show you what the different
probably more often is sit there and point to the picture 
and have you tell her what it is 
yeah most of the time 
she usually she usually looks for what she wants 
I use them both 
a lot 
sometimes I call them bunny rabbits you know I just do use
no 
I don't think I every really thought about it 
yeah I do I guess 
I don't I never really thought about it much 
I I talk to them a lot I think probably and I usually
 on her self she knows she knows all the face parts she
yeah just playing but she does 
 she does zippers 
she likes zippers 
she's always been kinda fascinated with zippers She doesn't do
she doesn't do snaps or button or anything 
up and down which way 
oh I think she knows when she is somewhere if I say to her 
 do you want to get down 
that it means out of where she is 
down from where she is I guess she does know that 
I think she does I don't really think she knows asleep as
and there's a cat in here that was asleep and 
and she knows when yeah when your eyes are open it means
yeah  different from these but she does have some 
 she stacks them some but mostly what she does is put them in
and knock them over 
we'll  I think dragons are a pretty distinct thing 
you know I mean it's like saying it's a horse or a cow 
that's what it was 
well if it's a dragon it's a dragon you know 
I think adults probably associate bad things with dragons but
yeah 
yeah I point out a lot of things to her you know we're
I've even tried making a distinction between pigeons and other kinds
 yeah yeah she's probably not as specific Well 
yeah she does 
yeah well she just she kinda picks it up and she
 like she was talking to somebody on the phone 
a lot of times she picks up the phone and then yells for me 
yeah yeah she really likes playing peekaboo 
she likes putting things over her face and disappearing
are you brushing my hair 
are you brushing my hair 
 No 
I I think they probably understand maybe the same amount
you know she kinda sits there like she's talking to you sometimes
doesn't really do that 
she does once in a while but not like Amelia does 
no I've been reading to them a little bit but they don't pay
that's that's about all she does 
she she does that and she points or she brings me somewhere
 otherwise she doesn't I don't think have any
yeah the same way 
well she knows baby and flower 
and  ducks 
and birds 
and she's easy to pick she can pick those out pretty easily
yes probably everything but the mouse and the owl 
she tries to say boat 
we have a boat 
so she's familiar with that 
she  she does say dog I guess 
yeah she does say dog 
we have a dog also so 
no 
my mother's trying to get rid of some cats 
I don't know 
well I thought maybe she was she was saying 
 another one 
because I was saying that to her 
you know and I think that's something I probably say to her a lot
and she was doing that pointing to the same thing 
I think she has another expression for âwhat's thatâ that sounds
 what's that 
yeah she's always asking what things are 
you know in new books or anything she always wants she
well they don't have any books with paper pages and they like
and things they like to rip up things with paper pages 
she can take her clothes off 
you know she can't put her anything on 
but she she does try to put things on 
yeah 
they have new sneakers 
yeah she unties her shoes and takes them off 
no she usually doesn't want them back on again 
what do you want 
this 
yeah she's been saying flower for a long time 
 what do you want this 
it's not a baby it's a boy 
looks like a baby to you I guess 
another baby 
no 
no she doesn't 
yeah I usually point out 
words numbers that's probably why she was pointing them out 
no she doesn't 
I think that she knows that they're different than pictures 
no 
but this book rips apart 
I don't know 
I can't think of anything really 
she talks to but never sounds like she's saying anything to
they kind of babble back and forth to each other 
 I don't know 
maybe six seven words one two probably has two 
yeah says Grover and 
oh yeah she does 
well she knows real houses she doesn't really have
well well Kristin does Kristin has a doll house that she
oh I don't know it 
she says she says a lot of things like that that sound like
you know like she says something like 
 I wanna walk 
and the only thing you can really understand is the walk part 
no 
well there was nobody talking to her 
she doesn't have a toy phone anymore 
she used to but she doesn't any more 
and  she's only had contact with a real phone recently 
she listens She doesn't talk much she listens more 
that's the dog's 
well it didn't do anything I guess for her 
 no 
she just she brushes her own hair but she doesn't she
the nose it looked just like the eyes 
we have a dog 
so I think that's probably why 
ya wanna go in there 
yes 
she hangs onto the dog's tail and lets the dog pull her around the
no 
I think she was afraid of it because it moved 
yeah then it was okay 
 no 
 they have had a puppet I can't I can't remember 
recently they go outside a lot they  play with cards
you know they like things that do things 
yeah that's mostly what she's got at home 
although she now likes to look at magazines She likes to
and kids 
I did it The first time I could get it out though 
the books she has are very simple 
probably because I prefer those kind of books 
not you look at books that have a cluttering of things on the
 hum 
yeah 
no 
no she's usually very good about it I don't know maybe
she picks out cats very well 
no 
she calls them kids 
a lot of times 
do you want this in 
I just had it in and there you wanted it out 
she calls the dog her name 
yes she does 
no just her high chair 
you don't want this 
alright why don't you go put it away 
can you go do that for me 
no 
yeah 
she does 
she scribbles with them 
yeah she was saying write that was what she was saying 
no I think she understands 
yeah she knows 
I think she understands those 
just pull it out it'll come out 
she likes holes 
oh yeah she likes to stack them she likes to knock them
no 
 hum 
she knows birds fly 
she says that a lot 
birds fly 
because we feed the birds and then she watches them fly away 
you're gonna put the brush in there 
she calls all fat we have several Hupty Dumpty's and she
I noticed several other play areas
I don't know why 
it's a familiar familiar character I guess 
yeah she knows buttons and snaps 
she can't do them 
she can't do them but she knows when we do them 
she can't motor do them 
I think so 
snaps is odd except that all baby   t shirts have
no they're not 
they're two handed 
I mean you have to hold one and pull with the other 
who are you calling really 
you never call mommy 
who are ya calling 
hello 
we don't have this kind of telephone yeah they're all dials 
that's a nice one isn't it 
 hello 
hello 
ding ding ding stop playing with the phone 
put the phone back 
hello 
this makes a sound 
yeah usually we call daddy 
is daddy there 
but she uses the real phone she'll talk to him on the phone
byebye 
can ya put it back 
no 
my sister my sister lives in the same house with us 
daddy home 
no he went to work 
yeah and puppy dogs no difference same word 
I was noticing in fact thinking about this yesterday quite a
so she seems to make a distinction on the size 
 but not with dogs 
yeah 
originally 
 except that we have a book that has a dragon in it 
so she knows a dragon 
you know that's why I was a little surprised frankly 
I frankly was surprised that she didn't know that that was a dragon
this is a nice toy I've never seen this one before 
she hasn't been to a zoo yet so she doesn't understand what those
she's tried puppets at home she's a little afraid of it though 
but  she knows she knows what puppets we have
she's also watching the muppets on television my husband 
I hope 
yeah I hope she does 
because stereos and televisions oh aren't toys 
so she doesn't play with them although she does play with them
this is Nan's this is Nan's it's not Annie's and it's not a
right 
yeah a lot of things are horses words animals that she's
no but we have a yeah she's seen lots of pictures of cows 
let's get down alright 
let's get down 
you didn't even see this bunny 
what's that 
mousie it's not a mousie it's a bunny 
I'm reminded of a handicapped C P girl that I worked with for
and  she said the words that were appropriate to her
and  I think that's what happens with a kid 
that's why the mother can can  interpret what she's saying
my husband hates cats and every time he sees one he goes 
 rat 
it's obviously working but I think it's getting her a bit
obviously the books make her talk less 
yeah yeah we have lots of books she doesn't use books at
it's usually at a quieter you know when I'm trying to get
but it's hard for someone her age to sit anyway 
she doesn't under stand that concept 
 to three at least  she only skips five so number
she started the routine because I haven't been doing any
I think she really start counting because in the gym we she
they all do that 
I don't think so 
I don't think so 
they just have that one routine 
well âon my lapâ I guess because we have a baby next store so
because she speaks in a high voice to a baby 
and she speaks I mean I don't remember speaking in a high
and  she goes through that whole routine with the baby thing
 and we we were really amused 
I think the word lap because the baby always sits on the mother's
I don't know 
see I don't I don't think that we teach her anything 
but you know except by what we say 
no no 
on his knees yeah 
yeah instead of Humpty Dumpty 
 Yeah she really does know 
yes by hair 
not by any sex parts although she knows there's a big difference
she uses me to do things for her usually 
it's usually Mommy do it and I have to urge her to do it so 
 she still used me 
 smaller ones 
just started to play with blocks 
she's not that 
 I initiated the bridge concept and she still doesn't do that
but won't make a bridge herself 
 she'll make a tower she knows what a bridge is like she
so she knows the concept of a bridge but she's not I don't
no I'm not done yet 
 no 
I don't like that toy 
we have we just have baby dolls 
yes 
and Michael's 
she wants to zip and unzip my pants and my belt 
 she doesn't have a lot you know she doesn't have belts 
yeah  she's trying to do shoes now 
but she  can't do them yet 
she doesn't try to untie 
yeah 
easily 
 Now has become a big word 
she gets on the phone and says 
 Daddy come home now 
 yeah well we're trying to share now because she has
she's entered that stage when everything is 
 mine 
yeah 
yes 
but she would never say it's Mike's turn 
yeah well she likes to play with me 
yeah 
yeah a lot of 
 like me 
 like Annie does 
like she wants to be like someone else is 
 if someone's bigger 
so like 
 mommy does 
again again again again 
she likes to really repeat  like songs I mean we'll sing
right 
 a very small baby like she'll help Peter my nephew's 
but no one her own size she's really not sharing very
I don't think 
yes 
yes and turns everything on and it's getting difficult 
well we try 
 Yes 
she'll put one thing back 
she likes things in their place 
if its something like a coat she always insists that I hang it up
but when it's all her toys all over the floor she's not the
well because lots of times I'll tell her that something 
for instance we've been putting in a garden 
I'll tell her that the wheelbarrow is too heavy for her 
but she insists on trying it anyway 
 proving to herself that she can't carry groceries in the house
you know I I almost mentioned it to her this morning and
so  I was surprised 
 I don't know what she thinks some of them are 
I I mean most of them are neuter 
except the obvious little girl dolls 
well the Humpty Dumpty's I think she considers as boys 
what's the date today 
she'll be twenty months tomorrow 
that big sound after the elephant is my husband makes a huge sound
I was afraid to hold her off because we're going away on Friday 
it's always hello  the person's name and then oftentimes she
I mean she gets a response 
no on the fake 
or on the real one when there's no one on the other end 
call 
yeah her father  and then Mark and Christopher who
always 
the dragon 
oh 
 She puts everything up in  do You mean in human
everything goes every place 
oh yes 
always 
she usually reads to the toys 
the toys don't usually take can't usually do anything that's
can you put everything into the box for us 
no the steam coming out of the the steam coming out of the
the kite tail 
she knows about steam because we she oftentimes will  in
but I'm not sure she's ever seen steam in a book 
because lots of times things are too hot and the stock phrase
 I'm going to separate this with my spoon to let the steam out 
is the phrase 
so she knows what steam is 
 we've seen all of them 
but she doesn't use the words for them 
she only knows fire engine and truck 
the dump truck she knows 
she's not especially interested 
 Yeah a lot of kids do but she doesn't seem to be very
cow's on the next page 
I don't know 
I'm surprised she doesn't know snowman but I guess she doesn't
I know for a fact that when my brother in law babysat for her
so I was a little surprised she didn't know what that was 
I think sometimes she has trouble it used to be she knew
now it seems like if she's seen it in real life she has a
I don't think she's ever seen a snowman a real snowman I
she's back into sitting on laps 
she's  kind of regressing I don't know what you call it 
she I think she's going through a stage although I don't
I don't know anything about stages in children yet 
but she's getting quite difficult to separate from me 
 the lunch box  her nephew got a lunch box 
and we keep telling her that when she goes to school she can have
She's quite she loved that lunch box 
she's been a couple of times to try her out 
yeah she understands them 
talked about them before I was hoping that she would talk about
also I wanted her to get used to the fact that she's not going to
because she really is attached to this Marco beyond belief 
yeah a cousin who abuses her terribly 
she understands going on a boat I think she understands fishing
well she's had someone else's fishing pole they play on the
 Play in the waves you know 
make castles in the sand all the things that children do 
 not a lot 
she builds with blocks but 
not creatively 
mostly it's 
 she doesn't make bridges she stacks 
she's not counting much these days 
although she was the last time she was here I remember She
no I don't think she asks how many usually 
oh she'll pretend sometimes to be counting if there's a bunch
and she'll always go by rote one two three four five six
but  I don't think she's connecting them 
yeah she's 
slide it through the hole 
usually 
but I was showing her as well 
she wanted to well she wanted to undress him and she zipped
 yes 
they have some names 
some of them have names 
one is dolly 
that's the dolls' name Dolly I figured  and one is
because it's Raggedy Ann 
she had a thumb operation 
she wanted to know if he was going to fix Peter's thumb 
now she thinks that everyone who goes to the doctor she had an
now she thinks that everyone who's going to the doctor is going to
she must think people have strange thumbs 
yeah she wasn't 
I'm surprised 
I I think she's not paying much attention today 
but I'm not going to make excuses sometimes she does and
she's not super she doesn't sit and listen to books as much
you mean my asking 
 what is that 
sure 
she went to the dentist a couple of weeks ago with us and you
it's kind of like a symbiotic relationship 
we have a book called crocodile tears which she's always enjoyed
it didn't crack her up 
but it cracked me up because it looked like looked like you
of course the turtle doesn't have any teeth 
yes  all the time 
well she's just she's into books into reading a lot 
so what do I do when I go through the books and we've read through
she's very familiar 
she will actually point 
Uh I started it out just asking her where is the bird where is
and she'll point out at them and now she will actually say and
 it's all Walt Disney characters and Walt Disney books and
so its that's basically what we've been going through and
she loves colors she knows green and blue 
you know blue 
ya know what color's yellow 
can you find me something yellow 
she can say yellow 
lalas and lolly is yellow 
red she can say but she says a weird word 
sounds something like shabby For red I'm not sure why 
yeah right I think it has something to do with strawberries 
but pink  she's really good with pink and green 
they are perfectly good she can 
yes black 
wow 
  she has some soft ones that we really don't play with
they're folded 
I think you saw them they're kind of made of cotton 
 they're really nice material 
they have Winnie the Pooh with them and Micky Mouse and Donald Duck
yes you like stacking these don't cha 
are they all there 
sure 
she can throw them they're great 
she can stack them and knock them over and they don't hurt anything
 She has the little round plastic and little square plastic
and they're really 
that's where we really got into colors because they're such
and she's starting stacking those up the little things around
and every time I walk into a room I see  another
right we have a cat and a dog so she's familiar with both 
she feeds the dog all the time 
from her chair when she's eating 
and she's getting into combing everything 
we hide her brush and  everything in the crib and a
no we call she calls Scooby âBoo Booâ now
she started calling him Booby 
yes right that's Scooby 
and Gus is Gus Obi is another cat 
she Obi's our Grandma's cat 
that's Grandma 
Pata is grandma 
 strange 
no it's probably just 
you start putting the i@l e@l on it because it begins to be an
so that's how I started doing it 
she dog 
 Puppies and dogs and she started calling them woowoo 
 It's terrible you pick up the kids' language 
no 
not at all 
she has no idea what a dragon is 
oh 
because it was a dragon 
do ya know where your nose is 
show us your nose 
show us your nose Cindy 
be smart 
she's aware of her nose and her knees her toes 
we started doing we're doing the hokey pokey at
 she says put your hand on your head put your hands on your hair
she'll she knows hair and hat and hand and ears 
yeah she knew those 
I haven't used those for a while 
I stopped doing that 
those are the things I had done a couple of months ago with
it's okay to do it with her she asked you to 
she has her own little phone and all she says is hi and bye 
when we call up someone she'll pick her phone up while we're on
hi and bye is it 
no not really 
she's talked to him on the phone actually when he's in New York 
and she well she doesn't talk to him 
she just listens and she knew it was him 
and she would say 
 Daddy Daddy 
afterwards and point at the phone and  
daddy's doing tape recordings now too and she we've got him on
 Daddy Daddy 
so that she makes all these good connections 
so I'm sure she knew it was his voice on the phone and she's
she doesn't say anything to him except bye maybe at the end of it
cats and dogs and mice 
ducks 
birds 
elephants 
Dumbo Oh yes 
we have a little selection these little plastic pigs and cows
 she can say Moo for cow I have to take her to Drummond
for that sort of thing 
peter Magic because he has all these little magic things on him
so I called him Peter 
 she could untie the laces 
I she doesn't take any you know interest in untying
yeah she doesn't do that she has a zipper on a little case 
she really has no desire to open it 
no either one 
yeah 
she does 
she knows the difference between little boys and little girls 
because she starts saying baby about everybody 
I there were the kids who were at the age where their mommys
 little boy little girl 
yes 
we have the tulips growing outside and she helped me pick one the
the daffodils just came out and the roses are starting to grow 
it's the bush she can't touch 
so luckily we live around those things 
and rose and tulip it's a yeah I think I think she
I I really do 
it's a pretty bright green phone 
lion in the cage in the Dumbo book but it's nothing that 
she uses flair pens and  
she can draw circles now 
it's really great I can't believe it 
she's drawing all over everything though 
 no I had I gave her crayons but she eats them so
and it works out much better 
yeah with the flairs and with the ink pens and pencils she'll
I haven't given her the crayons lately maybe I should try
but she loves to draw 
she knows all her colors 
yes 
just just like we did before but now instead of having to
it's great 
seems to come through 
pink 
and green were the very first colors and orange seemed to come
red was the hardest 
but red she can say now 
I think she just had difficulty saying it 
and white didn't seem to be that hard to understand and black
nothing is black when you ask for colors usually 
she zips bags up and down she has her little bags 
just a sec I'll give it to ya 
there ya go grapes 
now you can go play with the books okay 
go look through those books 
they're new 
we haven't seen those books before 
we have a ton of books at home and she can tell me exactly
hand hand 
that's her favorite 
no no none of these 
yeah that book especially 
we have a doctor Seuss's abc book and they they ya just
this it's a little over the heads I think 
 well words like vanilla ice cream I'm I'm not sure
I thought that was a good word because it's not in our book 
our book has something like jelly jars and jam and she's
except she knows what jelly is 
but  
yeah and she's pretty good about  yelling for it 
bib 
bib 
gimme that bib 
I try to not have her wear it lately because she's been eating
yeah she does she has a little blue cup 
and ya drink you juice out of it too 
she feeds the dog all the time 
everything she's not supposed to 
her meal 
she'll feed the dog she'll pick out all the good stuff
here Scoob  have some good stuff 
 she plays with mirrors all the time 
just I always did when I was a little kid and I remember my
besides herself 
oh yeah well first of all when you look in a mirror
 there's Cindy 
or 
 look at Cindy 
so she could see how dirty her face was or wasn't so I could wash
and she would be more pleased if it were dirty to let me wash 
so that's worked out very well 
we have strawberries in our garden 
she's very aware of those because they're growing the
go stack your blocks 
pick all the blocks up 
well shoes yes 
she tries to put them on and she tries to put her clothes on 
but she helps me when  when I'm undressing her like
she's always very good when you dress her 
 left leg 
yeah well her daddy's talked to her 
he's been back and forth in New York with his band so he calls
and she talks to him it's really cute 
she'll tell him what she's done in two or three words like if
she went to the ocean she told him ocean 
it so funny 
what'd you see at the ocean 
I mean at the aquarium 
fish 
did you see shark 
big shark 
really neat 
yeah she did appreciate them as fish 
she knew they were fish and we saw the movie which was
and that kinda gives you an even better perspective because
and the sharks were there 
since they redid it I hadn't been there for a long time you can
you saw the sharks didn't ya 
she remembered when it snowed and she had a snowman book I
we'd always go out and make a point of it when it did 
no she's just those are things that she's had experience
she doesn't really play with my keys very much 
she knows what they are I don't think she really cares that
balls yes 
balls are great 
I have yarn but it's in balls so that's why I said
 balls of yarn 
when I talk to her about it 
she always points to it she knows kittens play with it she knows
she loves eggs 
don't cha 
loves ducks 
 favorite animals dog 
would you like an apple

okay  sure 
she has tons of books 
Walt Disney books every story and she just loves to read all
we have the cat in the hat she'll repeat in the cat in the hat all
 I don't remember 
she's incredible 
she has an incredible memory 
 well the cat in the hat the rhyming books she
mom came in 
 would you please go now 
was one then she liked that really well and then it just got
she loves Mickey mouse books happy birthday book that's the
September ninth 
she was two a couple of weeks ago 
no not really 
she's very aware 
I just have we just she just wants to learn 
so much it's just so why say the same thing 
she picks up some things on her own some times she knows well
they keys she says 
 mommy's keys 
or 
 daddy's keys 
and basically mine open the house and daddy's drive the car
you know he has more on his key chain 
but she makes some up where they go but she's got a bit
oh 
she's getting older 
no I the cats are growing up the kitten that grandma had
 he was kitty 
I think kitty was easier to say for her as a beginner but i@l e@l
no she says 
 pancake 
I don't think she thought it was a cake 
it started with an h@l in the book 
there's another different word for the same thing 
no I try not to show her those things 
we try not to 
lollipops are about the only thing she's gotten into and maybe
but no I try to steer clear of those aisles 
yeah that's true yeah 
yes they are she has her toys she has her books and she
I probably said that about some certain things around that she
but it is not a toy 
no 
she was interested on on the mass pike this morning 
about the buses and trucks going by but not the trucks 
we don't have any trucks 
I don't have  the little cars she's played with but
yes she does 
one that's one month younger than her and we're in a play
oh yeah he's got boy's toys 
yes yes 
one or whatever she'll count to see if it's one two she's
 I think it has a lot to do with Sesame street and Ernie and
they have the counting 
the froggie too 
a baseball 
she thought it had a baseball in his hand Richard plays with
she's never worn one and she's always had so much hair I
 she never had a cap 
she's been into colors a lot a long time she walks around 
 I can't imagine what it will be like pumpkins 
 
we have a rocking chair and a regular chair at home with
from the garden 
the garden's been great 
 not really because basically all that's zinnias or marigolds
I'm not sure I tell her what they are the roses only came out
I'll pick this flower 
well she used to wear one they're around they're still in
 and she's pretty neat now with eating so it's not that
yes 
very familiar 
I don't drink it 
no we don't have it around 
 she's used to tea you know not coffee 
oh yes 
it's in the car right now 
do ya wanna sit down on that chair 
you can sit down on that chair if you like 
she doesn't eat out of glass bowls the big bowls like that 
she's not sure what a knife is but I don't let her have one so
zips the bag 
 her bag 
she zips that up and down  she unties real well 
she's just beginning to put shoes on her self like her tennis shoes
and buckling 
it's mostly like this 
just pullover very let's see the blue jeans now have
the pants 
she hasn't really tried 
yeah 
she's doesn't really care you know one way or the other
she doesn't make any it not really 
she doesn't like to take anything off 
she's just happy with what she's wearing 
my little nudist 
she can zip things up but not down 
that's because when you zip down when you zip these pants down
well she's not really sure that's what she should do first 
think what I've noticed with the bag she's she's been really
but not zipping it back up 
no and we have some beautiful wooden blocks too that she just
whereas the little boy Richard came over to the house and he
and she just has no desire to build 
just from reading the books 
she started doing that 
I with the drawing like just draw the c@l and the c@l is
no she ended up finding out b@l for boo boo herself the dog's
but she picked up the b@l for boo boo herself and c@l for Cindy
it's a weird letter 
and cookie starts with c@l 
yeah he's your friend 
she tries 
she has the brush usually the opposite way 
she has the hard part down on her head and the bristles
but she tries 
and sometimes she gets the hair 
for her to do it to someone else 
I don't know she's 
yeah she can get the brush the right way but it's hard for her
but she's tried dogs and dolls well the dog has such
and Gus is so soft it's not like he has anything to comb either 
yes 
she she had a pretend tea party and she fed all of her little
she was making all the little  out of
oh we had gotten some clay recently she's been playing with
she'll say it and it'll be sort of a little weird however I
then when she can say it again she usually cleans it up a little
sometimes sometimes she doesn't 
depends on what time she feels 
but she often will 
 books 
she's got several books not like this 
this is one of the cutest books I've ever seen it's a an
it's cute 
 she's got one of these she likes to put things  
 I don't I really don't know if she's that familiar
 there is a dog where she sometimes goes to the
one of them's kitty and the other one has another name 
 no we just started calling it that and 
yeah very small ones 
she stacks them 
throws them 
carries em around as many as she can at once 
 I thought she might know kitty but that's about the only
I don't think so 
she might know boy 
she's been exposed to ducks but I don't know how well she knows
she brings them to me and makes me go through them over and
and you know sometimes she sits 
like that by herself 
she looks at them 
she's got a Raggedy Ann and a another soft no 
yeah just sit around 
 not as much as we used to 
 just  peekaboo and you know behind 
it's just you said it was a dragon so I just thought of
yeah I know what you mean I 
 it just never occurred to me to think of you know it's a
she has a puppet 
sometimes she likes it 
she'll make that little noise like she made with the dog 
very loving to it and other times she could care less about
no and that was a new routine I'd never done that with her 
yeah she feeds herself 
yeah combs and brushes she'll brush
oh did I 
I just called it a bunny because it said bunny on it so 
I think I've always used the word bunny no rabbit 
yeah it seems like an easy thing to memorize you know one
yeah she has a number book at home 
seven bunnies 
yeah she lifts it up and goes that allo  allo
and whenever the phone rings if like sometimes her father
she never says a word but a big smile comes on her face 
she's got two toy ones 
one of them's just like this a different color and the
I really don't know 
she used to wrap this one around her neck and walk around the house
so but she does do that 
 hello hello 
  so you know so as though she had some connection
she runs to the phone 
it's a big event 
it's not when she's done playing 
it can happen any time 
with any number of things she likes to put things in
she likes to seems to like to put things in a an orderly
not every time  once in a while I tell her but she
I think she knows put 
put it away yeah 
I don't think so 
she has one at home right like it 
 Just like it 
not really 
I think the novelty's worn off 
she immediately runs to where it is 
and gets all excited 
loves to pull on the cord if I don't keep it out of reach 
and when she listens to voices  smiles 
but won't say a word 
I don't know 
she'll come well she'll run to it immediately when it rings 
no not at all She has a little rocking chair like 
I don't think so 
she didn't really respond when I yeah 
I think all of them 
she says up all the time 
when she wants up 
not as much as up 
that's her favorite word  I think she understands almost all
I don't think I've used upside down before 
oh yeah 
yeah 
she'll put things like her dirty clothes in her clothes
she can follow a lot of directions put it in there out there
I shouldn't have done that 
I won't get her a dragon 
she stacks them 
and oh she loves to throw them that's the latest thing 
smaller ones though that she throws 
 depends on her mood 
 sometimes she is but not today 
no 
yeah for at home she will 
yeah 
 she has a little book with nursery rhymes that she really
and  She seems like
read I mean you know look at the pictures 
she has about eight or ten books 
that's it 
probably not 
no not at all 
I don't maybe I do I don't know 
I did that I must  I did in the book 
and maybe I do I didn't think that I do 
yes 
well mostly little boys actually 
there's one little girl but she's a bit older 
there's not many little girls around where she is 
 I've seen her doing it She likes to touch them I just
that's the first time I ever said I didn't even know she knew
we look in the mirror together I don't know if I say 
 who's that 
maybe I do 
I don't know 
I I'm not sure 
she knows yeah in fact  I don't know if you saw it 
she she wasn't interested in the doll's shoes maybe because
she has sneakers and sandals she brings them to me I say go
yeah she unties them I have to double knot them 
all the time 
yeah she'll use a brush on her own hair and in fact if
it's one of her favorite things 
some well she has some things I call cups and others that
I think she knows cup but  she just wasn't that interested
 but it broke apart and I never got her a new one but whenever
so that's they way 
 I think so When it's lunchtime I'll say let's go 
 Let's are you ready for lunch 
she'll just drop what she's doing and run into the kitchen and
I use eat yes I do I don't think meat comes up very
I don't think that means anything to her 
she knows no I'll say I'll say 
 ya want some more chicken 
or hot dog or sandwich  food might be to entice her
yeah she says it too 
 When she wants more Yeah if she's eating 
I don't know 
I guess I said 
 night night 
and she can identify with that 
feeding it dinner and it's things that she does herself I
she thinks it's fun to do it with something else 
like some kids do it with dolls but she doesn't play with
she has lots of dolls half a dozen dolls 
nothing Nothing she just you know she just smile at
I think it's the fact that I was making the dragon move 
and it was 
no I had to be there to do it 
that's the main thing 
 yeah 
yeah 
no but she enjoys it when I play with them with her 
it's I think it's a function of me doing it 
we have cats 
yeah but she sees dogs They're around 
yes 
she feeds she feeds she loves to feed the cats 
she wants to feed them everytime she sees them 
you know it's a big event 
 I'll put food in the dish and she'll carry the dish and
so 
no 
she loves puzzles and I read a lot of books to her  
as much as you can read at that age 
 I have one called 
 Good night Moon 
that she likes 
because she's really intrigued with the moon 
why don't you play over here 
see all the fun toys 
ya wanna sit in here again 
okay 
 let me think  she has a little record player 
and  I bought her a little cup and saucer set and
that kind of thing She likes outdoor things 
riding her little tricycle and In fact that's all she wants to
the first thing in the morning 
 outside outside 
but she will if shut in her room play with toys otherwise 
or she follows me around and helps me do chores around the house
like well she'll unload the dish washer for me you know
like I don't know She seems She seems like she loses
and I'll buy her something that I'll think she'll be interested
I don't know 
she likes real things 
 like she  she likes to get into my pots and pans and
or  something unique like clothes pins she likes to help
by handing me the clothes pins  the doggie
yes she says house when she sees house 
real houses 
yeah she says house you know we'll be going along and
so she does know what a house is 
she knows all of them I think so because she even said
yeah I think so 
where's the tongue Dale 
see she said tongue 
yes 
yes 
she likes taking things in and out 
I don't know what she was doing but I have a potted plant and she
all this dirt under the rug 
but little things like that she does like 
yes 
she calls some people by name 
I think so because sometimes she'll answer with her name 
once in a great while she'll read a book by herself 
but it's very short and mostly she'll bring it to me if I'm
she'll try it depends if they're those thick pages  I
unless it's just grabbing and that kind of thing she really can't
 I think she was just kinda bored with it 
 She has that book 
I got her that book 
and when you get towards the end she sort a loses
yeah she's not into blocks very much any more 
except to throw them 
I don't know She has a lot of blocks at home but  she
she likes to throw them if anything 
so I don't know why not 
 well maybe because the cats get fed maybe she's
I guess it is from observing 
I don't really know 
never thought about that 
she never has been 
when I come here 
she has toy phones but she doesn't play with those either 
but she does talk on the real phone now and then like her
I guess it depends on her mood 
that could be 
she was all by herself just in her room talking up a storm 
of gobbledygook talk you know not  
if you can call it that 
well I want her to have a good pronunciation but I figure
I don't care if she doesn't perform perfectly at two years old 
I think it's neat that she's talking and saying things and 
 she's pretty vocal on her own I just figure I'd rather
just anything she wants to say and worry about the
you mean like adults that come and say that to her 
I guess because I have heard people come up and say 
 what's your name 
and so I'm teaching her to answer with her name and probably
she's very talkative to people She'll always say Hi and Bye bye
she's already talkative 
so I guess maybe just to say her name but seems like she
we're my husband as I are curious about that 
 she kinda picked up her letters quite spontaneously and I
but she came home from her play group counting one day 
and I thought it was primarily because of repetition she picked up
 but my husband and I are wondering if she doesn't
now today she didn't demonstrate that very well 
but we saw her playing by herself one night after he'd come
we were talking in the kitchen and she just naturally sort of
and she had some wooden spools and she had them in a semicircle
so my husband and I sort a observed her from the doorway and
and he also wondered the same thing 
we hadn't discussed it together 
and he went out and he asked her how many there were and she
he removed one and he asked her how many there were and she
 five 
whereupon we decided that really there was something
so we've you know we've encouraged her to count but I
you know other than being exposed to this book which is
I mean I hadn't sat down and taught her one two three 
and neither had he and neither had my daughter 
and I've quizzed the baby sitter and she hadn't either so 
or if if she's so fascinated she lies and counts by
with pleasure 
I mean it gives her great pleasure to to count and if
or give her an environment that will promote it 
I see 
well today obviously I was trying to get her to to to
and she substituted that at one point I think 
the counting for the colors 
I asked her how many no I asked her what color the crayons were
 mother get off my back 
yes she does 
yes she does amazing things with the flat wooden blocks 
she plays with occasionally  but  her baby sitter
and they are incredibly wonderful 
and she every night creates something with them 
and they are very interesting blocks 
they  they they go perpendicular or this way 
she does not have a toy telephone and as a result she
and she does talk to her daddy regularly 
and occasionally her friends 
my husband would not let me buy her one 
because she had a doll on her one crib machine and he felt
and I acquiesced 
I know it was still I think it's the principle of the thing
and everybody has them so really she doesn't 
if we're working together I sometimes volunteer it for
yes 
she does have a play corner 
and she doesn't run loose she's very categorical about her toys 
no 
she has a small table with a free standing chair 
oh no that's in the kitchen actually 
she does some work there 
she has a standing up  table in the  play area 
and  we cleaned it up and it's she has
with her little little people 
she wanted to be there 
oh yes she's she capable of climbing in and out of well 
and we had to dismantle it and put her in a youth bed 
she has not been containable once she wants to get out of something
or into it 
she's she'll climb into her play pen if it's set up for
and she's very capable of climbing 
she knows all the animal sounds 
I found it rather boring to go you know ask her to emote 
yes because we've been to the zoological  museum at
oh yes 
and in pictures she can identify from dress which is the boy
she goes to a play group with primarily girls except one
 he's a little boy 
to it connotes that he's always crying but her friends
but we've been talking about big boys and big girls little
I don't think she has the concept 
she has names for all her dolls but we've named them as they
all all her dolls and many of her animals I don't know
but she does understand names of people she knows she knows
both of those things I'm sorry the name I've been trying to
 my name is Gail 
when she's asked and to ask another little friend of hers if
 what is your name 
 my name's Gail 
and we've done this in the car as a kind of exercise as well as
 how old are you 
and I don't think she has gotten the 
 how old are you 
bit into her head at all 
yes 
Lexington 
I think 
she knows that we live in Lexington but I don't think she really
well she can recite if you ask her she knows all of Peter
she knows all of make way for ducklings she knows all of this 
 well the zipper she knows how to zipper herself 
well that zipper's well she doesn't get it started and
it's frustrating and the button is to her I think she's
I don't think she's ever buttoned and the shoelaces 
we fool around with laces but I haven't taught her how to tie 
she's she's interested in watching me tie her shoes 
oh yes 
unties everyone's shoes 
she's been very interested in she turned last week to her
 she has hands 
 little fingers on them 
and it looked so cute 
I remembered it and today she mentioned that he had hands 
 does he have 
what else she mentioned the digits there so 
yes because we have a rabbit at home that she a puppet
she enjoys him both ways she likes him inanimate and she
 
I noticed that when I was going through some of the play
we've been doing that with her dolls with her
she really thinks it's her thing 
it is 
but my husband comes home and his voice goes way up
 and she'll come and she's very serious about it and she
but she really believes it but then every now and then 
she's been starved for three days ever since her attack of
and yesterday was just a nightmare for her 
she kept going to the refrigerator and saying 
 well how about some pickles 
or 
 how about a donut 
and it was just killing 
it was so difficult 
and today was the first time she's had bananas and wheat
and she's just so delighted that she had crackers and chicken
and she's just  she's loved again 
so she's got she's got things that she wants to eat on her
she'd love to eat some cheese 
she's not gonna have it for a few more days 
she knows what meat is 
but apparently toast probably appeals to her right now a
she really would like it 
so she's probably 
yes 
she does 
we've been also looking in pet stores at the fish 
she really knows what it is 
I think she knows them 
I 
I don't think she would ever say something I think if she
and I don't think she knows a shoe in a book as she does a shoe on
I don't we don't have it so
and she seemed to know right away to turn to the page with
and she knew she patted the bunny which surprised me 
it's possible just because everybody has it that she's seen it
she does 
she has  a set of about fifty little blocks and while I
herself 
and that so that's something new that she 
they're not 
she has gotten this thing about shoes in the last few weeks and
and started taking them off 
how do ya like that 
 
she has been around no less than six or eight people a day for
there wasn't too much in there that looked familiar to me 
from her experience 
well I think the milk she was saying milk at lunch today 
put these way in the box 
well she knows keys but I don't know if she knows the word 
and I think a lot of those things apple that she would eat an
well she does call it she does say apple 
but I think it's generally for apple sauce 
she I think she does because when I say egg she comes
she loves eggs 
and but I 
it sounded like it 
but lately she has repeated almost every word we say so you
oh she kisses a lot 
she kisses things more than people 
she'll kiss dogs and and toys and things she's not big at
no watch Kay 
she likes watches 
Scott is well her nephew who she has just been in love with for
and she says Scott about every other word out of her mouth has
we haven't had our telephone with us while we've been away so
so I haven't played with a telephone with her for over two
yeah but this as I said before this one is different from
anyhow so I think she was just 
a dial 
no 
I don't think she would know what a cage is 
maybe a cat's cage we have a cage for our cat 
but I don't know if she's really seen it 
well she has a puppet that we've been surprised that she
she doesn't know how to work it but she likes to put her hand in
and kind of wave it around 
don't think so 
she knows a lot of them but I don't think she knows doesn't
I know she knows I know she knows nose and mouth and
yeah that's one of her best toys 
everyone's 
her own and other people's 
oh she brushes our cat much to his dismay 
very well I think 
I am surprised that she brushes her own hair pretty well 
no 
I think that when some people play with blocks with her they say
so she would say the word house but I don't think she knew what
just meant I'm gonna do blocks 
she knows what flowers are 
we have been going all summer to kind of a wild place in Maine
and my mother picked her one flower one day and since then she
and she never goes outside without handfuls of flowers 
she smells them other people smell them 
in fact she wanted to pick the flowers in the nice little
I ask her that about five times a day 
and she doesn't have an answer 
I think she does 
I think she's just playing with me she won't say it 
she knows my name's mommy and daddy's name is dada 
not really because 
she decided it's time to go home 
yes but the reason that I called you now is because we're going
 pretty about fifty fifty books with everything else 
all of her toys as compared to books she'll play with half the
no 
no 
she prefers I think just the structure of hard books rather
you have cookies down here honey 
look at all these 
I don't think so I don't think 
she doesn't 
and I don't know and she did that last time too and to my
 
she likes to smell flowers 
yes 
in her head 
yes 
she plays with our rings and watches and jewelry a lot so
she hugs things a lot and I don't know where she got that
them and oh 
I guess we must have done it 
we do so many things unconsciously that we don't find out until
she has a monkey that's a puppet 
that's why she was calling that a monkey 
because that's the only  that's right that's the only
so she thought that was  all puppets are monkey's I guess 
yeah we have a book with those in so she knows  I guess
that's about the the limit 
 she knows birdies 
 
and she says it 
usually if she's in the right mood she'll repeat whatever 
not really 
just whenever I have time 
 I found that when I want her to learn a word I say  
 can you say something 
but after she's started saying calling something by a word
then she'll say again 
no we have a cat 
no but she knows about other people's houses 
she knows where her friends live we walk down the street 
and she knows her own house she knows her grandmother's
she plays a lot with my hair brush 
she has a new little toy that she plays with all my hair things 
 go get the hair brush 
because she'd carried it away from me or 
 what is this 
and she said something that sounded like hair brush 
so I know she knows the word and I think she said it
she can  she does 
she brushes her own hair in one direction or another not 
she likes her blocks 
but they're a little smaller and more more interesting I
there's lots of them in there 
easier to build higher things with 
put one on top of the other on top of the other on top of the
yes she has she I don't know why but I allowed her
and she has one book that is like this book 
I think it's made by the same people 
and it has doors that you open 
and it has animals 
and then they go to bed 
and you open the door and see them sleeping 
and she loves that with each little door 
yes and she has been for a long time 
that's one of the ways that we keep her busy 
little things in things 
she does 
yes 
to Kay Kay 
do you know where your eyes are 
she knows her eyes and her ears 
she'll point towards we worry about her eyes says 
 eyes 
and she knows ears and mouth and nose and toes nose is her
nose 
no 
I don't think she knows either 
she said man yesterday but that's the first sex difference 
I think yeah I don't think there is much difference for
and her favorite thing is raisin Bran and she just as you can see
yeah 
no she just likes to drink 
she'll just drink water and just drink it 
she likes glasses and cups 
 juice is anything liquid 
she calls everything juice water grape juice and milk are
anything liquid is juice 
 no she has her own but it's a regular bowl 
she's gonna be two October fifth so twenty two months 
no 
but 
they're named 
 0 
well it's not conscious 
it's saying  
 Maura get the bowls for the cereal 
 we need the spoon 
 where's your napkin 
 does anybody need more juice 
no 
last night she did the most extraordinary thing 
she  found a comb  and she was combing my hair and
which I thought was extraordinary 
didn't name 
 no I was surprised 
no she knows comb 
I would say she knows comb better than brush 
because that's what she used on the kid's hair 
she wouldn't say it 
no 
you are dressed 
I'll fix it 
yeah 
 how are you I am fine 
yeah that's what she was I think 
no when she gets on a real live phone she doesn't say a word
that's Grammy 
but 
yes talks and uses words grammatically 
 give it to me Here this is yours 
I mean it's all very grammatical 
no she'll ask 
she'll say 
 Help me 
well under the circumstances I was right here 
but if she was trying to do something she would come and get me 
 help me 
 open the door 
 I wanna go outside 
 the dolly is stuck 
 whatever and she'll tell me as much as she can 
no she can 
most of her dresses have buttons in back 
so she can't get those off 
 her nightgowns that have buttons in front I have to to pin
because she'll take them off 
in the middle of the night 
 her underpants she can't get off 
they it's not that she's
or she'll go and she'll get clothes she'll put on my shoes and
no Well  Maura does I've never watched I don't
 because Mommy's name is Cassy 
and if she's Mommy she calls me Cassy 
isn't that interesting 
car keys 
well those are Mommy's keys and that's Where she sees them
normally she calls sneakers sneakers sandals sandals slippers
I I may 
I don't realize it if I'm doing it 
I mean I think what I probably do is say âLet's put on your
 let's put on your sneakers 
 let's put on your sandals 
 let's put on your boots 
just  and I don't know what I do 
not as much as I should 
 Well I'm just aware of what I did for Maura 
and less for Jeff and virtually nonexistent for this 
I think so 
she likes that one 
she always laughs when she hears about the  
 dish ran away with the spoon 
she thinks that she thinks that's funny 
I doubt I doubt it 
I don't know 
yes because the last time we went to my mother's house we did
 Where's Grammy's lake 
she said as we approached as we pulled into the driveway
 this is Grammy's house 
where's Grammy's lake 
 because she had only seen the lake once 
she won't let go of me 
oh she went swimming at Lindsey's house 
yes she is extraordinarily good in the bath tub and the little
but once she's got the life preserver on in deep water she clings
yes 
she washes her face clean 
after she has she eats if she spills anything on her dress
she takes the washcloth and washes her hands and then she
we just got a new one 
the old one was broken 
I wouldn't say so but I may be wrong 
no 
oh that's just the telephone routine 
she may not do it on the real telephone but she may do it on her
I mean if she's playing I'll say 
 call daddy and ask him what he wants for lunch 
yes that I will do 
when I see it but it doesn't happen every day 
sometimes she will 
sometimes she'll just listen 
probably she doesn't expect it to happen so and because I
no but she sees Maura's hair in the morning and she sees me do my
yes she's been taking my brush 
and brushing her hair 
brushing my hair 
 I have never seen her do it but she's taken very good care
put this away in the box 
nobody that we know has pets but she may have seen
the doggie needs his hair combed 
yeah go find his house 
I don't think so 
but she does pull the books out of the bookcase and reads them to
no she looks at the she likes reading the telephone book 
she picked up a bible one day and said 
 Jesus 
very interesting 
 sometimes she comes out with the right answer 
I don't know whether it's a lucky guess or whether she really
 what color's this 
she'll say blue green red or yellow and a lot of times 
probably not 
she wasn't concentrating on it so I would say not 
she wasn't paying I didn't think she was paying attention to
I think she was thinking 
 I don't think I would ask her what color this orange is I'd
Lena is that blue 
what color's mommy's dress 
see I'm not sure she really knows but she knows colors and when
I know 
she said 
 that's a girl 
and I would have said it's a boy 
but I noticed that the hair was curly maybe that's 
 she does it a lot faster sometimes than I do 
she seems to be right I mean I'll look 
 is that a boy or a girl 
and she'll say 
 that's a boy 
and I'll look closely and say  
 right it is a boy 
I would like to know what she I'm looking at too
I can't think 
we're going into winter and she has a jacket with a zipper 
this sweater has a zipper in the back 
so she's never I can't think of anything that she's owned
so I couldn't tell you or not up or down is easy 
she had a pretty good grasp on it but didn't know how to
 and the ice cream I put in the mugs they've had their milk in 
no 
she really knows 
she really uses it correctly 
she says  
 this is his this is Jeff's this is mine this is
she knows 
her dollies 
the other things are things nobody else would want anyway 
her slippers her nightgown her clothes her room 
she's very good about sharing 
the concept seems to be deep and she's willing 
the thing that occurred to me is the whale had blue around it
I looked again and I thought 
 maybe you could think it was clouds 
 no she knew turtle she didn't know the mouse and I
like a mouse 
oh yeah 
I said did you want to match it match it or something 
I give up 
noise is unbearable 
 she seems to know two in fact she's three because I can
 Maura has a doll house 
but she's talked a lot about a big house 
the big house 
there's my house when we drive past it 
that's my house 
 and she's been playing with the bigger Lego blocks 
lately she's been drawing on things 
everything 
including jackets coats walls floors couches and
yeah well I let her play by herself  like today she
but sometimes it's more of an interaction like when she
yeah 
she does 
yeah 
with a bigger ball it's easier for her to play  you
 let's see 
mommy wants to put diapers on you 
I think she does label things 
I think  yeah that she is learning a lot of new words
a zoo she just went to the zoo yesterday 
right 
she said tiger owl goose 
no she really did see a goose 
goose 
and she's been  
and she has seen all these the neat thing about it is she
yeah so that it sort of made it more realistic for her 
box 
no 
I noticed that myself 
 I think I thought at the time that I called it a box 
so it's probably some ambivalence on my part about her
 boxes 
I think all kids when they see a box 
oh no 
I think all kids do when they see 
oh you want that to be opened 
you know box when they get gifts they enjoy the wrappings
yeah yeah we do 
yeah 
we did when she was a lot younger  when I first realized that
the sort of use of the face to learn 
 parts of the body 
yeah she's pretty good 
well she knows chin and ears and  tummy 
things like that 
and she doesn't say arms or legs yet 
puppy 
got a puppy 
just yeah she does have a routine 
that's funny like you don't I think I'm not really aware
she goes to the phone and she'll 
she'll lift up the the receiver and she'll say 
 byebye 
byebye or hi hi 
 and she talked to her meme and pepe her grandparents on the
so I sort of prepare her for that 
we're gonna go for the weekend 
this oh the books 
 I think she just didn't want to read books right now 
she's more because books is kind of like a sitting down
the blocks 
no 
but she does play with blocks at home 
quite a bit 
yeah not mutilate it no 
yeah 
 yes she does but I think more mine 
yes she is 
she's never done a zipper before 
this is the first time she's ever done a zipper 
ever 
that I've ever seen her 
yeah she was good for the zipper 
 but because she nurses I unbutton my blouse usually
 button button 
and play with the my clothes 
more than I've seen her play with her own although she probably
yeah that's right 
no I don't think she  paid attention to that 
yeah she does 
I thought like I thought it was interesting that you know 
maybe she's not ready for that concept 
where're ya going Baba 
walk 
 a walk a walk 
marie we have to put your diapers on before we go home 
look 
what's under there 
what's that 
huh 
that's you 
yeah next time maybe we can come maybe I'll come in the
when she's getting dressed no 
no 
not getting dressed Because I don't talk to her that much 
and she's not that talkative  when she eats those kind of
she gets  crazy 
and she just sort of for about an hour she talks a lot 
yeah she is 
yeah she's I guess into doors 
now 
she learned how to open the door to our apartment and go out so I
but she always wants to go out 
many more than before 
was it six weeks ago that we were here 
so like she's second 
clothing 
 diapers  
she knows you know everything that she suits bathing
 suit suit 
ya wanna bottle okay 
ba to 
and then let's see hat she knows  it hasn't
oh yeah 
a dress 
she hardly ever wears a dress though 
 a couple of times she has she knows dress 
no 
jeans is a word that she well she has used jeans 
no not usually 
I just I have hard time getting her to sit you know to
yeah she can 
I think I think she knows that though that the same word
things she usually calls she usually calls those 
but when I say sneaks she  she says 
 sneaks 
she looked 
just like yours yeah 
a box 
I did that again I did that last time 
no she still hasn't been to a zoo to see cages 
she has  been to a zoo 
and she has seen cages once 
she has but she was sort of frightened  more than
and she associated these bars with her crib because she said he
so  I didn't feel like I wanted to confuse it any more 
so  I think that's probably why I didn't push it with the
yeah she does 
she does 
an she knows  she said that before that whole a segment
 I don't know if other kids do this but and you just
yeah we do when we have the time we try I think sometimes
yup 
she will 
this is a little different though but she did put was
this time 
I know exactly why that is 
it's because she bugs me at home when I'm in the kitchen and
that dragon doesn't come out honey 
her toys are in her room or the living room and they're not 
and if I'm doing something in the kitchen and I want to have some
 go and play with your toys 
in your room' and she'll say toys and depending on how she
 no 
but she is fascinated with the chairs 
she climbs up and down onto the kitchen chairs and highchairs all
something 
eating sitting in the chairs to eat 
yeah that's right 
yeah she has that book at home 
you know it's it's funny 
I thought that she definitely knew that Paul was Paul or 
because for a long time she's been calling them by their
and doing it quite consistently 
except today she confused them so 
that one was a boy and one was a girl 
well I think that because she's still she still calls
so in the beginning all children were boys 
and now they're either boys or girls depending on I don't
I've got something for her to eat 
now I think she is calling when she sees a girl sometimes she
it's hard I don't think she really distinguishes them 
a comb 
no I use a comb though 
and so she knows that I do and the brush although I use a
yup 
no uhuh 
but she knows what they are 
well actually I used to use eggs she does eat eggs I guess
so I use them in cooking 
 a small one that she never really plays in 
 at her grandmother's house every time we go there she
for mummie 
oh yeah 
she likes to pick anything 
if we go in the store she likes to pick leaves off bushes 
patting for her is well if she's not supposed to touch
I said not to touch the tape because we don't want to take it
 Pat it 
or something 
she said 
 Pat 
and she kissed it 
and then pat it 
so that's another constellation of of  behavior that she
and children were beginning to hit her 
the learning not to hit to be nice and that involves kissing
no she usually makes a tower 
I think she was she was clapping for herself when she made a
like that she she felt that she was successful at that 
the lining on the floor is just something that I did and I
but I was having a hard time trying to think what we could do with
I think she do I think she does 
because I'm  since I've been working I worked yesterday
and I often ask her  what she's done the day before 
and she can tell me you know pretty truthfully and
but it's not sophisticated 
it's just it's usually common activities but she's told me
the walking thing was just in general 
what does she do 
when she walks she holds hands 
with the other babies in her play group 
 
ya wanna get out of the chair Monica 
she never  actually insists that she talk
pretty  consistent with what she does with the real phone
she'll just say 
 hi hi 
no  I think she liked the ringing there are some 
 hi hi hi 
but there's no ringing associated with it and that was more
but at home she can't make that phone ring at her will 
this is very important to leave this on mummie 
I'm gonna talk to Nan for a couple of more minutes 
okay 
she wants to nurse I think I can probably talk while she nurses
do ya wanna nurse 
huh 
you have to leave that on 
don't touch that though 
don't touch 
it's not touching this 
it's just that it might be picking up her sucking 
I don't know if it would or not 
take it off 
I think that she is 
 take it oh that word that phrase she says 
 take it off 
or  she  she doesn't usually say 
 put it in 
but 
 take it out 
take it out 
I can't think of anything offhand right now 
but like her sweater something she'll wanna take it off 
all of a sudden she'll get an idea that she wants to take it off 
  put it on 
but she has a little hard time putting it on herself 
so I'm starting to help her do that 
 shoes clothing 
in general 
yeah she does but I can't think like just her toys 
actually I'm probably not very good I don't know what
I guess she's been going full time for four weeks 
at school 
and I have only been here with her  this week 
or two days 
so I actually don't have that much idea in terms of what she
she they do have a lot of educational toys there that she's
little holes 
and that she's spends an hour trying to do that 
and she's able to do it so that she is  fascinated
don't touch 
just don't touch that 
okay you're going to have to stop nursing if you touch it 
I think she does 
maybe in more of a negative sense than I'd want to 
sometimes it's my own fault because sometimes at home she will
and in the kitchen and I'll be tripping over her and say 
 Marie go play with your toys 
  in your room 
no she'll say  
 no 
and  I think she does knows what are toys an what aren't
 that's not a toy 
 we're not gonna play with that right now 
although I'm not consistent because I do let her play with
such as make up 
parts that it goes on I don't know if it's helped her  I
I think she's aware of all parts of her face in fact 
and and she has words she says 
for her face 
 cheeks ears eyes brows tongue 
gums 
tongue the tongue right 
pick out one characteristic 
 yeah 
 tongue 
tongue 
yeah there's that tongue in there huh 
let's see yes 
my husband's been feeding her in the morning oatmeal 
a cereal with some sunflower seeds and sesame seeds and raisins in
I don't know 
I don't think so 
she may have 
 but they don't look that much like houses to me 
I think that's why I chose to tell her 
that it was to just although of course she could have
okay let's go Marie
