some parents take it offensive though 0 1619
and like this past weekend this this one coach 1619 5453
I called a flagrant foul 5453 7072
on his fifth and sixth grade team 7072 9037
three weekends ago 9037 10061
flagrant p@l f@l 10061 11168
flagrant was okay this was the situation 11168 13312
there is a kid dribbling down the court and he has a wide open lay up 13312 17491
his the kid on his team was right behind him okay 17491 23290
uhhuh 23290 23802
and my instinct when I'm an official I always say âlet em goâ you know lay off them so that they don't do something stupid you know hit them in the back and hurt them 23802 30224
I always say just let âem goâ 30224 31232
           âyou can talkâ to them during the game 31232 32672
I just pull the whistle on them 32672 34042
I just yell at them 34042 34554
the official can say anything 34554 35411
no one hears it except you know the players 35411 36947
I'm like let 'em go let 'em go 36947 38483
well this kid trips over his own two feet 38483 41043
huh heh heh heh heh 41043 42067
and as he's falling he grabs onto the back of the player holding uh carrying the ball 42067 49056
and he pulls down his jersey and pulls him down 49056 51895
and I was like âwhoa all rightâ I had a decision to make 51895 55200
obviously it was it wasn't with the intent to hurt him because he tripped 55200 60237
but then again he did obstruct him from getting a wide open lay up 60237 63654
so I ju I was like âwell you knowâ I called the flagrant which is the arms crossed 63654 68083
if you want to call a flagrent with aggression with the intent to hurt you have the arms crossed then you've got to swing them down 68083 73382
like really really hard 73382 75596
 75596 76025
then you know it's like that was a really serious foul 76025 77894
and that's a technical and you can get kicked out of the game for doing something like that 77894 80966
mhm 80966 81328
I just called the simple flagrant 81328 82435
the coach went nuts he went nuts 82435 83971
so this past weekend I'm officiating this game 83971 86102
uhhuh 86102 86960
not not even close to the same situation I officiate the entire game everything went so smoothly 86960 92246
he didn't say two words to me other than you know he warned me about one of his players almost getting hurt I'm like âwhateverâ 92246 97366
you know you just you blow it off 97366 98736
you completely look through him you say thank you sir you know I'll look into that and you walk away 98736 102570
well at the end of the game he came up to me and his exact words were I don't know if I should bleep this out or anything 102570 107952
nuh 107952 108352
the exact words were he came he came up to me and said âyou mother fuckerâ 108352 118192
âyou're holding a grudge from three weeks agoâ 118192 120656
and I'm just sitting you know and I'm like âoh my godâ 120656 124769
right 124769 126222
and my first reaction was to say to him you know something very sarcastic about his mother 126222 131158
considering he brought that into effect 131158 132611
mhm 132611 132728
huh huh huh 132728 133040
but I thought this guy paid money to be in this tournament 133040 135421
and I said âsir I'm in college I can't remember three weeks agoâ and âI walked awayâ 135421 140624
     âhuh huh huh huhâ 140624 141203
that's what I said to him âand I walked awayâ 141203 144125
              âthat's funnyâ 144125 144816
and he went straight to my coach 144816 148650
and said âthis tournament's this and that and da da da da daâ 148650 152400
yadda yadda yadda 152400 153603
and my coach just laughed when he heard what I said 153603 155984
huh huh âhuh huhâ 155984 157270
    âHuh huh he justâ laughed he came up to me he was like âthat was greatâ 157270 159402
