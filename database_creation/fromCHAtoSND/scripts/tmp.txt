ya wanna get out of the chair Monica 
she never  actually insists that she talk
pretty  consistent with what she does with the real phone
she'll just say 
 hi hi 
no  I think she liked the ringing there are some 
 hi hi hi 
but there's no ringing associated with it and that was more
but at home she can't make that phone ring at her will 
this is very important to leave this on mummie 
I'm gonna talk to Nan for a couple of more minutes 
okay 
she wants to nurse I think I can probably talk while she nurses
do ya wanna nurse 
huh 
you have to leave that on 
don't touch that though 
don't touch 
it's not touching this 
it's just that it might be picking up her sucking 
I don't know if it would or not 
take it off 
I think that she is 
 take it oh that word that phrase she says 
 take it off 
or  she  she doesn't usually say 
 put it in 
but 
 take it out 
take it out 
I can't think of anything offhand right now 
but like her sweater something she'll wanna take it off 
all of a sudden she'll get an idea that she wants to take it off 
  put it on 
but she has a little hard time putting it on herself 
so I'm starting to help her do that 
 shoes clothing 
in general 
yeah she does but I can't think like just her toys 
actually I'm probably not very good I don't know what
I guess she's been going full time for four weeks 
at school 
and I have only been here with her  this week 
or two days 
so I actually don't have that much idea in terms of what she
she they do have a lot of educational toys there that she's
little holes 
and that she's spends an hour trying to do that 
and she's able to do it so that she is  fascinated
don't touch 
just don't touch that 
okay you're going to have to stop nursing if you touch it 
I think she does 
maybe in more of a negative sense than I'd want to 
sometimes it's my own fault because sometimes at home she will
and in the kitchen and I'll be tripping over her and say 
 Marie go play with your toys 
  in your room 
no she'll say  
 no 
and  I think she does knows what are toys an what aren't
 that's not a toy 
 we're not gonna play with that right now 
although I'm not consistent because I do let her play with
such as make up 
parts that it goes on I don't know if it's helped her  I
I think she's aware of all parts of her face in fact 
and and she has words she says 
for her face 
 cheeks ears eyes brows tongue 
gums 
tongue the tongue right 
pick out one characteristic 
 yeah 
 tongue 
tongue 
yeah there's that tongue in there huh 
let's see yes 
my husband's been feeding her in the morning oatmeal 
a cereal with some sunflower seeds and sesame seeds and raisins in
I don't know 
I don't think so 
she may have 
 but they don't look that much like houses to me 
I think that's why I chose to tell her 
that it was to just although of course she could have
okay let's go Marie
