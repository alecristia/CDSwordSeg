* general [2/2]
- [X] update the README to describe the recipes
- [X] properly copyright the project (Alex, Xuan Nga, Mathieu)
* data preparation [1/1]
- [X] check for festival binary at phonologizer startup
* algocomp [3/4]
- [X] troubleshoot oberon on step 3 segmentation
  - dibs OK though odd that performance for dibs is 1pc lower with the
    new phon set, no?? maybe forget, since we will rerun everything
    anyway...
  - ngrams OK
  - TP OK, odd that performance is 2pc higher now; notice that
    standard format cannot be created now because spaces between
    letters are lost
  - AG OK, changed to c3syll+functionwords standard format cannot be
    created bc spaces bet letters lost
  - Puddle: poor performance because testing on the whole thing!!!!
    --> we decide to test on last 20% for all corpora
- [X] Debug dmcmc segfault on non ADS corpora
      Processing fold 0.

- [X] median result of AG [3/3]
  - [X] Factorize AGu and AGc3sf
    - [X] in pipeline script
    - [X] in segment.py
  - [X] update AG scripts to run them 5 times and take the median
    - [X] add a --ag-median N option in segment.py
    - [X] update AG pipeline
  - [X] parallelize in do_AG_english ?
    Added a TODO flag
- [ ] Smart clusterization of crossevaluation [0/2]
  - [ ] parallelize dmcmc
  - [ ] parallelize puddle
* Winnipeg recipe [3/4]
- [X] debug wordmatch in full_WL/4_special_step.sh
- [X] update step 5 and 6
- [X] rerun all pipeline on oberon
- [ ] collapse results when computation are done
* Childes recipe
