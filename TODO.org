* TODO
** general [0/4]
- [ ] update the README to describe the recipes
- [ ] list software dependancies in the README
- [ ] properly licencing the project in GPL
  Because we internally use festival (GPL licenced) as phonologizer
  backend, we must licence the whole project in GPL. Ensure this licence
  is OK for all dependancies.
- [ ] properly copyright the project (Alex, Xuan Nga, Mathieu)
** data preparation [0/1]
- [ ] check for festival binary at phonologizer  startup
** algocomp [2/4]
- [X] troubleshoot oberon on step 3 segmentation
  - dibs OK though odd that performance for dibs is 1pc lower with the
  new phon set, no?? maybe forget, since we will rerun everything
  anyway...
  - ngrams OK
  - TP OK, odd that performance is 2pc higher now; notice that
    standard format cannot be created now because spaces between
    letters are lost
  - AG OK, changed to c3syll+functionwords standard format cannot be
    created bc spaces bet letters lost
  - Puddle: poor performance because testing on the whole thing!!!!
    --> we decide to test on last 20% for all corpora
- [X] Debug dmcmc segfault on non ADS corpora
    Processing fold 0.

- [ ] update AG scripts to run them 5 times and take the median
- [ ] Smart clusterization of crossevaluation
- [ ] parallelize AG and dmcmc
** Winnipeg recipe [2/4]
- [X] debug wordmatch in full_WL/4_special_step.sh
- [X] update step 5 and 6
- [ ] rerun all pipeline on oberon
