balloon

balloon
oh
smell that
nothing huh
she's sometimes really does talk
I'm trying to think lots of people's names people that
more animals and animal sounds
she says ball and she says ball for balloon and she says
she doesn't say cow but she says moo and you know
for some of those cat and a dog and a chick
come here Alice
and cheese
and hot
well I think she had hot before
juice
she uses cheese when she opens the refrigerator door and sees it
she says cheese cheese
and and juice
she says
and baba
those important things
only the blocks and the doll and the stuffed dog
well books
she has a lot of books
and she can say book too
she can't say telephone
but she says hi
she doesn't zip and unzip
we don't practice that
I mean Is that Dapper Dan
we don't have that and she's not encouraged to tie and untie
yes it's for sassy
we call it a sassy I don't even know why we do
let me put your shoes on
I guess she could
I just we just don't
I don't have any I don't have that toy
I have something with a zipper but I just don't play with it with
right
well I double knot them but I I don't know
I just we don't play with her shoes
oh pretty aware we have some animal books
mostly dogs and cats but getting to chicks and ducks and pigs
I have no idea what a camel says but we decided that a camel says
and whenever I say there's a camel she starts to smile cause she
so we have those animals and yeah and a turtle and a
yeah and we call squirrels kitty but just because she sees them
yeah yeah we have of course Lauren has a
she likes to comb her own hair and she will comb some animals that
well we have a hamster
actually I'm after a puppy right now
yeah but more entranced with this than with anything else she
probably less
she was in a stage then and we got her a phone and she played
but she did like the push button phone
okay Alice
we don't have a push button phone at home
at home I
mostly I just point and say what's that
I guess I'm thinking about it now
I don't really say can you say
I don't really say that I guess as often as I said it here
I was really aware that she wasn't saying anything
but that's why
she really did say more than she did last time
I can't tell you how much more verbal she is at home
she's doing things like this
she's exploring the whole house
it's she's never confined
it's impossible
I don't usually ask her what she wants she usually shows
but that was a situation of her being up here and it being on the
but if I say “What do you want” she'll go get it
but
she might if it was a doggie
because I really thought she wanted the doggie
yeah doggie she could say
and I think that was what I was trying to get her to to say
but I thought maybe she would say it if she couldn't reach it
but she's much she's really more physical than
all this throwing and everything
yeah she really is
I mean she would much more I mean she would much rather
you know what now I mean or books she'll look
she has a similar one with things to touch and look
she did
she put her finger through the hole yeah
she likes peekaboo
that's why I like this page a lot
and she can say peekaboo
peekaboo
look
where's the boy
don't pull it off
peekaboo
you like that
okay
who's that
