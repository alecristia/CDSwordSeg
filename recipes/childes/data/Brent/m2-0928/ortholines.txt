and then there's a bear playing in a waterfall
because I love water
can you turn the page
gotta turn the page
it's nice to drink
is he drinking out of a drinking fountain
it's splishy splashy
it's slippery and hard when it's ice
it's fluffy when it's snow
just turn one page
just turn one page
okay you all done with me reading again
it's nice and cool when it's rain
one page
it's fun in the bath tub
see he's in the bath tub
you like to take baths
you can see right through it
and see he's looking through the fish tank
some things float in water
like a boat
and some things sink
and see he's throwing coins in the water and they would sink
you want
does water have a shape
sometimes it's square
sometimes it's round
and sometimes it's bear shaped
want to turn the next page
but water is always best when you share it with friends
and the bear and all his friends are in the pool
go out to Grandma's pool tomorrow
but you are probably not gonna get in it
think the water might still be too cold
