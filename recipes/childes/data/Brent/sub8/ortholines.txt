Woody told them
the toy nodded
they already knew about the move
then Woody added quietly
and Andy's birthday party is today
the toys panicked
the guests are already arriving
Ham
the piggy bank
the other toys ran to the window
the guests are already arriving
squealed Ham the pig
the piggy bank
other toys ran to the window
they saw Andy's friends carrying gifts
the toys were afraid
what if Andy got new toys

Woody reassured them

Woody

but Woody sent some toy soldiers to watch
the party anyway
and reported by walkie talkie
luckily most of the gifts were clothes and games
then Woody opened

lemme start over
but Woody sent some toy soldiers to watch the party
and reported by walkie talkie
luckily most of the gifts were clothes and games
don't do that Boo
then Andy opened his last present
the soldier gasped
it's an amazing toy
but the walkie talkie stopped working before the soldier
relay the report
later Andy put the new toy on his bed
after he left
Woody and the other toys approached the stranger
suddenly the new toy jumped up
my name is Buzz lightyear
I come to your planet in peace
my ship crashed
landing here by mistake
Rex the dinosaur
got very excited
are you really here from outer space
Woody sighed
of course not
he's a toy like us
excuse me
but I think the word you are looking for is
Buzz told him
I'm the captain of the space fleet
and as soon as I fix my spaceship
I'm going back home
all of the toys were impressed except Woody
I have special wings
I can fly
Buzz told him
no you can't
Woody said
can said Buzz
cannot snapped Woody
Buzz replied
yes I can
and I'll prove it to you
then
then Buzz leaped off the bed
to infinity and beyond
he cried
Buzz landed on the rubber ball bouncing
onto a toy race
race car track
sliding up
and down
and up
then went flying through the air
he landed right in front of Woody
in front of Woody
Buzz
that wasn't flying
that was falling with style
Woody said
but the toys thought Buzz was great
see Buzz
was that Woody
that Woody
Woody
Buzz
Buzz
mhm
mkay
suddenly the toys heard
shouting
it was Sid the boy next door
Sid liked to blow up his toys
and that's just what
he was doing now
the toys were glad they lived with Andy
Andy loved his toys especially his new one
he began playing with Buzz all the time
Woody became jealous
one night Andy was going to
excuse me
one night Andy was going to Pizza planet
for dinner
you can only bring one toy
his mother said
Woody wanted Andy to bring him not Buzz
so he tried to make Buzz fall behind Andy's dresser
Woody aimed R C a radio controlled car at him
zoom
Buzz jumped out of the way
just in time

the car hit
hit the globe instead
but the globe hit the lamp and knocked Buzz out of the window
all the toys rushed over to see what had happened
they looked at R C
the little car whirled and whirled
the toys were surprised and angry that
they looked at Woody
you used R C to knock Buzz out of the window
Potato head accused
“no no” Woody cried
I didn't mean to
the other toys didn't believe him
Woody did not know what to say
all the toys were angry at him
Bo peep felt sad
she couldn't believe Woody would do such a terrible thing
see Bo peep
just then Andy came into the room looking for Buzz
but since Andy couldn't find his new toy
he took Woody in the car instead
