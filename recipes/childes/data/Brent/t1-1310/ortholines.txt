God made the world

God gave Adam an important job
Adam named all the animals that God had made
look there's a turtle
and a sheep says baa
and a bear
and a monkey and a bird
and a lion
and a dove which is also a bird
but Adam was not happy
he was very lonely
Adam was the only person in the whole world
so God made a woman
her name was Eve
Eve was Adam's wife
Adam and Eve lived happily in the garden of Eden
there were all kinds of fruit trees in the garden
God told Adam and Eve they could eat fruit from any tree except one
this was God's special tree
one day a serpent tricked Eve
he told her to eat the fruit from God's special tree
then she would be as smart as God
the serpent was telling a lie
Eve believed the serpent
she ate the fruit from God's special tree
then Adam ate some too
