to seek their fortune
off they went together
each with a bright kerchief
for a knapsack
when they came to a fork in the road they bid each other goodbye
and good luck
then one went this way one went that way and one the other
soon the first little pig met a man
carrying a great bundle of straw
please sir
he asked
could you spare enough straw for me to build myself a house
the man did as he was asked
and soon the first one
first little pig
had builded himself a cozy little house of straw
before long a hungry wolf knocked
at the door of the little straw
knock knock knock
little pig little pig let me come in
he called
no not by the hair of my chinie chin chin
answered the first little pig
then I'll huff
and I'll puff
and I'll blow your house in
said the wolf
and sure enough
he huffed
yeah
he puffed
and he blew the house in
but before the house came tumbling down
the first pig had run out the back door and into the
he decided then and there to find his two brothers
the second little pig walked along until he met a man wheeling
please sir
he asked
could you spare me enough sticks for me to build myself a house
the man did as he was asked and soon the second little pig
had built himself a snug little house of sticks
before long the wolf was at his door and he was still hungry
little pig little pig let me come in
he called
no not by the hair of my chinnie chin chin
answered the second little pig
then I'll huff
and I'll puff
and I'll
blow your house in
said the wolf

he huffed
and he puffed
and he blew the house in
but before the house came clattering down the second little pig had
he decided then and there to find his two brothers
after the third little pig had walked for a while
he met a man pulling a cart heaped with bricks
please sir
he asked
could you spare enough bricks for me to build myself a house
the man did as he was asked
and soon the third little pig had built himself a solid
pause
after a while his two brothers and his mother found their way
and they all decided to live together once more
one morning
Mama Pig decided to make vegetable soup for lunch
she filled the the big iron kettle that hung in the fireplace
added an apron full of fresh vegetables from the garden
and lit a fire up under it
just as she placed the lid on the kettle there was a knock at the
knock knock knock knock knock knock knock

it was the wolf of course and he was hungrier than ever
little pig little pig let me come in
he called
no not by the hair of my chinnie chin chin
answered the third little pig
then I'll huff
and I'll puff
and I'll blow your house in
said the wolf
and sure enough he huffed
and puffed
and he huffed
and he puffed
and he huffed again Jaylen
and he puffed
but he couldn't blow in the solid little brick house
after the wolf had a chance to catch his breath
he knocked at the door once more
knock
if you won't open this door I'll climb down your chimney
still no one opened the door and soon the wolf could be heard
ugly little wolf
quietly the third little pig took the lid off the kettle
then a swoosh
swoosh
down the chimney came the wolf and splash into the kettle he
quick as a winkle and the third little pig put the lid
now Jaylen
to celebrate the occasion Mama Pig took a crusty rutabaga pie from
everyone had a great big slice and washed it down with
and that's the end of our story
