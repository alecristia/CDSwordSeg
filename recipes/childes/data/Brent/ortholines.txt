“guess how much I love you” he said
“oh I don't think I could guess that” said Big nut brown hare
Mandy look
“this much”

“this much”
stretching out his arms as wide as they could go
Big nut brown hare had even longer arms
“but I love you this much” he said

“I love you as high as I can reach”

“high as I can reach”
said Little nut brown hare
“and I love you as high as I can reach”
said Big nut brown hair
“that is very high” thought Little nut brown hare
“I wish I had arms like that”
then Little nut brown hare had a good idea
he tumbled upside down and reached up the tree trunk with his feet
“I love you all the way up to my toes” he said
“and I love you all the way up to your toes”
said Big nut brown hare
swinging him up
over his head
whee

“I love you as high as I can hop”
laughed Little nut brown hare
bouncing up and down

up and down
“but I love you as high as I can hop” smiled Big nut brown hare
and he hopped so high
that his ears touched the branches above
“that's good hopping” thought Little nut brown hare
“I wish I could hop like that”
“I love you all the way down the river”
“and all the way down the lane as far as the river”
cried Little nut brown hare
“I love you across the river and over the hills”
said Big nut brown hare
“that is very far”
thought Little nut brown hare
he was almost too sleepy to think any more
then he looked beyond the thornbushes out into the big dark night
nothing could be farther than the sky
“I love you right up to the moon” he said
and closed his eyes
“oh that's far” thought Little nut brown hare
“that is very very far”
Big nut brown hare settled Little nut brown hare into his bed
he leaned over and kissed him good night
give him a kiss
then he layed down close by and whispered with a smile
“I love you right up to the moon”
“and back”

no it's not proper
Mama read you a story though
that's pretty proper
proper
the three little pigs
one
two
three little pigs
what's that
that right
yep
but it was
when Mama Pig thought her little
her three little pigs were old enough
she packed them each a lunch
kissed them
on the cheek
and sent them into the world
to seek their fortune
off they went together
each with a bright kerchief
for a knapsack
when they came to a fork in the road they bid each other goodbye
and good luck
then one went this way one went that way and one the other
soon the first little pig met a man
carrying a great bundle of straw
please sir
he asked
could you spare enough straw for me to build myself a house
the man did as he was asked
and soon the first one
first little pig
had builded himself a cozy little house of straw
before long a hungry wolf knocked
at the door of the little straw
knock knock knock
little pig little pig let me come in
he called
no not by the hair of my chinie chin chin
answered the first little pig
then I'll huff
and I'll puff
and I'll blow your house in
said the wolf
and sure enough
he huffed
yeah
he puffed
and he blew the house in
but before the house came tumbling down
the first pig had run out the back door and into the
he decided then and there to find his two brothers
the second little pig walked along until he met a man wheeling
please sir
he asked
could you spare me enough sticks for me to build myself a house
the man did as he was asked and soon the second little pig
had built himself a snug little house of sticks
before long the wolf was at his door and he was still hungry
little pig little pig let me come in
he called
no not by the hair of my chinnie chin chin
answered the second little pig
then I'll huff
and I'll puff
and I'll
blow your house in
said the wolf
and sure enough Jaylen
he huffed
and he puffed
and he blew the house in
but before the house came clattering down the second little pig had
he decided then and there to find his two brothers
after the third little pig had walked for a while
he met a man pulling a cart heaped with bricks
please sir
he asked
could you spare enough bricks for me to build myself a house
the man did as he was asked
and soon the third little pig had built himself a solid
pause
after a while his two brothers and his mother found their way
and they all decided to live together once more
one morning
Mama Pig decided to make vegetable soup for lunch
she filled the the big iron kettle that hung in the fireplace
added an apron full of fresh vegetables from the garden
and lit a fire up under it
just as she placed the lid on the kettle there was a knock at the
knock knock knock knock knock knock knock
knock knock knock knock knock
you do it
you do it
knock knock knock knock knock
you do it
you are not gonna do it
knock knock knock knock knock
you do it

knock knock knock knock knock
one more time

well I'm gonna finish reading the story then you
it was the wolf of course and he was hungrier than ever
little pig little pig let me come in
he called
no not by the hair of my chinnie chin chin
answered the third little pig
then I'll huff
and I'll puff
and I'll blow your house in
said the wolf
and sure enough he huffed
and puffed
and he huffed
and he puffed
and he huffed again Jaylen
and he puffed
but he couldn't blow in the solid little brick house
after the wolf had a chance to catch his breath
he knocked at the door once more
knock
if you won't open this door I'll climb down your chimney
still no one opened the door and soon the wolf could be heard
ugly little wolf
quietly the third little pig took the lid off the kettle
then a swoosh
swoosh
down the chimney came the wolf and splash into the kettle he
quick as a winkle and the third little pig put the lid
now Jaylen
to celebrate the occasion Mama Pig took a crusty rutabaga pie from
everyone had a great big slice and washed it down with
and that's the end of our story

what about
what about this one
this is a long book
long ago in a faraway land
lived a poor orphan named Aladin
one day in the market Aladin took some bread
the sultan's guard chased him but Aladin and his pet monkey Abu
then Aladin saw two hungry children and gave the bread to them
things will change
he told Abu
someday we'll live in a palace
that afternoon the sultan told Princess Jasmine she was to marry a
I will marry only for love
she cried
Jasmine disguised herself and ran away
in the market she took an apple but couldn't pay the angry
Aladin rescued her
the merchant called the guard
they released the princess but took Aladin to the palace
meanwhile Jafar the sultans's evil counselor disguised himself
help me find a very special lamp
he said to Aladin
and I'll set you free
god bless you
Jafar took Aladin and Abu to the Cave of wonders
touch nothing but the lamp
he said
a magic carpet appeared and led Aladin to the lamp
Aladin reached for it
Abu grabbed a ruby
the cave began to collapse
the magic carpet saved Aladin and Abu
but all three were trapped
what's so special about this old lamp
Aladin wondered aloud
as Aladin rubbed the dust off an enormous genie appeared
Master he said
I can grant you three wishes
now let's get out of here
Aladin's first wish was to become a prince
so Jasmine would marry him
he promised to use his third wish to set the genie free
later that day Aladin arrived at the palace in grand style
I'm prince Ali
he told the sultan
that evening Prince Ali took Jasmine for a ride on his wonderful
soon she became suspicious
aren't you the boy from the market
she asked
no I really am Prince Ali
he said
then the magic carpet took them back to the palace
that was wonderful
she said
sighed Jasmine
she had fallen in love
things are finally going right
Aladin happily told Abu
but again Jafar had ordered the guards to get rid of Aladin
after the guards tossed Aladin into the sea
he summoned the genie and used his second wish to save his own life
Aladin returned to the palace with the lamp
but Iago Jafar's parrot stole it
so Jafar became the genie's master
make me sultan
Jafar commanded
make Jasmine and her father my slave
the genie was forced to obey
Jafar used his second wish to become a powerful sorcerer
changed Aladin back into a beggar and sent him far away
the magic carpet helped Aladin return to the palace
Jafar was furious that Aladin found a way to trick him
the genie still has more power than you'll ever have
he said
it worked
Jafar used his third wish to become a genie
but he forgot one thing
every genie must live in a lamp and so Jafar disappeared
the sultan decided to let Jasmine choose her own husband
I choose you
she told Aladin
Aladin's dream had come true
but he didn't forget his third wish
he said
genie you are free forever
the end
you say
oh no not another “the end”
yeah
see
books have a “the end”

what's that
my very first Winnie the Pooh
Pooh's neighborhood
let's see
I say
it's a splendid day in the neighborhood
said Owl
it's a nice day here too
said Winnie the Pooh
exactly what I'm saying
said Owl
a perfectly splendid day in the neighborhood
which neighborhood are we talking about
asked Pooh
neighborhood
said owl
our neighborhood
the place where we live and our neighbors live and are neighborly
oh
said Pooh
it is a splendid day
isn't it
quite
said owl
now I'm off for an owl's eye view
he flew up and circled once around Pooh's house
what does it look like from up there
called Pooh
I can see the Hundred acre woods spread out below me
said owl
and it's a fine place indeed
as owl flew off
Pooh began to think about what it means to live in a neighborhood
he thought perhaps he would take a neighborly present to his
he took a honey pot out of his cupboard and tied a nice blue
then he tucked it comfortably under his arm and stomped down
house
but when he reached his thoughtful spot
which is halfway between his house and Piglet's
Pooh suddenly had a thought
I could take this path straight to Piglet's house
or
I could go up the path and around the whole neighborhood
and sooner or later the path would take me to Piglet's house
and that is what he did
after he had walked for a time
he came to the house where Kanga and Roo lived
hello Kanga
said Pooh
I'm just on my way to deliver this neighborly present to
but Pooh dear
Piglet lives that way
said Kanga pointing down the very path by which Pooh had come
yes said Pooh
but today I'm going the long way
oh I see
said Kanga
in that case
perhaps you should join us for a snack
come on Pooh
cried Roo
we are going to the picnic spot
Pooh said he was feeling a bit eleven o'clock
so they all went together past the sandy pit where Roo plays
up to the picnic spot to share a little something
half an hour and one picnic basket later
Pooh thanked Kanga
tucked Piglet's honey pot back under his arm
and stomped down the path towards Rabbit's house

and the only reason for being a bee that I know of is making
and then he got up and said
and the only reason for making honey is so I can so
so he began to climb the tree
he climbed and he climbed and he climbed and as he
he sang a little song to himself
it went like this
isn't it funny how a bear likes honey
buzz buzz buzz
I wonder why he does
then he climbed a little further
and a little further and then just a little further
by that time he had thought of another song
it's very funny thought that if bears were bees
they'd build their nests at the bottom of trees
and that being so
if the bees were bears
you shouldn't have to climb up all these stairs
he was getting rather tired
by this time
so that is why he sang a complaining song
he went nearly there now
and if he just stood on that
he was nearly there now and if he just stood on that branch
you think that's enough
that's enough

Jeremy moves to another part of the pond

excuse me
but I think the word you are looking for is
Buzz told him
I'm the captain of the space fleet
and as soon as I fix my spaceship
I'm going back home
all of the toys were impressed except Woody
I have special wings
I can fly
Buzz told him
no you can't
Woody said
can said Buzz
cannot snapped Woody
Buzz replied
yes I can
and I'll prove it to you
then
then Buzz leaped off the bed
to infinity and beyond
he cried
Buzz landed on the rubber ball bouncing
onto a toy race
race car track
sliding up
and down
and up
then went flying through the air
he landed right in front of Woody
in front of Woody
Buzz
that wasn't flying
that was falling with style
Woody said
but the toys thought Buzz was great
see Buzz
was that Woody
that Woody
Woody
Buzz
Buzz
mhm
mkay
suddenly the toys heard
shouting
it was Sid the boy next door
Sid liked to blow up his toys
and that's just what
he was doing now
the toys were glad they lived with Andy
Andy loved his toys especially his new one
he began playing with Buzz all the time
Woody became jealous
one night Andy was going to
excuse me
one night Andy was going to Pizza planet
for dinner
you can only bring one toy
his mother said
Woody wanted Andy to bring him not Buzz
so he tried to make Buzz fall behind Andy's dresser
Woody aimed R C a radio controlled car at him
zoom
Buzz jumped out of the way
just in time
see Buzz

see R C
Woody has got R C
yeah
look

there go Potato head
and dinosaur

Buzz and Woody

yeah
okay
okay let's turn the page
okay
stop now
okay
the car hit
hit the globe instead
but the globe hit the lamp and knocked Buzz out of the window
all the toys rushed over to see what had happened
they looked at R C
the little car whirled and whirled
the toys were surprised and angry that
they looked at Woody
you used R C to knock Buzz out of the window
Potato head accused
“no no” Woody cried
I didn't mean to
the other toys didn't believe him
Woody did not know what to say
all the toys were angry at him
Bo peep felt sad
she couldn't believe Woody would do such a terrible thing
see Bo peep
just then Andy came into the room looking for Buzz
but since Andy couldn't find his new toy
he took Woody in the car instead
Buzz
yeah Buzz
Buzz was in the bushes nearby
the car leave he quickly ran and grab hold to the bumper
see him

remember that song
it says
god is perfect and right and good
he is the king of a perfect kingdom
nothing bad or wrong can live there
sometimes we do bad or wrong things
but god sent Jesus to take the blame for the wrong things
he took the blame as if it were his fault
that makes us perfect right and good
now we can be in god's perfect kingdom
Jesus is like the door to get there

Jesus you are my friend
dear Jesus will you be my best friend
I already love you and you love me
so how about it
my bible says
you'll always be with me even at nighttime
I love your pretty stars but I don't like the dark
thanks for being with me at night
Jesus I can talk to you anytime anywhere
all day long
and all night long I know you care
thanks for staying awake so you can hear my prayers
Jesus do you ever feel sad
or mad
when I feel sad or mad
I know you are still my friend
I like having a friend like you
be careful
be gentle with the book
gentle
some days nobody can come over to play with me
when I feel lonely I know you are still with me
I like feeling your love
I'm so glad you are my special friend up in heaven
someday I'll bring my friends and we can have a peanut butter and
thank you Jesus for being my special friend
I can't see you but I know you are always there
I can feel your love and care
I will never leave thee nor forsake thee

okay let's read the next book
the velveteen rabbit
it peeped out of the boy's Christmas stocking
a splendid velveteen rabbit
in the nursery the toy trains both said that they were real
what is real
wondered the rabbit
when a child loves you for so long that you become worn and
said the skin horse
then you become real
how the rabbit longed to become real
I see your little nose
one night the boy took the rabbit to bed with him
and hugged him very tightly
he hugged him very tightly like this
just like I'm hugging you
from that day on
rabbit and boy went everywhere together
during a picnic the rabbit saw real live wild rabbits hoping
oh how he wished he were real
real
can you say real
can you say real
Mags can you say real
well
that's something
the boy became ill one day
he had to stay in bed and could not play
but the rabbit stayed with him
when the boy became well again
the doctor sent him to the seashore
and ordered everything in his room
disinfected and all the toys burned
well how do you
what do you think about that babe
I see you
I see you
the rabbit was thrown on the trash heap for burning
he cried and a tear a real tear fell to the ground
on that very spot a
is that

do you think that's a kitty cat
it looks a little bit like a kitty cat
kitty cat
can you say that
kitty cat
alright Maggie
yeah
say it again
kitty cat
who is that
is that a kitty cat
kitty cat
on that very spot a beautiful flower blossomed
out stepped a fairy
the the fairy flew with the rabbit to the woods
she set him down among the real rabbits
and
with a kiss maked
a kiss
like this
she kissed him
just like that
like this
give Mommy a kiss
no

give Mommy a kiss
give Mommy a kiss
hey

the rabbit

and ran for joy with joy
now he was a real rabbit
next spring a rabbit hopped up to the boy
