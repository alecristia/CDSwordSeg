okay let's read the next book
the velveteen rabbit
it peeped out of the boy's Christmas stocking
a splendid velveteen rabbit
in the nursery the toy trains both said that they were real
what is real
wondered the rabbit
when a child loves you for so long that you become worn and
said the skin horse
then you become real
how the rabbit longed to become real
I see your little nose
one night the boy took the rabbit to bed with him
and hugged him very tightly
he hugged him very tightly like this
just like I'm hugging you
from that day on
rabbit and boy went everywhere together
during a picnic the rabbit saw real live wild rabbits hoping
oh how he wished he were real
real
can you say real
can you say real
Mags can you say real
well
that's something
the boy became ill one day
he had to stay in bed and could not play
but the rabbit stayed with him
when the boy became well again
the doctor sent him to the seashore
and ordered everything in his room
disinfected and all the toys burned
well how do you
what do you think about that babe
I see you
I see you
the rabbit was thrown on the trash heap for burning
he cried and a tear a real tear fell to the ground
on that very spot a
is that
that's a rabbit
do you think that's a kitty cat
it looks a little bit like a kitty cat
kitty cat
can you say that
kitty cat
alright Maggie
yeah
say it again
kitty cat
who is that
is that a kitty cat
kitty cat
on that very spot a beautiful flower blossomed
out stepped a fairy
the the fairy flew with the rabbit to the woods
she set him down among the real rabbits
and
with a kiss maked
a kiss
like this
she kissed him
just like that
like this
give Mommy a kiss
no
no
give Mommy a kiss
give Mommy a kiss
hey
don't hit Mommy
give Mommy a kiss
Mommy kiss
the rabbit
the rabbit leaped
and ran for joy with joy
now he was a real rabbit
next spring a rabbit hopped up to the boy
he looks so familiar
thought the boy
but he never knew that it was his own dear rabbit grown real
