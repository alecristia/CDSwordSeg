Terry is upset when the other taxis play racing games up and
a hedgehog is stuck in the middle of the road because he is so
Terry has a plan to help the hedgehog
he makes fun of the taxi behind him
the dirty taxi is growing more and more angry and lots of black
the taxis have to slow down in order to see through the smoke
Terry rescues the hedgehog

the hedgehog is very grateful for Terry's help
in the future stay on the grass where it is safe
