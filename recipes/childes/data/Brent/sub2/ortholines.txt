most baby or child formulated sun screens are gentle on sensitive
test a small amount on the inside of the baby's wrist

over her face and body
choose a hypoallergenic or cream or lotion
gels may contain alcohol which can dry the skin

what else should we know
look for an S P F of at least fifteen
for protection against U V A and U V B rays
