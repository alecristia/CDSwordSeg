look
you either gonna drink and hold the bottle or play with the toys
you cannot drink
and play with the toys and expect to still be able to drink your
it just don't work like that
so you have one or the other
you got a bottle in your hand
and drink it
or you can put the bottle down and play with your toys
but you are not a octopus
you don't have eight different arms
you don't do one thing at a time
you know maybe you can do two
but I don't know too many people that can at the same time
and do it successfully
looking at me like I'm crazy
you know I'm telling truth
you know what
I left my cup of juice in there when I went and washed my hands
going back and get my juice
there it is
oh that's good and cold
