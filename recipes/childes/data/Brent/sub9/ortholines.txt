I'm on the inside
on which side are you

remember that song
it says
god is perfect and right and good
he is the king of a perfect kingdom
nothing bad or wrong can live there
sometimes we do bad or wrong things
but god sent Jesus to take the blame for the wrong things
he took the blame as if it were his fault
that makes us perfect right and good
now we can be in god's perfect kingdom
Jesus is like the door to get there
he is the way to get to god
one door and only one and yet its sides are two
inside and outside
on which side are you
one door and only one and yet its sides are two

Jesus you are my friend
dear Jesus will you be my best friend
I already love you and you love me
so how about it
my bible says
you'll always be with me even at nighttime
I love your pretty stars but I don't like the dark
thanks for being with me at night
Jesus I can talk to you anytime anywhere
all day long
and all night long I know you care
thanks for staying awake so you can hear my prayers
Jesus do you ever feel sad
or mad
when I feel sad or mad
I know you are still my friend
I like having a friend like you
be careful
be gentle with the book
gentle
some days nobody can come over to play with me
when I feel lonely I know you are still with me
I like feeling your love
I'm so glad you are my special friend up in heaven
someday I'll bring my friends and we can have a peanut butter and
thank you Jesus for being my special friend
I can't see you but I know you are always there
I can feel your love and care
I will never leave thee nor forsake thee

the velveteen rabbit
it peeped out of the boy's Christmas stocking
a splendid velveteen rabbit
in the nursery the toy trains both said that they were real
what is real
wondered the rabbit
when a child loves you for so long that you become worn and
said the skin horse
then you become real
how the rabbit longed to become real
I see your little nose
one night the boy took the rabbit to bed with him
and hugged him very tightly
he hugged him very tightly like this
just like I'm hugging you
from that day on
rabbit and boy went everywhere together
during a picnic the rabbit saw real live wild rabbits hoping
oh how he wished he were real
real
can you say real
can you say real
Mags can you say real
well
that's something
the boy became ill one day
he had to stay in bed and could not play
but the rabbit stayed with him
when the boy became well again
the doctor sent him to the seashore
and ordered everything in his room
disinfected and all the toys burned
well how do you
what do you think about that babe
I see you
I see you
the rabbit was thrown on the trash heap for burning
he cried and a tear a real tear fell to the ground
on that very spot a

on that very spot a beautiful flower blossomed
out stepped a fairy
the the fairy flew with the rabbit to the woods
she set him down among the real rabbits
and
with a kiss maked
a kiss
like this
she kissed him
just like that
like this
give Mommy a kiss
