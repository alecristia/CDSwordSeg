I think we should make some arrows for somebody
for Robin Hood
okay
we need to make another thing to put the arrows in
okay
oh
this is going to be an arrow
what are you going to do with your arrows Robin
huh
you are gonna shoot em at a target
what doesn't
okay thank you
that was really brave Abe that was really nice I'm glad you did
sure they do
uhhuh
uhhuh right here where the feathers go
is that the front or the top
oh where feathers are is the bottom hm
uhhuh
uhhuh so you have to be very careful with them right
is that how you want it
okay
how's that
okay
you thought of what last night
oh to make arrows
when did you think about it
oh did you have a dream about it or were you just thinking
oh you were just thinking huh
were you sleeping while you were thinking
oh
I don't know we'll find somebody
what did you think
I'm gonna be little John
when you were thinking last night what were you thinking with
uhhuh
what
that book
what
he taped that page
oh that was a long time ago
what did they pass by
what did they pass by
you want ta shoot it
okay you grab this
and you put this here
and then you shoot it
okay oh hey
the scab came off your lip today does it feel okay
good if you need ointment on it let me know do you want me to
make the target stand up
she was happy when the scab came off
Mommy said that when she started to leave
oh when she started to leave for school tonight
how about a piece of candy
okay here you go
what happened
did you cross the street by yourself
which street
at the zoo today
well you know you should wait for Mom okay
her didn't she didn't come so you went by yourself
well you should wait for her it's real dangerous crossing the
you did look
yeah except there were no cars good how's that
you sure can
that's pretty good
look you hold it like this
you grab the string like this
put the arrow in here like this
sure
not quite far enough here I'll hold the target closer you need
okay here we'll put the target right here
and you can come sit in my lap and I'll help you do you need some
okay don't pick at it now
oh put one hand here put the other hand here and you rest this on
are you ready
when I say
let go
let go ready
set go oh pretty close huh
it's hard to make a hole we'll have to get a special type of target
are you ready to shoot another one
tell me when you are ready
okay wow
we knocked the target off didn't we
okay
I'll get my legs up I don't want no alligator to bite my toes
okay I'll hold the target for you
okay did you get him
say would you like a sword
would you like a sword
yeah do you remember what a sword is
what's a sword
would you like a sword
oh you like your bow and arrow and that's enough
we need to make something to keep your arrows in don't we
I bet Mommy could make something
me too
what
what is
show me again
oh the quiver to keep the arrows in
a quiver that's called a quiver I think I'm not sure I'll have to
what
bring me your brown bag your mailman bag
see it on the floor over there
know what we could do
we could put the arrows in here and pretend this is a quiver
and make a quiver
I don't think we want to cut this up Mommy made this look what does
it says mail bag
we could use this as a quiver
what is he doing
your bunny
let's see it is I didn't know that
oh did you tell her too
okay set it up and we'll shoot it
what
what
oh you picked the rest of your scab off
let's put some ointment on that okay
here we go
yeah Robin Hood has a bow and arrow just like yours are you glad I
the bow
this is a bow those are arrows and that's a quiver
you think we could make a feather out of paper
yeah we could color it
okay is that a good looking feather
I have to cut it out first okay
I'm not
so I can look at it when I draw
good idea okay where's the scissors
I know but I'm gonna use em for a second okay
they are
if these are too little how come I'm using em
if I'm using them are they still too little
are you sure
oh I can't use em
you know what
this isn't quite sturdy enough I know we have some poster board
where's my pen at
here it is
what
we could couldn't we
I don't know if that would work though I think that it would be
is this a good feather
so you think we could make the quiver out of paper too
let me see if I can use your scissors they are not too small
two fingers in at one time
I don't need to because my fingers are pretty big see
do you put two fingers in
okay you show me how you put two fingers in oh I see Two
should we tape it
okay
there you go why don't you go look in the mirror
what happened
the mirror that you got at easter got lost
is there another mirror that you can look at
why don't you look and see if you like your feather
you like it
do you want an orange quiver
all we have to do is cut the know out
know they are too big for two to go in but they work fine with
would you like it like that
or a square
okay god you sure do look like Robin Hood
that string you found is good
take the knot out
you think Mommy had a good idea huh
when did she have that idea
right before she left
do you mean take the knot out
or untie the knot
okay
yeah see
we have to get the bottom fixed and we are in good shape
do you think it's gonna work alright
it's almost ready
okay just a second I have to finish this okay let me see
that's a good idea
I think so
tie it to your chin
I can fix it so it won't fall down without tying it to your chin
I don't know we'll have to find somebody
Jean downstairs
