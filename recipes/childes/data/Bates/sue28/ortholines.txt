can you count when you put them in
one
can you figure out which one it goes in
which one does it go in
look at the shape
you see the shape of it
can you find one of these that looks the same as that
you might have to turn it
so it will fit
which one do you think it will go in
which one
no that's too skinny
this is too skinny to put that in
that's the easy way out
find the right shape
now look at the end
see
how it goes like that
do you find one like that
which one of these matches that

can you put the rest in
that's right
have to turn it around so it'll fit
like you do your puzzles at home
have to turn them until they fit

just keep going around and around until it goes in
keep working at it
turn it some more
