we looked and we saw him the cat in the hat
and he said to us why do you sit there like that
I know it is wet and the sun is not sunny
but we can have lots of good fun that is funny
what does that mean
mkay
I have some good games we would play said the cat
I know some new tricks said the cat in the hat
a lot of good tricks
I will show them to you
your mother will not mind at all if I do
then Sally and I did not know what to say
our mother was out of the house for the day
but our fish said no no
make that cat go away
tell that cat in the hat you do not want to play
he should not be here
he should not be about
he should not be here when your mother is out
no no
have no fear said the cat in the hat
my tricks are not bad
why we can have lots of good fun if you wish with a game that I
put me down said the fish
this is no fun at all
put me down said the fish
I do not wish to fall
have no fear said the cat
I will not leave you fall
I will hold you up high as I stand on a ball
with a book on one hand and a cup on my hat
and that is not all I can do said the cat
maybe you could help me read this story
why did they what
what do you mean
oh I see what you mean
like that
like that
like what
oh because they are so surprised
because the cat in the hat is doing some strange tricks
look at all these things he has
he says
I can hold up two books and a cake
are you sleepy
okay
look at me said the cat with a cup and a cake on top of
I can hold up two books
I can hold up the fish
and a little toy ship and some milk on a dish
and look
I can hop up and down on the ball
but that is not all
oh no
that is not all
look at me
look at me
look at me now
it is fun to have fun but you have to know how
I can hold up the cup and the milk and the cake
I can hold up these books and the fish on the rake
I can hold the toy ship and a little toy man
and look
with my tail I can hold a red fan
I can fan with one hand as I hop on the ball
but that is not all
oh no that is not all
that is what the cat said when he fell on his head
he came down with a bump from up there on the ball and Sally and
because he slipped on the ball and he dropped them all
right
okay
and our fish came down too and fell into a pot
he said do I like this
and no I do not
this is not a good game said our fish as he lit
no I do not like it not one little bit
now look what you did said the fish to the cat
now look at this house
now look at this look at that
you sank our toy ship
sank it deep in the cake
you shook up our house and you bent our new rake
you should not be here when your mother is not
so get out of this house said the fish in the pot
oh look at all these things that he did
he bent the rake
spilled the milk
but I like to be here
oh I like it a lot said the cat in the hat to the fish
I will not go away
I do not wish to go
and so said the cat in the hat so so so I
and then he ran out
and then fast as a fox the cat in the hat came back in
a big red wood box
now look at this trick said the cat
take a look
then he got up on top of the tip of his head
I call this game fun in a box said the cat
in this box are two things I will show to you now
you will like these two things said the cat with a bow
I will pick up the book
you will see something new
two things and I call them Thing One and Thing Two
these things will not bite you
they want to have fun
get out of the box Thing Two and Thing One
then they ran to us fast
they said how do you do
would you like to shake hands with Thing One and Thing Two

I will pick up the book
you will see something new
on this is Thing One and Thing Two
we've already talked about them

okay
Sally and I did not know what to do
so we had to shake hands with Thing One and Thing Two
we shook their hands but our fish said no no
these things should not be in the house
make them go
what would you do if they were in your house
huh
would you tell them to get out
and say get out Thing One and Thing Two
and what if they didn't get out
then what would you do
then they couldn't come back in
so turn the page
have no fear little fish said the cat in the hat
these things are good things
and he gave them a pat
they are tame oh so tame
they have come here to play
they will give you some fun on this wet wet wet day
you turn the page
now here is a game that they like said the cat
they like to fly kites said the cat in the hat
no not in the house said the fish in the pot
they should not fly kites in the house
they should not
oh the things they will bump
the things they will hit
then Sally and I saw them run down the hall
we saw those two things bump their kites on the wall
bump thump thump bump bump thump thump
what's happening here
huh
everything's falling apart
what is their mommy gonna say
Hhh
what would your mommy say if she came in and saw everything all
would she be mad
let me take a drink of coffee here
okay
turn the page
oh you turned two pages
no that's okay
then those things ran about with big jumps bumps and
oh you missed that page
here
turn back to it
Thing Two and Thing One they ran up they ran down
on the string of one kite we saw mother's new gown
her gown with the dots that are pink white and red
then we saw one kite bump on the head of her bed
uhoh
look it
they have Mother's new dress on the line of the kites
think she's gonna be very happy about that
no
in fact she might get pretty mad and spank them
then those things ran about with big bumps jumps and
and I said I do not like the way that they play
if mother could see this oh what would she say
that's right
what else would she say though
and what else
would she tell them to clean it up
she would
dear
I have something on my coat
I think it's something that we had in our tortillas
yeah
I'll have to take it off later
okay next page
then
take this stuff off my coat
take the coat off
because I'm cold now
I wanna keep it on
oh no
then the fish said look
look
here mother is on her way home
oh what will she do to us
what will she say
oh she will not like it to find us this way
uhoh
do something fast
said the fish
do you hear
I saw your mother your mother is near
as fast as you can think of something to do
you will have to get rid of Thing One and Thing Two
uhoh
so as fast as I could I went after my net
I said with my net I could get them I bet
I bet with my net I could get those things yet
oh
so he caught the two things
and told the cat in the hat take those two things away
oh dear said the cat you did not like our game
oh dear
what a shame
then he shut up the things in the box with a hook and the cat
that is good said the fish
he is gone

Then we saw him pick up all the things that were down
he picked up the cake and the rake and the gown the milk

and he said that is that
and then he was gone with a tip of his hat
and then their mother came in and said you two did you
