Fredrick
you made a Fredrick and he's black
he does have a tail
wow
and where does Fredrick live
in the book
he does
where does Fredrick and his family live
do they live in the old stone wall
oh do we see an old stone wall while we were driving
we did
should we read Fredrick
all along the meadow
where the cows grazed and the horses ran
was an old stone wall
in that wall not far from the barn
in the greenery
he's half asleep
you are right
a chatty family of field mice had their home
their home
but the farmer's had moved away
the barn was abandoned
and the greenery stood empty
he's half asleep Fredrick
and since winter was not far off
the lil mice began to gather corn
and nuts and wheat and straw
and they all worked day and night
all except
Fredrick right
Fredrick why don't you work they asked
I do work said Fredrick
I gather sun rays
is Fredrick wiggling
you are wiggling
giggling
hehe hehe hehe
oh that's a wiggle alright
whoa
oh my gosh Fredrick is quite the wiggler
look what are the mice carrying
corn
and when they saw Fredrick sitting there
staring at the meadow they said and now Fredrick
I gather colors answered Fredrick
for winter is grey
that's a lot of colors
the phone is black
once Fredrick seemed half asleep
are you dreaming Fredrick they asked reproachfully
but Fredrick said oh no
I'm gathering words for the winter days are long and many
and we'll run out of things to say
the winter day wiggle
I caught Fredrick
Fredrick
the winter days came
is that the lil mouse tushie
what's his name I don't know
do you think we should come up with a name for him
let's see what if his name was what's a good name for a mouse
do you think
what about if his name was Harry
no
what if his name was Matthew
oh it's Steve okay
we'll call that we'll call that mouse Steve
and we can tell uncle Steve that there is a mouse named after him
that would be a good idea
winter days came and when the first snow fell the five lil field mice took to their hide out in the stones
is it snowing
oo did it snow here
we got a lot of snow a lil while ago
right
are they eating cookies
oh my goodness
in the beginning there was lots to eat
and the mouses told stories of foolish foxes and silly cats
and they were a happy family
but lil they nibbled up
that's Steve
oh boy
he doesn't look so so happy
I think he's hungry
I think that's Fredrick
oh gosh
who do you think that is
could that be Harvey
that's Harvey okay
and maybe that's Talula
right
and that could be
Mazy okay
good idea
can you remember what Fredrick said about sun rays
and colors and words
what about your supplies Fredrick
close your eyes said Fredrick
now I send you the rays of the sun
do you feel their golden glow
and then he told them of the blue periwinkles
and the red poppies
and the yellow wheat
and the green leaves on the berry bush
they saw the colors as clearly as they saw as if they had been painted in their minds
and the words Fredrick
Fredrick cleared his throat
waited a moment
and then as if from a stage
said wanna hear Fredrick's poem
who scatters the snowflakes
who melts the ice
who spoils the weather
who makes it nice
who grows the four leaf clover in June
who dims the day light
who lights the moon
four lil field mice who live in the sky
four lil field mice like you and I
one is the spring mouse who turns on the showers
then comes in the summer who paints in the flowers
the fall mouse is next with walnuts and wheat
and winter is last with lil cold feet
aren't we lucky the seasons are four
think of a year with one less or one more
when Fredrick had finished they all applauded
but Fredrick they said you are a poet
Fredrick blushed
and took a bow
and said I know it
I know that's how we made Fredrick
right
yeah
they put lil eyes and ears on Fredrick
those are his ears
and his tail
and his lil eyes and nose
and his tail too
hee hee hee hee
hee hee hee hee

you want mommy to go upstairs and get baby elephant
read the book first and then I'll get baby elephant
okay I'll get baby elephant
oh my gosh
where do you think baby elephant is
okay
I'll go get baby elephant
you think baby elephant needs to read Horton
because Horton's an elephant too
okay
you gonna sit with baby elephant
okay
Horton hatches the egg
sighed Mazy a lazy bird hatching an egg
I'm tired and I'm bored and I have kinks in my leg
from sitting just sitting here day after day
it's work how I hate it I'd much rather play
I'd take a vacation
fly off for a rest
if I could find someone to stay on my
nest
if I could fins someone I'd fly away free
then Horton the elephant passed by her tree
hello said the lazy bird smiling her best
she has a tail you are right
you are right Horton's got a tail too
right Horton's tail is white and Mazy's is red
wow
wow
hee hee hee
you have nothing to do and I do need a rest
would you like to sit on the egg on my nest
the elephant
oh did baby elephant fall down
and you fell down too
whoa
you are silly
I don't think it's so comfy to lie on your backpack right
and then I'll have to tickle you
yeah blankie likes to tickle you too
okay can we read our book and then go get blankie
no let's keep our sweater on sweetie
you with your pretty buttons
what color are your buttons
oy
should we finish Horton or should I put him away
alright
bye bye Horton
okay
the elephant laughed
of all silly things
I haven't feathers and I haven't wings
me on our egg
why that doesn't make sense
your egg is so small mam
and I'm so
immense
tut tut answered Mazy
I know you are not small
but I'm sure you can do it no trouble at all
just sit on it softly
you are gentle and kind
sweet stuff I'm not done with that page
do you want to finish the page
I can't said the elephant
please begged the bird
I won't be gone long I give you my word
I'll hurry right back I'll never be missed
very well said the elephant
since you insist
you want a vacation
go fly off and take it
I'll sit on your egg and try not to break it
hmm the first thing to do murmured Horton let's see
first thing to do is to prop up this tree
and make it much stronger that has to be done
before I get on I must weigh a
a ton
then Horton the elephant smiled
now that's that
and he sat and he sat and he sat and he sat
and sat all that day and kept the egg warm
it's raining
it's raining very hard isn't it
through a terrible storm
and it poured and it lightning
it thundered and rumbled
this isn't much fun the elephant grumbled
but Mazy by that time was far beyond reach
enjoying the sunshine way off in Palm Beach
and having such fun such a wonderful rest
decided she'd never go back to her nest
oh no
there's snow all over Horton
so Horton kept sitting there day after day
and soon it was autumn the leaves blew away
and then came the winter
the snow and the sleet
and the icicles hung from his trunk and his feet
so poor Horton sat there the whole winter through
he's all clean now
and then came spring time with troubles anew
his friends gathered round and shouted with glee
look Horton the elephant is up in a tree
they taunted and teased him and said how absurd
old Horton the elephant thinks he's a bird
no matter what happens this egg must be tended
but poor Horton
right
they are wearing suits
black eyes right
three hunters came up softly from behind
he heard the men's footsteps and turned with a start
three rifles were aiming right straight at his heart
did he run
he did not
Horton stayed on that nest
held his head high
and threw out his chest
and he looked at the hunters as much as to say
shoot if you must but I won't run away
but the men didn't shoot much to his surprise
they dropped their three guns and stared with wide eyes
hmm
and the first thing he knew they had built a big wagon
yeah that's one of the hunters
with ropes on front for the pullers to drag on
and dug up his tree and put it inside
with Horton so sad he practically cried
up out of the jungle up into the sky
up over the mountains
is that a baby elephant
oh
then down down the mountains and down into the sea went the cart and the elephant
with nest and tree
that's one of the hunters
he's pushing that cart
there's a fish
he's swimming you are right
he's swimming in the water you are right
Horton Horton is on a ship
right
right
red boat or a yellow boat
right
out of the wagon and onto a ship
over the ocean and oh what a trip
rolling and tossing and splash with the spray
and Horton said day after day after day
I meant what I said and I said what I meant
but oh am I sea sick
one hundred percent
after bobbing around two week on the port
they landed at last in the town of
New York
all a shore the men shouted and down with a lurch
and Horton the elephant still on his perch
tied on to a board that could just scarcely hold him
bump Horton landed and then the men sold him
my daddy works in Boston
he's selling tickets
he's selling tickets
those are red tickets
you buy a ticket and then your allowed to go into the show
then one day the circus show happened to reach a town way down south not far from Palm Beach
and dawdling along way up high in the sky
who of all people should chance to fly by
but that old good for nothing bird run away Mazy
still on vacation and still just as lazy
and she swooped from the clouds through an open tent door
good gracious gasped Mazy I've seen you before
poor Horton looked up with his face white as chalk
he started to speak but before he could talk
they rang out the noisiest ear splitting squeaks from the egg he had sat on for fifty one weeks
a thumping a bumping a wild alive scratching
my egg shouted Horton my egg
it's hatching
but it's mine screamed the bird
a baby is gonna come out of the egg
it's mice she sputtered you stole it from me
get off of my nest and out of my tree
poor Horton backed down with a sad heavy heart
there's the baby
but at that very instant the egg burst apart
the baby came out of the egg
and out of the pieces of red and white shell from the egg
there's the baby
it had ears and a tail and a trunk just like his
and the people came shouting what's all this about
and they looked and they stared ooh he's staring with his eyes popping out
oh that Mazy bird is mad
oh
it should be it should be it should be like that
because Horton was faithful he sat and he sat
he meant what he said
and said what I meant
and they sent him home happy
one hundred percent
