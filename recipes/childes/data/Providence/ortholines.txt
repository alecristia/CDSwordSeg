uhhuh he lost his button

and what did he find on the mattress
dyou remember
he found a button
and he pulled it off
there he is there's a picture of him
right
what's he doing
he lost his button yeah
Corduroy is a bear
who once lived in the toy department of a big store
day after day he waited with all the other animals and dolls for somebody to come along and take him home
what's there there's a giraffe and a doll
bunny rabbit and a
what's that
yeah it's a clown
the store was always full of shoppers buying all sort of things
but noone ever seemed to want a small bear in green overalls
then one morning a little girl stopped and looked straight into Corduroy's bright eyes
oh mommy she said look
there's the very bear I've always wanted
not today dear her mother sighed
I've spent too much already
besides he doesn't look new
he's lost the button to his overalls
Corduroy watched them sadly as they walked away
I didn't know I'd lost a button he said to himself
tonight I'll go and see if I can find it
what did he do
late that evening when all the shoppers had gone and the doors were shut and locked Corduroy climbed carefully down from his shelf and began searching everywhere on the floor for his lost button
uhoh what's that Ethan
an escalator
suddenly he felt the floor moving under him
quite by accident he had stepped on an escalator and up he went
could this be a mountain he wondered
I think I've always wanted to climb a mountain
is it a mountain Ethan
no what is it
yeah it's the escalator
he stepped off the escalator as it reached the next floor
and there before his eyes was a most amazing sight
tables and chairs and lamps and sofas
and rows and rows of
beds
this must be a palace Corduroy gasped
I guess I've always wanted to live in a palace
he wandered around admiring the furniture
Bob wants to read the story
this must be a bed he said
I've always wanted to sleep in a bed
and up he crawled onto the large thick mattress
all at once he saw something small and round
what did he think it was
hmm
what did he think it was
why there's my button he cried and he tried to pick it up
but like all the other buttons
on the mattress it was tied down tight
and then what happened Ethan
he yanked and pulled with both paws until
pop
off came the button and off the mattress Corduroy toppled
bang into a lamp
over it fell with a crash
yep there's Corduroy
Corduroy didn't know it but there was someone else awake in the store
the night watchman was going on his rounds on the floor above
when he heard the crash he came dashing down the escalator
now who in the world did that he said
somebody must be hiding around here
he flashed his light around sofas and beds until he came to the biggest bed of all
and there he saw two fuzzy brown ears sticking out from under the cover
who was it
who's that hiding
Corduroy
hello he said
how did you get upstairs
and the watchman tucked Corduroy under his arm and carried him down the escalator
and put him on a shelf in the toy department with all the other animals and dolls
what are they doing Ethan
they are sleeping that's right
Corduroy was just waking up when the first customers came into the store in the morning
there looking at him with a wide warm smile was the same girl
he'd seen only the day before
I'm Lisa she said and you are going to be my very own bear
last night I counted
mhm
I counted what I saved in my piggy bank
do you have a piggy bank too
yup it's upstairs
that's right
and it has lots of money in it
and my mother said I could bring you home
shall I put him in a box for you the sales lady asked
no thank you
no thank you said Lisa
and she carried Corduroy home in her arms
she ran all the way up four flights of stairs into her family's apartment and straight into her own room
Corduroy blinked
there was a chair
an a dresser
and next to a girl sized bed
what was next to a girl sized bed
yep that's right a little bed just for him
yup for me
this must be home he said
I know I've always wanted a home
Lisa sat down with Corduroy on her lap and began to sew a button on his overalls
I like you the way you are she said
but you'll be more comfortable with your shoulder strap fastened
you must be a friend said Corduroy
I've always wanted a friend

Scuffy the tugboat
who's looking down
mhm
Scuffy was sad
Scuffy was grumpy
Scuffy sniffed his blue smokestack
the toystore is no place for a red painted tugboat said Scuffy
he sniffed his blue smokestack again
I was meant for bigger things
he's in a toystore
perhaps you would not be grumpy if you went sailing said the man with the polka dot tie
there he is
who owned the toystore
so one night he took Scuffy home to his little boy
he filled the bathtub with water
sail little tugboat said the little boy
I won't sail in a bathtub said Scuffy
a tub is no place for a red painted tugboat
I was meant for bigger things
the next day the man with the polka dot tie and his little boy carried Scuffy to a river
sail little tugboat said the man with the polka dot tie
and what did he do Ethan
it was full of water
and Scuffy moved along quickly down the stream down the river
come back little tugboat come back
cried the little boy
not I tooted Scuffy not I
this is the life for me
he keeps going
all that day Scuffy sailed along with the stream
past cows and women washing clothes
Scuffy almost got hit by a cow
that was not fun
night came and the moon came out
there was nothing to see but the quiet trees
suddenly an owl called out
hoot hoot
toot toot
cried the little tugboat
he was scared
he wanted to see the man with the polka dot tie
the next morning Scuffy moved on
he saw two streams
to make a big river
Scuffy sailed down the river
he sailed past villages
he sailed past men with logs
what are they doing Ethan
they are gonna get the logs ready for the logging truck
this is a fine river said Scuffy but it's very busy and big for me
he sailed under some bridges
the river got deeper and wider and now there were big cities
and big boats
the river got deeper and deeper and deeper and it moved faster and faster
then it started to rain and Scuffy was riding on the waves
up and down
lots and lots and lots of rain
people had to bring cranes and put sand bags by the river
because the river was getting bigger and bigger and bigger and higher and higher and higher
and there's Scuffy all alone
on went the river to the sea
at last Scuffy sailed into a big city
here the river got wider and there were docks and wharves and big ships
it was a big noisy place
and cranes loaded freight onto some ships
Scuffy said toot toot
but nobody saw him the little tugboat
oh no said Scuffy when he saw the great big ocean
there's no beginning and no end to the sea
I wish I could find the man with the polka dot tie and
yup there's a red truck and what's that
yep it goes all the way to the dock
just then just as the little red tugboat sailed past the last piece of land a hand reached out
mm there's a lot of smoke coming out of those ships isn't there
that's Scuffy again
he's all by himself
but look who picked him up
who picked him up
the man with the polka dot tie and the little boy
and he said I wanna go home to the bathtub
that's just the right size for me
the end
there's Scuffy again yup
and there's the little red engine
little engine that could
I think I can
I think I can
a coal car yes he does
there's some coal
mhm Scuffy the tugboat

dizzy

Peter saw his dog Willie coming
quick as a wink
he hid in an empty box
lying on the sidewalk
wouldn't it be funny if I whistled Peter thought
Willie would stop and look all around to see who it was
Peter tried again to whistle
but still he couldn't
so Willie just walked on
Peter got out of the box and started home
on the way home he took some colored chalks out of his pocket and
drew a long long line
look at that
he drew it right around the girls jumping rope
and still he's drawing it
joop
joop
right up to his door
he stood there and tried to whistle again
he blew until his cheeks were tired but
nothing happened
he went into his house and put on his father's old hat
to make himself feel more grown up
he looked in then to the mirror to practice whistling
still no whistle
when his mother saw what he was doing
Peter pretended that he was his father
he said I've come home early today dear is Peter here
his mother answered
why no he's outside with Willie
well I'll go out and look for them said Peter
he's pretending to be his daddy
first he walked along a crack in the sidewalk
then he tried to run away from his shadow
there's his shadow
he jumped off his shadow
but when he landed
they were together again
he came to the corner where the box was and who should he see but
Willie
Peter scrambled under the box he blew
and blew
and
suddenly out came a real whistle
Willie stopped and looked around to see who it was

Harold decided to go for a walk in the
moonlight
there wasn't any moon

needed a moon oh
needed a moon for a walk in the moonlight
and he needed something to walk on
he made a long straight path so he wouldn't get lost
and he set off on his walk taking his big purple crayon with him
there it is
but he didn't seem to be getting anywhere on the long straight path
so he left the path for a shortcut across a field
and the moon went with him
the shortcut led right to where Harold thought a forest ought to be
he didn't want to get lost in the woods so he made a very small forest with
just one tree in it
that's right
it turned out to be an
yep
the apples would be very tasty Harold thought when they got red
so he put a
yep a frightening dragon under the tree to guard the apples
it was a terrible frightening dragon
it even frightened Harold he backed away
his hand holding the purple crayon
shook
yep
suddenly he realized
that's right your hands are shaking
that's right he's falling right into the water
by then Harold was over his head
in an ocean hmm
mhm
just like you were in the ocean the other day
he came up thinking fast
and
thinking fast and thinking big heh
he's thinking a lot yep
he has to think a lot because he has a lot of adventures so he has to
he has to
protect himself
and in no time at all he was climbing aboard a
a trim little boat
he quickly set sail
and the moon sailed along with him
mhm
and what did he draw
mhm
the sailboat
after he had sailed long enough Harold made land without much trouble
he stepped ashore on the beach
mhm
wondering where he was
where was he
right
the sandy beach reminded Harold of
yep picnics
and the thought of picnics made him hungry so he laid out a nice simple picnic lunch what was his lunch
yep lots of pies
there was nothing but pie
but they were all nine kinds of pie that Harold liked best
when Harold finished his picnic there was quite a lot left
he hated so to see so much pie go to waste so Harold left
mhm and a
yep the moose is gonna eat the pie up and what is the other animal he left
a porcupine a deserving porcupine to finish it up
and off he went looking for a hill to climb to see where he was
mhm a moose and a porcupine they are gonna finish up all the pie
Harold knew that the higher up he went the farther he could see
so he decided to make the hill into a
yep mountain
if he went high enough he thought he could see the window of his bedroom
he was tired and he felt he ought to be getting to bed
he hoped he could see his bedroom window from the top of the mountain
but what happened
as he looked down over the other side he
yep he slipped
and there wasn't any other side of the mountain he was falling in
thin air but luckily
right he kept his wits and his purple crayon
he made a balloon and he grabbed on to it
and he made a basket under the balloon big enough to stand in
he had a fine view from the balloon but he couldn't see his window
no I can see your window right over there right over there too
you have two windows in your bedroom
and usually the moon is
we can see the moon out that window
at night
he couldn't even see a house
so he made a house
with windows
two houses yup
and he landed the balloon on the grass in the front
looks like your house
none of the windows was his window
he tried to think where his window ought to be
he made some more windows
he made a big building full of windows
he made lots of buildings full of windows
he made a whole city full of windows
it does look like New York City and there's the moon it's still there
but none of the windows was his window
he couldn't think where it might be
yep
that's right
he decided to ask a policeman
the policeman pointed the way Harold was going anyway
but Harold thanked him
he followed the way
as he walked a
and he walked along with the moon wishing he was in his room and in bed
you gonna walk straight to your bed
then suddenly Harold remembered
he remembered where his bedroom window was when there was a moon
going to your bed
just like Harold did
the purple and brown book that's what color it is
mixed up
like your color and like your eyes are a little bit blue
and a little bit green
now this book is a lot brown and some purple
a different color purple
that's a color purple and that's a different color purple
he remembered where his bedroom window was when there was a moon it was always right around the moon
that's right
we are both wearing stripes Ethan
my shirt is stripy and your shirt is stripy
you wanna mix our shirts together
mix mix mix mix mix
and then we would have a new stripy shirt
and then Harold made his bed
he got in it
and he drew up the covers
the purple crayon dropped on the floor and Harold dropped off to sleep
year after year after year after year
ear after ear and year after year

Gus

and when Poppleton's mother visited she said that an icicle was surely going to
bonk him on the head
what
that's right
he has a ruler to measure them
but Poppleton didn't listen to any of them
he loved his icicles
every morning he took a ruler outside to see how much longer they had grown
a roller

they are building all kinds of buildings
most of the buildings don't have roofs yet
they need some roofs
so the trucks are working hard
to put the roofs on the buildings
where's that that one
the bigger one there we go
we might need some sand too
because they are going to build a play ground
hmm
where's
where are we gonna build the sandbox

there are lots of trees
so we'll clear some of these things out of the way
Harold's gonna help

my love for you is greater than all of these together
forever
huh fish eyes
if I could put on a suit of scales and some fins and one of these tails
I'd close my eyes and then I'd wish that I'd turn into a beautiful fish
I'd flip down rivers and splash in the sea
I'd swim so far you would never catch me
I'd see one green fish
two jumping fish
three smiling fish
four striped fish
five spotted fish
six fan tailed fish
seven flipping fish
eight skinny fish
nine flashy fish
ten darting fish
then I'd keep swimming until I would see
all of those fish eyes looking at me

we were very excited
Gespard and Lisa please stay out of trouble our teacher said
on the bus our teacher told us about some of the animal exhibits we would see
huh oh my gosh Lisa had been to the museum before and she said there was something even better
dinosaurs so big one of their footprints could make a swimming pool for us
we saw the butterflies the monkeys the tigers the elephants and even the scale of a whale
skeleton of a whale
but the exhibit of the extinct animals was the most exciting
Gespard and Lisa you look like the extinct animals
let's play a joke on our classmate said I said and we crept under the bars
our plan worked
our classmates took pictures of us lots of pictures
so perfectly that our class left without us the lights went out oh no

the only thing to eat was the dinosaur bones and they were sort of scary
grr we heard help we shouted

he does have a tail
wow
and where does Fredrick live
in the book
he does
where does Fredrick and his family live
do they live in the old stone wall
oh do we see an old stone wall while we were driving
we did
should we read Fredrick
all along the meadow
where the cows grazed and the horses ran
was an old stone wall
in that wall not far from the barn
in the greenery
he's half asleep
you are right
a chatty family of field mice had their home
their home
but the farmer's had moved away
the barn was abandoned
and the greenery stood empty
he's half asleep Fredrick
and since winter was not far off
the lil mice began to gather corn
and nuts and wheat and straw
and they all worked day and night
all except
Fredrick right
Fredrick why don't you work they asked
I do work said Fredrick
I gather sun rays
is Fredrick wiggling
you are wiggling
giggling
hehe hehe hehe
oh that's a wiggle alright
whoa
oh my gosh Fredrick is quite the wiggler
look what are the mice carrying
corn
and when they saw Fredrick sitting there
staring at the meadow they said and now Fredrick
I gather colors answered Fredrick
for winter is grey
that's a lot of colors
the phone is black
once Fredrick seemed half asleep
are you dreaming Fredrick they asked reproachfully
but Fredrick said oh no
I'm gathering words for the winter days are long and many
and we'll run out of things to say
the winter day wiggle
I caught Fredrick
Fredrick
the winter days came
is that the lil mouse tushie
what's his name I don't know
do you think we should come up with a name for him
let's see what if his name was what's a good name for a mouse
do you think
what about if his name was Harry
no
what if his name was Matthew
oh it's Steve okay
we'll call that we'll call that mouse Steve
and we can tell uncle Steve that there is a mouse named after him
that would be a good idea
winter days came and when the first snow fell the five lil field mice took to their hide out in the stones
is it snowing
oo did it snow here
we got a lot of snow a lil while ago
right
are they eating cookies
oh my goodness
in the beginning there was lots to eat
and the mouses told stories of foolish foxes and silly cats
and they were a happy family
but lil they nibbled up
that's Steve
oh boy
he doesn't look so so happy
I think he's hungry
I think that's Fredrick
oh gosh
who do you think that is
could that be Harvey
that's Harvey okay
and maybe that's Talula
right
and that could be
Mazy okay
good idea
can you remember what Fredrick said about sun rays
and colors and words
what about your supplies Fredrick
close your eyes said Fredrick
now I send you the rays of the sun
do you feel their golden glow
and then he told them of the blue periwinkles
and the red poppies
and the yellow wheat
and the green leaves on the berry bush
they saw the colors as clearly as they saw as if they had been painted in their minds
and the words Fredrick
Fredrick cleared his throat
waited a moment
and then as if from a stage
said wanna hear Fredrick's poem
who scatters the snowflakes
who melts the ice
who spoils the weather
who makes it nice
who grows the four leaf clover in June
who dims the day light
who lights the moon
four lil field mice who live in the sky
four lil field mice like you and I
one is the spring mouse who turns on the showers
then comes in the summer who paints in the flowers
the fall mouse is next with walnuts and wheat
and winter is last with lil cold feet
aren't we lucky the seasons are four
think of a year with one less or one more
when Fredrick had finished they all applauded
but Fredrick they said you are a poet
Fredrick blushed
and took a bow
and said I know it
I know that's how we made Fredrick
right
yeah
they put lil eyes and ears on Fredrick
those are his ears
and his tail
and his lil eyes and nose
and his tail too
hee hee hee hee

you want mommy to go upstairs and get baby elephant
read the book first and then I'll get baby elephant
okay I'll get baby elephant
oh my gosh
where do you think baby elephant is
okay
I'll go get baby elephant
you think baby elephant needs to read Horton
because Horton's an elephant too
okay
you gonna sit with baby elephant
okay
Horton hatches the egg
sighed Mazy a lazy bird hatching an egg
I'm tired and I'm bored and I have kinks in my leg
from sitting just sitting here day after day
it's work how I hate it I'd much rather play
I'd take a vacation
fly off for a rest
if I could find someone to stay on my
nest
if I could fins someone I'd fly away free
then Horton the elephant passed by her tree
hello said the lazy bird smiling her best
she has a tail you are right
you are right Horton's got a tail too
right Horton's tail is white and Mazy's is red
wow
wow
hee hee hee
you have nothing to do and I do need a rest
would you like to sit on the egg on my nest
the elephant
oh did baby elephant fall down
and you fell down too
whoa
you are silly
I don't think it's so comfy to lie on your backpack right
and then I'll have to tickle you
yeah blankie likes to tickle you too
okay can we read our book and then go get blankie
no let's keep our sweater on sweetie
you with your pretty buttons
what color are your buttons
oy
should we finish Horton or should I put him away
alright
bye bye Horton
okay
the elephant laughed
of all silly things
I haven't feathers and I haven't wings
me on our egg
why that doesn't make sense
your egg is so small mam
and I'm so
immense
tut tut answered Mazy
I know you are not small
but I'm sure you can do it no trouble at all
just sit on it softly
you are gentle and kind
sweet stuff I'm not done with that page
do you want to finish the page
I can't said the elephant
please begged the bird
I won't be gone long I give you my word
I'll hurry right back I'll never be missed
very well said the elephant
since you insist
you want a vacation
go fly off and take it
I'll sit on your egg and try not to break it
hmm the first thing to do murmured Horton let's see
first thing to do is to prop up this tree
and make it much stronger that has to be done
before I get on I must weigh a
a ton
then Horton the elephant smiled
now that's that
and he sat and he sat and he sat and he sat
and sat all that day and kept the egg warm
it's raining
it's raining very hard isn't it
through a terrible storm
and it poured and it lightning
it thundered and rumbled
this isn't much fun the elephant grumbled
but Mazy by that time was far beyond reach
enjoying the sunshine way off in Palm Beach
and having such fun such a wonderful rest
decided she'd never go back to her nest
oh no
there's snow all over Horton
so Horton kept sitting there day after day
and soon it was autumn the leaves blew away
and then came the winter
the snow and the sleet
and the icicles hung from his trunk and his feet
so poor Horton sat there the whole winter through
he's all clean now
and then came spring time with troubles anew
his friends gathered round and shouted with glee
look Horton the elephant is up in a tree
they taunted and teased him and said how absurd
old Horton the elephant thinks he's a bird
no matter what happens this egg must be tended
but poor Horton
right
they are wearing suits
black eyes right
three hunters came up softly from behind
he heard the men's footsteps and turned with a start
three rifles were aiming right straight at his heart
did he run
he did not
Horton stayed on that nest
held his head high
and threw out his chest
and he looked at the hunters as much as to say
shoot if you must but I won't run away
but the men didn't shoot much to his surprise
they dropped their three guns and stared with wide eyes
hmm
and the first thing he knew they had built a big wagon
yeah that's one of the hunters
with ropes on front for the pullers to drag on
and dug up his tree and put it inside
with Horton so sad he practically cried
up out of the jungle up into the sky
up over the mountains
is that a baby elephant
oh
then down down the mountains and down into the sea went the cart and the elephant
with nest and tree
that's one of the hunters
he's pushing that cart
there's a fish
he's swimming you are right
he's swimming in the water you are right
Horton Horton is on a ship
right
right
red boat or a yellow boat
right
out of the wagon and onto a ship
over the ocean and oh what a trip
rolling and tossing and splash with the spray
and Horton said day after day after day
I meant what I said and I said what I meant
but oh am I sea sick
one hundred percent
after bobbing around two week on the port
they landed at last in the town of
New York
all a shore the men shouted and down with a lurch
and Horton the elephant still on his perch
tied on to a board that could just scarcely hold him
bump Horton landed and then the men sold him
my daddy works in Boston
he's selling tickets
he's selling tickets
those are red tickets
you buy a ticket and then your allowed to go into the show
then one day the circus show happened to reach a town way down south not far from Palm Beach
and dawdling along way up high in the sky
who of all people should chance to fly by
but that old good for nothing bird run away Mazy
still on vacation and still just as lazy
and she swooped from the clouds through an open tent door
good gracious gasped Mazy I've seen you before
poor Horton looked up with his face white as chalk
he started to speak but before he could talk
they rang out the noisiest ear splitting squeaks from the egg he had sat on for fifty one weeks
a thumping a bumping a wild alive scratching
my egg shouted Horton my egg
it's hatching
but it's mine screamed the bird
a baby is gonna come out of the egg
it's mice she sputtered you stole it from me
get off of my nest and out of my tree
poor Horton backed down with a sad heavy heart
there's the baby
but at that very instant the egg burst apart
the baby came out of the egg
and out of the pieces of red and white shell from the egg
there's the baby
it had ears and a tail and a trunk just like his
and the people came shouting what's all this about
and they looked and they stared ooh he's staring with his eyes popping out
oh that Mazy bird is mad
oh
it should be it should be it should be like that
because Horton was faithful he sat and he sat
he meant what he said
and said what I meant
and they sent him home happy
one hundred percent

little miss spider popped pout of her egg
swinging down from a thread she hung on by one leg
watching brothers and sisters all scooting for cover
she dangled there wondering where is my mother
did she squeeze down a hole or dive under water
why won't she come out here and meet her new daughter
she climbed to the tippy top of a tree
gazing out on the world she sobbed where can mom be
a beetle named Betty buzzed by this high perch
a child needs a mother may I please help you search
that's beetle Betty
I don't know for sure but
yeah I don't know for but she doesn't know that
I don't know for sure but I'll offer this clue if I were your mother I'd be looking for you
they flew through the trees spying down from the sky
and asked all the butterflies fluttering by
but none of the insects they happened upon had any idea where her mother had gone
that is a lady bug
she then asked a small spider as plump as a pig
have you seen my mom she's like me only big
the sly spider laughed
that is a spider
as he gobbled his snack
up there is a mother who's yellow and black
with a heart full of joy she peered over the straw
but it wasn't her mother that miss spider saw
it was six hungry hatchlings and a goldfinch who cried
your dinner is here darlings so open up wide
yikes
oh they think miss spider is their dinner
before she could
she was whisked out of sight and Brave Bittle Brave Beetle Betty was hugging her tight
oh goodness
Betty saved her
in her warm cozy home
she did
in her warm cozy home in the bark of a tree
the kind beetle asked won't you stay here with me
then miss
then miss spider smiled and held Betty fast
I looked for my mom and I found you at last
for finding your mother there's one certain test
you must look for the creature who loves you the
best

I'd take a vacation fly off for a rest
if I could find someone to stay on my nest
if I could find someone I'd fly away free
do you wanna read Chester's way instead
okay
Chester's way
Chester had his own way of doing things
he always cut his sandwiches diagonally
he always got out of bed on the same side
and he never left the house without double knotting his shoes
Chester always had the same thing for breakfast
toast with jam and peanut butter
and he always carried a miniature first aid kit in his back pocket
just in case
you definitely have a mind of your own said Chester's mother
that's one way to put it said Chester's father
Chester's best friend Wilson was exactly the same way
that's why they were best friends
Chester wouldn't play baseball unless Wilson played and they never swung at the first pitch or slid head first
Wilson wouldn't ride his bicycle unless Chester wanted to and they always used hand signals
if Chester was hungry Wilson was to
but they rarely ate between meals
some days I can't tell those two apart said Wilson's mother
me either said Wilson's father
Chester and Wilson Wilson and Chester
that's the way it was
they loved to go on picnics
once when Wilson accidentally swallowed a watermelon seed and cried because he was afraid a watermelon plant would grow inside him
Chester swallowed one to
don't worry said Chester if you grow a watermelon plant I'll grow one to
Chester duplicated his Christmas list every year and gave a copy to Wilson because they always wanted to same things anyway
for Halloween they would always dress as things that went together
salt and pepper shakers two mittens on a string
ham and eggs
they really are two peas in a pod said Chester's mother
looks like it Chester's father
in spring Chester and Wilson shared the same umbrella
in winter they never threw snowballs at each other
in fall they raked leaves together
and in summer they reminded each other to wear sun screen to they wouldn't burn
Chester and Wilson Wilson and Chester
that's the way it was
and then Lily moved into the neighborhood
Lily had her own way of doing things
let's not hurt your teeth okay honey
she wore bandaids all over her arms and legs to look brave
she talked backwards to herself sometimes so no one would know what she was saying
and she never left the house without one of her nifty disguises
Lily waved at all the cars that passed by even if she didn't know who was in them
and she always carried a loaded squirt gun in her back pocket just in case
she definitely has a mind of her own said Chester
that's one way to put it said Wilson
when Lily asked Chester and Wilson to play they said they were busy
when she called them at home they disguised their voices and said they weren't home
if Lily was walking on one side of the street Chester and Wilson crossed to the other side and hid
she's something else said Chester
looks like it said Wilson
one day when Chester and Wilson were practicing their hand signals
some older boys rode by
well those are some older boys who rode by and they circled
well that's an older boy and he's not very nice
that's Wilson and Chester
and that's an older boy
and that's an older boy
Chester and Wilson didn't know what to do
right
Chester and Wilson didn't know what to do
just when they were about to give up hope a fierce looking cat with horrible fangs jumped out of the bushes and frightened the older boys away
are you who I think you are Chester asked the cat
of course the cat replied
thank you Lily said Chester
thank you cat
you are welcome Chester said Lily
thank you Lily said Wilson
right
she was
you are welcome Wilson said Lily
I'm glad you were wearing a disguise said Chester
and I'm glad you had your squirt gun said Wilson
I always do said Lily
just in case
afterward Chester invited Lily over for lunch
you have a muscle mouse cup said Lily
of course said Chester
I do too
right there see he's holding his cup
oh her her cup must be at her house
Chester and Wilson cut their sandwiches diagonally
Lily asked Chester's mother if she had cookie cutters and she made stars and flowers and bells
mhm
and a flower right
is that a flower shape sort of
right
right
mhm
right
that night Lily invited Chester and Wilson to sleep over
you have a night light said Chester
of course said Lily
right there
wow
Chester and Wilson wanted toast with jam and peanut butter for breakfast the next morning
boring said Lily
try this instead
wow this is good said Chester
wow said Wilson
after that when Lily asked Chester and Wilson to play they said yes
right
that's right
sometimes I can't tell these three apart said Lily's mother
me either said Lily's father
Chester and Wilson and Lily Lily and Wilson and Chester
that's the way it was
right right
drums
you are right
you are right
Chester has a purple balloon
Wilson has a pink balloon and a drum
Lily has a broom
you are absolutely right
for Halloween they dressed as the three blind mice
for Christmas Lily gave Chester and Wilson nifty disguises
well I think this is Chester because he's brown
this is Lily because she's white
and this is Wilson because he's grey
right right Chester right Chester is wearing one of Lily's boots
and Wilson is wearing the other one of Lily's boots
you have a drippy lollie
right a big picture
in spring Chester Wilson and Lily shared the same umbrella
in winter they never threw snowballs at each other
in fall they raked leaves together
and in summer they reminded each other to wear sun screen so they wouldn't burn
Chester and Wilson and Lily
Lily and Wilson and Chester

my teacher called an ambulance
and the ambulance people put me on a stretcher
they asked me what happened but I still didn't want to tell
well his name is Mike
and I think his name is Joe
think so
yeah
it was a little hard to explain why I put a key chain in my mouth
they took me to the hospital
I had a big room all to myself
the nurse took off my white scarf and put a white gown on me
don't worry she said we'll take good care of you
it won't hurt
but I was still a little scared
especially when she took me to the x ray room
he's a little bit scared
looking for him
and there he was
hi she said I'm Isabelle
and I'm Vik he told her
Isabelle and Vik had lots of fun together
Isabelle told silly stories and Vik whistled like a bird
he knew how to cross his eyes too
I wish I could do that Isabelle said laughing
then Vik said let's go to Rhino city and you can meet all of my friends
in Rhino city everyone stared at Isabelle
they whispered to each other an elephant in Rhino city
how very strange
lady Rataxes was terribly angry
you cannot be friends with that little elephant she told her son
king Rataxes ordered Isabelle to leave at once
and don't come back
we don't like elephants in Rhino city he shouted
Isabelle walked back to Celeste Ville
she felt so sad
would she ever see her new friend again
Vik was unhappy too
the very next day he snuck out of Rhino city to look for Isabelle

Missus Heavy Bottom gave them towels
Isabelle pretended hers was a long flowing gown
I am the queen she told Vik
and I must be King said Vik

one morning Ariel the Little Mermaid went looking for hidden treasure with her best friend
Flounder
Ariel was supposed to sing for the first time in front of her father king Triton and all the other mer people
but for now she was much more interested in sunken ships than her father's concert
while they were searching Flounder began to get nervous
what was that he said
did you hear something
suddenly a very large
shark smashed through the side of the ship
swim a shark Flounder cried
they swam away very quickly
Ariel and Flounder found a safe spot where the shark couldn't reach them
you big bully Flounder shouted at the shark
as soon as she was sure they were a safe distance from the shark Ariel thanked Flounder for being so brave
even though he was a very small fish he had a very big heart and he was Ariel's best friend under the sea
after their adventure Ariel and Flounder headed home hoping that they would not be too late for her father's concert
ooh it's a big concert
what's the octopus playing
right
and what's Sebastian doing
what is he
he's the conductor and he's conducting the orchestra
and these fish are all playing horns
and what does she have on her head
feathers on her head wow
that's great
yeah she looks like she has sort of little feathers on her head too
and who is that
that's Ariel's daddy
she looks like she has the seashell on her head
right

Cinderella
what's the story called
The Dance lesson
just imagine said Cinderella excitedly there's a ball at the palace tonight in honor of the prince and every maiden in the land is invited
that means me too
all of Cinderella's friends clapped and chirped as they gathered around
they loved their Cinderellee
oh dear said Cinderella with a sigh there's so much to do
I can only go if I've finished my chores and today Stepmother has given me more work than ever
there's washing mending ironing cooking scrubbing sweeping
suddenly three loud shrieks came from downstairs
Cinderella come down here immediately and help us get ready for the ball her stepsisters cried
her cruel stepmother and stepsisters wouldn't give poor Cinderella any time to do the rest of her chores
mend my dress screeched Anastasia
polish my shoes whined Rosella
iron my cloak demanded her stepmother
are they nice
no they are not so nice
but is Cinderella nice
she's nice
and are Cinderella's friends nice
yes
hours later Cinderella began to sweep and scrub the endless stone floor
suddenly Jack had an idea
I know he said
we'll help Cinderella
all the other mice nodded in agreement
what would I do without you she said patting each of them on the head
you are so good to me
everyone joined in the cleaning singing happily as they went
as she worked Cinderella began to imagine the magical evening ahead
everyone would be dressed in the finest clothes and Cinderella would wear her mother's beautiful gown
the ballroom would come alive with music dancing and laughter and the prince would bow before Cinderella and ask her to dance
suddenly Cinderella stopped dreaming
oh no she cried I've never been to a ball
I don't even know how to dance
dontchu worry Cinderella Jacques smiled reassuringly
we'll show you how to dance easy as pie
with that Jack bowed before Perla and extended his hand
dance please Missy he asked
Perla blushed as she took Jack's hand
Gus was the conductor and he got all the birds to sing
Jack and Perla spun round and around gliding across the floor
Cinderella watched and copied their movements
just listen and move see said Perla
not so scary
using her broom as an imaginary partner Cinderella danced and twirled gracefully through the room
she led everyone across the floor sweeping and cleaning as they went
good Cinderella said Jack beaming
lucky prince gets to dance with Cinderellee
the mice collapsed on the floor laughing
lets
oh there's Ariel
a Special surprise
the underwater kingdom was quiet and peaceful
every mermaid and merman was in bed fast asleep
everyone except princess Ariel and her friend Flounder
hurry up Flounder cried Ariel
it's almost time for the party
we can't be late
trying not to make sound Ariel and Flounder swam away from king Triton's palace
they began their journey toward the surface
but Ariel said Flounder are you sure we should go to the surface
remember last time
your father got so angry
you know how he feels about humans
that's right this time we can't get caught said Ariel
she wasn't to let anything ruin her plans for tonight
prince Eric the prince Ariel had saved in a shipwreck was having a royal ball
and Ariel had a very special surprise for him
swim faster Flounder she cried glancing back at him
and Flounder raced to catch up
just as Ariel and Flounder approached the surface Ariel saw beautiful lights dance across the water
I don't think anyone's wearing yellow there are they
no
what do you think's happening
well I guess prince Eric is out on the balcony
he just didn't feel like joining in the royal celebration
he could
Melody is crying
yeah
did Melody
when they had the party for Melody she didn't wanna be at the party either did she
she just wanted to go swimming right
yeah
she went back in the sea again
yeah
she was happy there right
did she go with Sebastian
yeah
Sebastian fell in the water again
yeah
prince Eric stood on the palace balcony
he couldn't stop thinking about the mysterious girl with the lovely voice who had saved his life
Flounder spotted the prince first
look Ariel he said pointing a fin at the castle
Ariel's heart leapt with joy when she saw Prince Eric
it's time for my surprise she said winking at Flounder
swimming up to a nearby rock Ariel and Flounder hid behind it
ready asked Flounder
with a nod Ariel closed her eyes opened her mouth and began to sing
suddenly the night was filled with the sweet sound of Ariel's voice
she sang a song she had written just for Eric
it was Ariel's special gift for him
hearing her beautiful voice again Eric's face lit up
it can't be he said
I must be hearing the sounds of the wind
still he remained on the balcony enchanted by the beautiful song
when the song was over Eric looked out across the sea
he hoped to catch a glimpse of the wonderful girl who had saved him
who are you he called out into the night
but all he heard was the echo of his own voice
I'll be back soon Ariel whispered as she and Flounder swam toward home

what's Corduroy looking for
I donno
tadah
tadah
tadah
oh my gosh what do you say
you are welcome
please
hmm
what's this book about
Corduroy
is Corduroy a little bear
what's he wearing
is he wearing overalls
yes
what color are they
oh
late one summer afternoon Lisa and her mother took their laundry to the laundromat
as always on such trips Lisa took along her toy bear Corduroy
a laundromat was a busy place at this hour
now Corduroy you sit right here and wait for me Lisa said
I'm going to help with our wash
Corduroy waited patiently then he suddenly perked up his ears
Lisa's mother was saying be sure to take everything out of your pockets Lisa dear
you don't want your precious things to get all wet and soapy
pockets said Corduroy to himself
I don't have a pocket
he slid off the chair
I must go find something to make a pocket out of he said and he began to look around
first he came to a pile of fancy towels and wash cloths but nothing was the right size or color
then he saw a huge stack of colorful clothes in a laundry basket
there ought to be something in there to make a pocket out of he said
without hesitating he climbed inside the bag which was filled with pieces of wet laundry
the dampness didn't bother Corduroy in the least
this must be a cave he said sighing happily
I've always wanted to live in a dark cool cave
when the time came for Lisa to fetch her bear he was gone
oh Mommy she said Corduroy isn't here where I left him
I'm sorry Honey said her mother but the Laundromat will be closing soon and we must be getting home
Lisa was reluctant to leave without Corduroy but her mother insisted
you can come back tomorrow she said
I'm sure he will still be here
as they left a young man wearing an artist's beret was taking his wet laundry out of a bag a very bad Corduroy had discovered
before he knew it Corduroy was being tossed together with all the sheets and shirts and shorts and slacks
into the dryer
but just as the artist was shutting the glass door Corduroy tumbled out onto the floor
how in thunder did that bear ever get mixed up with my things the artist wondered
poor Corduroy was damp all over
the least I can do for him is give his overalls a good drying said the man thoughtfully
he unbuttoned Corduroy's shoulder straps and put his overalls in the dryer
Corduroy grew dizzy as he watched the clothes spinning round but the artist became inspired
this would make a wonderful painting he said as he took out his sketch pad and began drawing the swirling colors
I can hardly wait to get back to my studio
finally the dryer stopped whirling and the man gathered up the clothes
and he helped Corduroy put on his warm dry overalls
all at once the manager of the laundromat called closing time everybody out
Corduroy was gently placed on top of a washing machine
I wonder who that bear belongs to said the artist as he was leaving
it seems to me he should have his name someplace
he's too fine a fellow to be lost
as soon as the lights were turned off Corduroy began searching
began his search again
he was surprised to see something white glowing in the dark
what is it
maybe it's snow he said
I've always wanted to play in the snow
he accidentally tipped over the open lidded box and suddenly he was covered in soft slippery soap flakes
it's soap
gradually Corduroy began to slip and slide
what fun he said with a smile
I've always wanted to ski down a steep mountainside
he landed paws first in an empty laundry basket
this must be a cage he said
I've never wanted to live inside a cage
but by now Corduroy was drowsy and soon he nodded off to
oh he's sleeping
next morning when the manager came to open the door of the laundromat Lisa was waiting
I left something here yesterday she said
may I look around
certainly said the manager
my customers are always leaving things
Lisa was searching under the chairs and in back of the washing machines when he
when he
when she heard the manager call her
is this whatchor looking for
yes he's my best friend shouted Lisa as she came running
she reached in and picked Corduroy out of the basket
so this is where you've been you little rascal she said
it's time I took you home
Lisa thanked the manager and ran out of the door down the street holding Corduroy tightly in her arms
why did you wander away she said
I went looking for a pocket said Corduroy
oh Corduroy why didn't you tell me you wanted a pocket asked Lisa giving him an affectionate squeeze
the very next morning Lisa sewed a pocket on Corduroy's overalls
and here's a card I've made with your name on it for you to keep tucked inside
that's his little pocket
I've always wanted a purple pocket with my name inside said Corduroy as he and Lisa nuzzled noses
that's some thread
that Lisa used to sew the pocket on
wow
that's great
well you want Mommy to pick it out
oh you wanna pick it out
okay
you have to carry your box
you want me to hold your milk
okay
what would be a good book to read

okay Franklin's class trip
Franklin could count by twos and tie his shoes
he had gone with his class to the bakery the fire station and the pet store
today Franklin's class was going to the museum
Franklin was so excited that he could hardly eat his breakfast
the museum had lots of steps and huge doors
wow said Franklin it's big
it has to be said Beaver there are real dinosaurs in there
do you remember in New York we went with grandma and grandpa to the museum with the dinosaurs
yeah that's called the museum of natural history in New York
Beaver had been to the museum before she knew everything about it
big dinosaurs she emphasized
so big that they ate trees for breakfast
Franklin was afraid to ask what dinosaurs ate for lunch
Franklin sat down on the steps
what's wrong asked Snail
Beaver says there are real dinosaurs in the museum
Snail looked alarmed
that sounds scary
and Franklin nodded
we are not gonna get that
in the museum lobby Mister Owl went over the rules
no shouting no running and stay with the group
Mister Owl said Beaver one more thing
watch out for the dinosaurs
Moose and Bear laughed
but Franklin didn't he moved a little closer to Mister Owl
their first stop was the bat cave
it was dark inside
squeaks and squawks filled the air
what's that asked Franklin
Beaver giggled
that's the sound bats make to find their way around
Franklin was relieved that it was bats and not dinosaurs
the class visited the rainforest next
Franklin climbed high into a tree house
he could see the tops of trees
can you spot any dinosaurs asked Snail
Franklin shook his head and climbed down quickly
there was so much to do in the museum that Franklin almost forgot about the dinosaurs
in the medieval room Franklin had fun dressing up like a knight
we saw knights in the other museum in New York at the Metropolitan right
yeah
Franklin even got to dig in a sandy pit
he was the first one to find an arrow head
it was just like being a real archaeologist
wow that's neat
an archaeologist is when you dig in the sand for very old things
yeah
the best part is still to come said Beaver as they sat down in the cafeteria
yes agreed Bear lunch
Mister Owl smiled I think Beaver means the dinosaur exhibit
Franklin gulped I'm too tired to see more I think I'll stay here a while he muttered
me too said Snail
you'll forget about being tired when you see the dinosaurs said Mister Owl
eat up and let's go
reluctantly Franklin and Snail followed the giant footprints down a long leafy corridor
there was a loud roar
the floor shook and so did Franklin
ah
screamed Franklin when he turned the corner
he was looking right into the bony mouth of a tyrannosaurus
Franklin blinked
they are bones
real dinosaur bones
but the dinosaurs aren't even alive
alive giggled Beaver of course not
there hasn't been a live dinosaur for millions of years
you sure make good jokes Franklin
you sure do said Snail
as they were leaving Franklin and his friends walked past the egyptian
the egyptian exhibit
next time said Beaver you should visit the tomb there's a mummy inside
is it real asked Franklin
yeah and it's scary said Beaver
but Franklin wasn't scared
he had a mummy at home
and he hardly could hardly wait to tell her all about his adventures at the museum
yay
can I try one of your cherries
are they good
tasty
sure I can
let's see what we have
let's try these
Auntie gave us these books too and I don't think we've read them yet
Maisy

Maisy runs downstairs to see who it is who do you think's at the door

Maisy runs back upstairs and gets undressed

Tallulah runs up to the bathroom and takes off her clothes
splash splash Maisy and Tallulah play in the tub

Maisy's bedtime
Maisy is sleepy it's time for bed
it's bedtime for Panda too
Maisy closes her bedroom curtains hoots the owl
Maisy washes her face and brushes her teeth
Maisy puts on her pajamas
Maisy gets into bed and reads a story
but where is Panda
is he in the toy box
oh there he is behind the curtain
Maisy turns off the light
but she still isn't ready to go to sleep
hmm
she forgot to use the potty
wow
Panda sits on his potty too
look at that
she's using the potty
and she wears big girl underpants
wow
Maisy's very sleepy now
good night Maisy
good night Panda
that's great
there's the last page with all the pictures
terrific
should we read this
I'll teach my dog one hundred words
you wanna see the
oh fruits and nuts
in late summer and fall trees produce seeds
some come in nuts others
alright you wanna do the cobweb cake
okay hello fruity crumble yummy
fall leaves
okay well Honey I start reading and then you don't like that page maybe oh
mushroom hunt
early fall is the best time to go I didn't know this Honey
early fall is the best time to go hunting for toadstools and mushrooms
we should tell Daddy that
you can find an astonishing variety in fields and forests and even in gardens
toadstools and mushrooms are fungi
these are plants that don't have any leaves or flowers but send tiny threads down into other plants or animal other plants or animal dung and feed on them
some fungi grow on dead leaves and others grow on tree trunks or dead logs
here are some to look for
cepes@sfra
also known as the porcini I believe
has a dark brown cap with pores underneath instead of gills
ooh this is a poisonous one we are not allowed to eat that one
let's see which ones look like the ones that we see
look at that giant puff ball
it's a giant puff ball mushroom
that's very funny
Dryad's Saddle has a pale yellow brown cap with darker scales
and a crimson wax cap is red
that's a honey fungus mushroom
yeah ooh this mushroom is called a stink horn and it has a nasty strong smell P U
yeah
yeah you could
yeah
yeah look at those and these are called Chanterelle mushrooms
mm this is called a parasol
because it looks like an umbrella
Sweetie can you eat some of your
cinnamon toast
look this is all about spiders Honey
uhhuh
is that tasty
uhhuh
the best time to see spiders' webs is early on a fall morning when their fragile threads are strung with beads of dew or mist
spiders spin webs to catch insects
different spiders have different types of webs
hmm
they don't look so nice you don't think
they do
do the spiders look very nice
pretty nice
how small
yeah
that spider's trying to eat that bug
don't ya think
how spiders spin sheet webs in the corners of rooms
you are right
you are right
does that look like a mushroom that might be a spider hiding
planting
mhm
many spring flowers grow from bulbs but you have to plant them in the fall eight to twelve weeks beforehand
you can plant them in a garden or in pots
you can also plant them in indoor pots as long as you keep them in a cool dark place for two to three months
indoor bulbs flower earlier than outdoor ones because it is warmer inside
hmm pretty
chocolate cobweb cake
make this delicious cake for a fall party or celebration
it is very easy
yeah a little spider
all of the ingredients are mixed together in the same bowl
that looks good doesn't it
mhm
yummy
you know what that is
chocolate right
that is a chocolate cake
yummy
yummy
as the days grow shorter and colder in the fall some birds and animals leave their summer homes and travel great distances to spend the winter
oh a butterfly how pretty that's called a monarch butterfly
look at that funny bird
oh that's a swallow
that little bird
and this is a hoopoe apparently
well some birds and animals leave their summer homes and travel great distances to spend the winter in warmer lands where there's plenty of food this is called migration
that means when it gets cold out Honey the birds fly south to the warm weather that's called migration
neat huh
mhm
preparing for winter
in the fall wherever you live you may find signs of birds and animals getting ready for the winter
many of them stock up on food before it becomes scarce and others are preparing shelters or homes to keep them warm and safe for the winter
squirrels bury nuts in the fall
any nuts that a squirrel forgets about may sprout and grow into trees
oh look at that
I'm not sure what kind of butterfly it is but it's pretty huh
yeah
there's the stars at night
these star maps will help you identify the constellations that you can see in the night sky in the winter
the best time to use the maps is at around eleven P M on a clear night away from city lights
you know Mommy and Daddy grew up in the city and we never saw any stars because there were so many lights in the city
but the stars look pretty here
and one day when you were a little tiny baby Mommy and Daddy got you up in the middle of the night and took you out to a play ground to look at the stars at night
I think there were some shooting stars or something like that
but we bundled you up and you were nice and warm
yes I can
hello
winter weather
in most parts of the winter winter is colder than other seasons
the days are shorter and the nights are longer
in countries where the temperature drops below freezing point for much of the winter there is a lot of frost and snow
and some places there may be snow on the ground for several months
hmm
this is neat this says how to make a snow shaker
yeah that's very neat
stormy skies
water colors are very good for painting moody skies and clouds
especially if you wet the paper first
before you start a picture try some of the ideas shown below to find out how to create different effects
wow
look at this you can make clouds
oh how pretty
ooh and there's a castle
and stormy stormy air
winter buds
in the winter trees hardly grow at all but slow down and rest
oh
I think it's a tree actually with a little bud
see
is that neat
all these look at all these different little sticks with things growing on them huh
let's see if we can find our tree in the back
our tree's a red oak tree
I don't see any oaks here
here's sort of
sort of like ours
yeah
let's see
that's right
look at all those beautiful green leaves
that's an oak leaf
that's like what falls from our tree
this one
that's brown and then these are green right
winter trees
trees that lose their leaves in winter are called deciduous trees
well you learn something every day huh
almost all of them have broad flat leaves
deciduous trees lose their leaves each fall and grow new ones in the following spring
do all the leaves fall to the ground and we rake them up into big piles
or Manny rakes them up for us because he's better at it than we are
winter flowers oh look at all
few plants flower in the winter because frost and ice harm them but toward the end of the winter when it starts to get warmer the first flowers appeal
look for them in sheltered spots in gardens parks and woodlands
the crocus sometimes we see little crocus flowers here
when winter is over
camellias those are pretty huh
they do look like roses they do
baked potatoes
yummy
oh those are tomatoes you are right those are tomatoes and these are potatoes
baked potatoes are one of the easiest things to cook and make a warming meal on a winter's day
below are
they are potatoes
do they look like little rocks
they do
okay this does not sound good to Mommy
below are two suggestions for different fillings
tuna and sweet corn
does that sound good to you tuna and corn in a potato
really it doesn't sound so good to Mommy
but you know maybe it's good but
it kind of looks like someone threw up
but don't let me hold you back
cheese and bacon ooh doesn't that sound good cheese and bacon on a potato
who likes bacon
that sounds good to me does it sound good to you
cheese and bacon you like bacon don't you
so this is how you bake
make a baked potato Sweetie
you wash your potato
and you poke it with a fork
and you put it in a hot oven
and then it gets all cooked and you cut it open and you can fill it with things
yummy
that's right
that's right
bird watching
it is hard for birds to find enough to eat in the winter so you can help them by putting out food and water for them in your yard or on a window ledge
this gives a good opportunity to watch them at close hand
know what we should probably do Honey
I think on our tree back there we have a bird feeder but it doesn't have any bird food in it do you think maybe this weekend we should buy some
and then we could see some really neat birds
maybe we could see a blue jay
or a cardinal
that would be neat
hmm
oh look it says here we can put bread or cheese or potato or bacon
birds like bacon too
everybody likes bacon
except for maybe a pig
surviving the winter
different animals have different ways of coping with the cold weather and lack of food in winter
some of them go to sleep all winter that's called hibernation
others have thick coats to keep them warm so they can continue looking for food throughout the winter
that's a little sleeping hedgehog
this is a marmot
it's an alpine marmot
alpine marmots seal themselves into their burrows underground and sleep for the winter
that is they sleep for half the year
six months
well that's right caterpillars will turn into butterflies right
bugs that's right sometimes they shed their skin
let's see what it says about summer and spring okay
look at the pretty paper daisies you can make
that's very pretty
yeah but this would be a pretty thing to make one day
we should make this with Phoebe I bet she would like to make these don't you think
would you like to take your Cinderella wig off Sweetie
no
looks pretty snazzy
planting seeds did we plant
we planted some things in the backyard didn't we
plant flower seeds indoors early in spring and they will flower in the summer
here you can see how to grow pansies from seeds but you can plant most other small flower seeds in the same way
you fill the little containers with soil
and you put two little seeds in each section
cover the box with newspaper and leave it outside
water every few days
that's interesting
I did not know that
after two weeks shoots will appear
that is very very interesting
hmm
how about that
soak the egg box wow you can plant them in the little egg box
I did not even know that
and put them in a big pot
is that a bad piece
you don't like the crust Honey
of the bread
no hmm
you know what I don't have any more bread those were our last two slices Mommy has to go buy some more bread
I don't have any more but I can get you something else
oh look at this from tadpole to frog
well I don't have any more toast Sweetie Pie
we hafta go to the supermarket to buy it
oh that is a beetle
that's a swimming beetle
whoops watch out for your
right
that's right
that's right
from tadpole to frog
early in the spring frogs lay their eggs which are called frog spawn
a newt
that's a newt
newt
newt
it's a newt
it's a newt
okay
frogs lay their eggs in
and those are newts
wanna hear about frogs how frogs grow
frogs lay their eggs in clumps of clear jelly which float to the surface of the pond
after about ten days
yeah that's kind of a little weird
after about ten days tadpoles wiggle out
that's what they look like it kind of looks
sort of looks like a frog but sort of looks like a fish
and they swim in search of food
the tadpoles then grow legs
and they come to the surface of the water to breathe
after twelve or thirteen weeks the tadpoles have turned into tiny frogs
wow that's neat
oh look at all these eggs that you can decorate look how pretty these are
that's right did you go did you go on an egg hunt last year
who'd
that's right with Matt and Aunt Jill hid all sorts of yummy treats didn't she in the eggs
yeah she's a good egg hunter
that's true you guys found bunnies too
you are right
oh look
that is cute
bunnies
bunny
bunny bunny bunny
look at the baby animals
the baby ducks
and what are these
little baby pigs called piglets
do you know someone named Piglet
who is he friends with
Pooh Bear that's right
oh summer
summer summer summer
what's that
butterfly that's right
spring is a good
that's a caterpillar
spring is a
mhm
caterpillar caterpillar
spring is a good time to look for caterpillars you might spot some in a garden or out in the country
many of them live on leaves but you may also find one wiggling across a path in search of its food plant
wow
he is looking at you
the tiny caterpillar eats and eats and grows bigger and bigger
and then it makes a hard case called a pupa around itself
or a cocoon
and when it comes out
well this is the little cocoon they make around themselves and when they come out of the cocoon what are they
ah a big butterfly or a moth
hmm
well this is a butterfly but a caterpillar can also turn into a moth
a moth is a moth
wow
oh yummy
that is tomatoes and mozzarella cheese with fresh basil
yes and you love cheese too so that's just delicious
we had mozzarella and tomatoes last week when Manny brought us lots of yummy tomatoes right
you want something to eat now
would you like some you want me to get you some champagne crepes
well how would you go about asking for that water
okay
put you some water in this cup for you okay
here ya go Sweets
tomato feast
sorry Honey I just coughed on you
let me hold this until you get up on the couch
can you scooch over a little
thank you very much
what do you say
you are welcome
mm homegrown vegetables taste delicious and you don't even need a garden
here you can find out how to grow tomatoes in pots
hmm interesting
maybe we should do that next year
yes tomatoes are red so delicious
yeah delicious
mm strawberries
that's yummy
hmm summer flowers oh that's very pretty
bug watch
what are those
beetles have hardened front wings that protect their delicate flying wings
look for them under bark
that's called a devil's coach horse beetle
and this is a green shield beetle
and this is a click beetle
that apparently is a cockchafer beetle
yeah and what's this
that's a dragonfly right
right
wow you are right
beetles eat all kinds of plants and animals and there are thousands of different beetles living everywhere
ants live together in enormous groups called colonies and they make nests by burrowing in sand or soil
if you watch where a line of ants goes you will probably find their nest hole
the ants work hard carrying food and other things back to the colony
they leave a scent trail between the food they find and the nest so the rest of the ants will know which way they went
bees there's a little bumble bee
bees feed on nectar a sweet liquid found inside most flowers
most bees gather nectar from one type of flower at a time
as a bee flies from flower to flower it also gathers pollen
the sticky yellow dust inside flowers
it carries the pollen to other flowers and this helps the flowers to make new seeds
that's great
okay you hold the bug page open Honey
okay
when I come back are you gonna tell me something great about bugs
you know what we may Sweetie what we may do later
we may hafta stop at the mall okay
we don't need to get beetles at the mall but we hafta get you socks you need socks at the mall
you want me to hold that you get comfy
did you learn anything exciting about bugs while I was gone
what did you learn
did you find did you learn that let's see
dragonflies fly
those are ants
dragonflies fly low above ponds and streams early in the summer
their brightly colored bodies flash as they swoop across the water chasing insects
you may see them resting on leaves their wings outstretched in the sun
butterflies and moths are attracted to brightly colored scented flowers
like bees they feed on nectar
watch how they stretch
yeah there's a butterfly
hmm
interesting
okay snail trail
snails live in damp shady places and are easy to find
that's a snail
a damp shady place that's where they like
damp is like kind of wet
mhm
let Mommy get a paper towel Sweets
here we go
better
delicious
snails slither along the ground
snail trail
snails slither along the ground leaving a trail of slime behind them
ew
slime
see here's the slime a trail of slime
the slime
yeah the slime helps them cling to things
no those are little eggs
those are little baby snails
those are baby baby snails
a snail has two pairs of tentacles
it smells with one pair and has eyes on the other
ew that is so neat huh
kind of yucky but neat too right
my goodness
that is very
oh the slime the slime
well
it's neat too
yeah
well you could touch some that's true I guess
snails usually come out to feed at night or after rain
this is because their skin is not waterproof
and they die if they dry out
oh look that's interesting
that's on top of a banana
that's the snail
and that's his shell
in the winter or hot weather snails hide in shady spots they close themselves into their shells with slime
most snails feed on plants and are especially fond of soft growing shoots
interesting very interesting
if you go to a beach you can have fun looking for shells pebbles and other treasures
it's best to explore at low tide when the sea is out
try looking along the line of seaweed that marks the high water level
at the top of the beach
I don't see any seaweed in this picture but
oh yes you are right
that is seaweed
seaweed
we saw seaweed when we went to the beach with Tamara didn't we
mhm what's this what's this
the starfish
a starfishy hmm
look at all these different types of shells
that is really neat
cone shells prickly cockle shells spider conch
cat's paw scallop
oysters
wow
mussels Welch's
that's pretty neat
hmm
beach treasures
there are lots of things you can do with the treasures you have collected from the beach
you could make
well
someone collected rocks and then painted pretty pictures on them
well now they are painted very pretty painted rocks
like you know that rock that they
that house down there has a rock with numbers painted on it
it's like that only they painted flowers and things on these rocks
very pretty
mushroom time
harvest time
many different foods and drinks are made from plants
fruit and vegetables come from plants but so do other everyday foods such as flour coffee cocoa oil and sugar
cocoa comes from a plant Honey do you know what cocoa makes
chocolate
you make chocolate out of cocoa beans
most plant foods are grown as crops and are picked or harvested in the summer
grain crops
look for combine harvesters working in the fields late in the summer
these huge machines harvest crops such as wheat oats rye and barley
that are grown for their seeds or grain
combine harvesters don't just cut they crop they also gather it together and separate the grain from the stalk
the grain is ground into flour or used to make bread or breakfast cereal
neat
what are these
oh you know what they look just like the black eyed susans it's hard to tell in this picture but those are sunflowers
right
because they are so big
right
it's
can you what
can you tell them yeah tell me what they are
they are sunflowers
in some countries with warm climates sunflowers are grown as a crop
that is string you are right
you did
the sunflower seeds are harvested and used to make cooking oil
let's not chew on your barrette Angel
corn
corn is a tall leafy plant grown for its plump yellow cobs of grain
most corn is grown for animal feed but it also
corn
feed corn
animal feed
animals eat corn a lot
chickens and cows well cows I don't know chickens
it's also used to make cooking oil breakfast cereals and popcorn
some sweet varieties are sold as corn on the cob
hmm and look at all the soft fruits
did we go picking
did we pick fruits
yeah we picked blueberries and raspberries right
oh look
wow
if the sun comes out between clouds when it's raining it shines through the drops of water and you may suddenly see a rainbow
rainbows are always on the opposite side of the sky from the sun so you have to stand with your back to the sun to see them
colors in a rainbow are always in the same order
red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet
wow
in spring the weather can change very quickly
strong winds and sudden showers are often followed by rainbows or sunshine
you can find out how strong the wind is by looking out for the signs around you
watching
the wind is the wind blowing very fast
yeah very fast
look at all this different types of clouds
the wind is too fast
yeah these you know these fluffy clouds are called cumulonimbus clouds
cumulus clouds

Beaver was the brave one she took her extra wheels off first
she practiced and practiced then she went to the park to show off
look at me she shouted I can ride my bike all by myself
Franklin watched Beaver ride around in circles
it wasn't long before Beaver could signal with one paw and hold on to the handle bar with the other
soon everyone but Franklin could ride without training wheels
we are going on a picnic said Bear come on

that's so that if they fall down they don't hurt their heads right
just like when you go skating you wear your helmet right

he sat on his bike and his mother gave him a push
Franklin wibbled@wp and wobbled and teetered and tottered
and he fell into the
oh no
I can't do it he said I'm never riding this bike again
for the rest of the week Franklin felt left out
he watched as his friends rode off without him
they were becoming great explorers on their bikes
what are they on here
a bridge
that's Rabbit's bike
that is Bear's bike
oh oh my gosh Honey you are absolutely right
you are right
you know what the purple one must be Fox's
right oh my gosh you are good
I didn't even realize
right
you are right and the blue one's Bear's because Bear is big right
right
right
on Saturday Franklin's friends zoomed by his house
that looks like fun said Franklin's mother
I can't ride without my training wheels groaned Franklin
did you give it your best effort asked his mother
well said Franklin maybe I could try one more time
Franklin sat on his bike
it's tippy he cried
his mother held on to the seat try it I won't let you go until you tell me to
Franklin pedaled while his mother guided the bicycle from behind
he felt very unsteady and very unsure
I'm going to fall he said and stopped pedaling
riding a bicycle is difficult said his mother but you can't give up just because it's frustrating
it's too hard for me said Franklin it was easy for my friends
do you think everything comes easily for them she asked
Franklin had to think about that
Franklin went to the park he saw Beaver struggling to swing on the monkey bars
each time she got to the third rung she fell into the sand below
no Beaver said Bear do it like this it's easy
easy for you said Beaver she tried one more time and fell again
maybe tomorrow Beaver grumbled
did you go on the monkey bars at school yesterday
what did we do we went this one then the next one then the next one then the next one then we
then you fell
but I caught you right you didn't really fall
Franklin remembered when Beaver when Badger learned to swim she was afraid to put her head underwater
it's easy said Franklin just do it
Badger had spluttered and cried it took her a long time to feel good in the water
but now she could swim from one end of the pond to the other
I think she's swimming underwater
are you gonna swim underwater one day
yeah
with goggles like Phoebe wow that's going to be neat
Franklin thought about the first time Fox played baseball
he couldn't hit the ball at all
but he tried and tried until one day Fox got a home run
he's playing baseball
like Daddy's team right
well Rabbit's just hoping that Fox can hit the ball
he wants Fox to do well right
and he's waiting to catch the ball he's got his mitt on
and if Fox hits the ball Rabbit is gonna get ready to catch it
that would be great
right Rabbit's gonna catch that ball wow
just then Porcupine came by she moved very slowly
she pointed to the pads on her knees wrists and elbows
they make me feel funny she said but they keep me safe
that's it cried Franklin and he hurried home
Franklin put on
padding
he lined the walk with old pillows
I'm ready to try again he told his mother and now I won't worry if I fall
Franklin sat on his bike and his mother held on to the seat
Franklin wibbled@wp and wobbled and teetered and tottered and he fell many times but he never gave up
then it happened Franklin told his mother to let go
he didn't veer into the bushes and he didn't crash
way to go cheered his mother
Franklin was thrilled
finally he was riding his bike all by himself
I can do it he shouted
Franklin rode to the park to show his friends
look at me he called
Franklin tried to signal with one hand like Beaver but he toppled over I think I'll work on that he laughed
not everything is as easy as it looks
sure
sure do you want Frog and Toad
Thanksgiving book

at our house my mom baked three kinds of pies
pecan and pumpkin and apple surprise
mm Daddy likes pecan pie

at night we were nestled all snug in our beds
while visions of turkey legs danced in our heads
and the very next morning Thanksgiving yippee we got up and watched the parade on tv
are you gonna watch the parade with Matthew this year on tv
relatives arrived from near and far
by taxi and airplane by train and by car
my brother came up the basement stairs lugging the kids' table and folding chairs
we counted and polished our best silverware
well you mean the little turkey
I think that's her hand
and then that's the napkin and then that's a little turkey napkin ring
right she's gonna put it down next to the plate right
yeah
we counted and polished our best silverware
and set the two tables with patience and care
the turkey went in and as more cousins came I laughed and I shouted and I called them by name
hi Danny hi Donny hi Paula and Vicky
hi Casey hi Kathy hi Brenda and Ricky
come in from the porch step into the hall
now come and play come and play come and play all
that's a teddy bear

oh there she is I didn't recognize her because she had a hat on and I couldn't see her ponytail
she has a hat on over her ponytail right
right
so up to my room my cousins they flew
we played with my toys and computer games too
they are dressing the cat up
that's silly
I don't know if the cat likes to be dressed up in clothes
no that's so silly
oh she likes to put her clothes on
okay
we made Pilgrim hats and funny shoe buckles then put on a skit
right the kitty cat has a bow on
and a little hat too

right and your tape right
right but we are always careful with our scissors right
here I'll put that over here Sweets
okay
wee perfect
we made Pilgrim hats and funny shoe buckles then put on a skit for the aunts and the uncles
all were assembled except Uncle Norm
who called us to say he was stuck in a storm
meanwhile my mother was getting out yams
cranberry jelly and honey baked hams
when mom wasn't looking we stuck olives on fingers
and said they were puppets and grand opera singers
are I think those are green olives
oh oh yeah oh
you are right you are right there are little tiny peppers inside the olives that we call pimientos
you are right
that's right they are yummy
mhm

mm
while dinner was cooking we played dodgeball outside
our tummies were growling can we eat yet we cried
the timer then sounded the turkey was cooked
Mom opened the oven she sniffed and she looked
when what to our watering mouths should appear
but a marvelous bird which caused us to cheer
it's a big turkey
right
its skin oh so golden the drumstick so juicy
the stuffing was fluffy thanks to Aunt Lucy
Dad slid out the bird it weighed thirty pounds
he turned and he tripped over one of our hounds
up in the air the turkey did fly
oh my gosh the turkey's flying in the air
right over the string beans
he's saying oh catch that turkey
over the string beans and straight for a pie
my brother and I made such a clatter as we leapt and caught the bird on a platter
alright said Grandpa get on with the carving
can't you see that these people are starving
Dad spoke not a word but went straight to his work
he sliced up the turkey and turned with a jerk
in front of our house we heard beeps of a horn
a trucker delivered none other than
Norm
with a wink of his eye and a twist of his head the party can start I made it Norm said
we all took our places the food smelled so great
we started to dig in but Dad said to wait
we are thankful that everyone is together this year
in our home and our hearts where we hold you so dear
that's right yummy yummy
right
we ate and we ate yet last but not least
the very next day was a leftovers feast
wow
look cranberry sauce

mhm and mashed potatoes
and stuffing

and some green beans or some sugar snap peas or something like that would be fun
sure
well why don't we read a different one
how about do you like Frog and Toad
oh how about this Frog and Toad
oh
okay let's see what we have here
should we start with spring
Frog ran up to the path to Toad's house
he knocked on the front door
there was no answer
Toad Toad shouted Frog wake up it's spring
said a voice from inside the house
Toad Toad cried Frog the sun is shining the snow is melting wake up
I'm not here said the voice
Frog walked into the house it was dark
all the shutters were closed
Toad where are you called Frog
go away said the voice from a corner of the room
Toad was lying in
oh my gosh
he had pulled all the covers over his head
Frog pushed Toad out of bed
pushed him out of the house and on to the front porch
Toad blinked in the bright sun
help said Toad I can't see anything
are you dripping on my arm Angel
a little lollipop drip
I do you are right
oh you are right maybe if you kiss it it will be better
thank you very much feels better already
mhm
but I can't see anything said Toad in the bright sun
don't be silly said Frog
what you see is the clear warm light of April
and it means we can begin a whole new year together Toad
think of it said Frog we'll skip through the meadows we'll run through the woods we'll swim in the river in the evenings we will sit right here on this front porch and count the stars
you can count them Frog said Toad I will be too tired I'm going back to
right
Toad went back into the house
he got into the bed and pulled the covers back up over his head again
but Toad cried Frog you'll miss all the fun
listen Frog said Toad how long have I been asleep
you've been asleep since November said Frog
well answered Toad a little more sleep will not hurt me
come back again and wake me up at half past May
good night Frog
but Toad said Frog I'll be lonely until then
Toad did not answer he had fallen asleep
Frog looked at Toad's calendar
the November page was still on top
so Frog tore off November tore off December January February March came to April
Frog tore off the April page too
then Frog ran back to Toad's bed
Toad wake up it's May now
what said Toad can it be May so soon
yes said Frog look at your calendar
Toad looked at the calendar and the May page was on top
why it is May said Toad and climbed out of bed
then he and Frog ran outside to see how the world was looking in the spring
wow
the story you sure know all the titles don't you
the story
one day in summer Frog was not feeling well
oh Frog you are looking quite green said Toad
but I always look green said Frog I'm a frog
well today you look very green even for a frog
he's a toad
and he's a frog
right
right
right
would you like a sip of your water with your pumpkin straw
that is one great straw
wait until Daddy sees that
he'll be so excited
how are you
do you remember what Trevor's gonna be for Halloween tonight
what's Trevor gonna be
right and do you remember what Phoebe's be
a tiger
and what's Kathy gonna be
you are right and what's Lily gonna be
a mermaid oh my gosh are we gonna have such fun
okay get into my bed and rest said Toad
Toad made Frog a cup of hot tea
Frog drank the tea and then he said tell me a story while I'm resting
alright said Toad
let me think of a story to tell you
Toad thought and thought
but he could not think of a story to tell Frog
I will go out on the front porch and walk up and down said Toad
perhaps that will help me to think of a story
Toad walked up and down on the porch for a long time
but he could not think of a story to tell Frog
then Toad went into the house and stood on his head
why are you standing on your head asked Frog
I hope that if I stand on my head it will help me to think of a story said Toad
Toad stood on his head for a long time
but he could not think of a story to tell Frog
then Toad poured a glass of water over his head
why are you pouring water over your head asked Frog
I hope that if I pour water over my head it will help me to think of a story said Toad
Toad poured many glasses of water over his head but he still could not think of a story
well chewing lollies is not good for your teeth
well you definitely can't chew without teeth but you have teeth but it's better to lick it instead of chew it
right because that could hurt your teeth
right
right and you know what if you lick it it lasts a lot longer than if you chewed it
it's true
yummy yummy yummy
that's one red tongue you have
then Toad began to bang his head against the wall
why are you banging your head against the wall asked Frog
I hope that if I bang my head against the wall hard enough it will help me think of a story
he has a headache
because he banged his head against the wall oh no
well he has a headache now he hurt his head
right
I'm feeling much better now Toad said Frog I don't think I need a story anymore
oh then you get out of bed and let me get in said Toad because I feel terrible
would you like me to tell you a story Toad
yes said Toad if you know one
once upon a time said Frog there were two good friends
a Frog and a
right
the frog was not feeling well and asked his friend the toad to tell him a story
but the toad couldn't think of a story
he walked up and down but he couldn't think of one
he stood on his head but he couldn't think of one
he poured water over his head but he still couldn't think of one and he banged his head against the wall but still could not think of a story
then the toad did not feel so well and the frog was feeling better
so the toad went to bed and the frog got up and told him a story
the end
how was that Toad said Frog
but Toad didn't answer he had fallen
right
do you wanna help Mommy make a cup of tea
what's this one called
the lost button
Toad and Frog went for a long walk
they walked across they walked in the woods and along the river
at last they went back to Toad's house
oh drat said Toad not only do my feet hurt but I have lost one of my
buttons
oh don't worry said Frog we'll go back to all the places where we walked and you will soon find your button
they walked back tall grass
here's your button cried Frog
oh that's not my button said Toad my button my button is white and that button is black
so Toad put the black button in his pocket
a sparrow flew down excuse me said the sparrow did you lose a button because I found one
well that's not my button said Toad that button has two holes and mine had four holes
Toad put the button in his pocket
they went back to the woods and looked on the dark path
here's your button said Frog
oh that's not my button cried Toad that button is small and my button was big
big but Toad put the small button in his pocket
who's that
a raccoon came out I heard you were looking for a button he said here's one that I found
well that's not my button wailed Toad that button is square and my button is round
but he put the square button in his pocket
the button yes I think it has holes
I think it has four holes but it's square instead of round
Frog and Toad went back to the river and looked for the button in the mud
here's your button said Frog
oh that's not my button shouted Toad that button is thin and my button was thick
Toad put the thin button in his pocket
he was very angry
he jumped up and down and screamed
our whole world is covered with buttons and not one of them is mine
Toad ran home and slammed the door
there on the floor he saw his white four holed big round thick button
oh said Toad it was here all the time
what a lot of trouble I have made for Frog
Toad took all the buttons out of his pocket and took his sewing box down from the shelf
then he sewed the buttons all over his jacket
the next day Toad gave his jacket to Frog
Frog thought it was beautiful
he put it on and jumped for joy
none of the buttons fell off
Toad had sewed them on very well
yay
oh my you are so drippy oh no
drippy drippy
Toad and Frog
let me get a little wipe for you
oopsie

and one more time boop

Toad and Frog went down to the river
what a day for a swim said Frog
yes said Toad I will go behind these rocks and put on my bathing suit
I don't wear a bathing suit said Frog
well I do said Toad and after I put on my bathing suit you must not look at me until I get into the water
why not asked Frog
because I look
I look funny in my bathing suit that's why
Frog closed his eyes when Toad came out from behind the rocks
Frog and Toad jumped in the water and swam all afternoon
Frog swam fast and made big splashes
Toad swam slowly and made smaller splashes
a turtle came along the riverbank
Frog tell that turtle to go away said Toad I don't want him to see me in my bathing suit
Frog swam over to the turtle
turtle you'll have to go away because Toad thinks he looks funny in his bathing suit and he doesn't want you to see him
some lizards were sitting nearby
does Toad really look funny in his bathing suit they asked
a snake crawled out of the grass
if Toad looks funny in his bathing suit I for one want to see him
we want to see him too said the dragonflies
me too said field mice
field mouse I haven't seen anything funny in a long time
Frog swam to Toad
did you drip on me
I dripped on you
I don't have anything to drip silly girl
I did but I don't have a lolly you have a lolly
I did
oh when I was cleaning your face
oh my gosh

yeah
did you finally go to sleep in your big girl bed
yeah do you love your big girl bed
oh yes sorry
I'm sorry Toad said Frog everyone wants to see how you look
I will stay right here until they go away said Toad
the turtle and the lizards and the snake and the dragonflies and the field mouse all sat on the river bank and waited for Toad to come out of the water
oh please go away cried Frog
but no one went away
Toad was getting colder and colder
he was beginning to shiver and sneeze
I will have to get out of the water he said I'm catching
a cold
Toad climbed out of the river and the water dripped out of his bathing suit and down on to his feet
the turtle laughed the lizards laughed the snake laughed the field mouse laughed and Frog laughed
right
what are you laughing at Frog said Toad
I'm laughing because you do look funny in your bathing suit said Frog
of course I do said Toad and picked up his clothes and went home
what's this one called
oh the letter yes it's true
Toad was sitting on his front porch when Frog came along and said what's the matter Toad you look sad
yes said Toad this is my sad time of day
it's the time when I wait for the mail to come and it makes me very
very unhappy because he thinks he's get any mail right
one more chin wipe
I never get any mail said Toad
not ever asked Frog
no never said Toad
no one has ever sent me a letter
every day my mailbox is empty and that is why waiting for the mail is a sad time for me
Frog and Toad sat on the porch feeling sad together
then Frog said I have to go home now Toad there's something I must do
Frog hurried home
he found a pencil and a piece of paper
he wrote on the paper
he put the paper in an envelope and on the envelope he wrote a letter for
Toad
he ran out of his house and saw a snail that he knew
snail said Frog please take this letter to Toad's house and put it in his mailbox
sure said the snail right away
then Frog ran back to Toad's house Toad was in bed taking a nap
Toad said Frog I think you should get up and wait for the mail
no said Toad I'm tired of waiting for the mail
Toad said Frog you never know when someone may send you a letter
no I don't think anyone will ever send me a letter
Frog looked out of the window the snail was not there yet
but Toad someone might send you a letter today
don't be silly said Toad no one ever sent me a letter before and no one's going to send me a letter today
the snail was still not there
Frog why do you keep looking out of the window asked Toad
because I'm waiting for the mail said Frog
but there will not be any said Toad
yes there will said Frog because I sent you
a letter
you have said Toad why did you what did you write in the letter
I wrote dear Toad I am glad you are my best friend your best friend Frog
oh said Toad that makes a very good letter
and Frog and Toad went out to the front porch to wait for the mail
and they sat there feeling happy together

today is Monday September twenty third and
we are in the new house and we are playing legos and we just finished having a big snack and playing with crayons

good idea
yeah I have a microphone

yeah I'm bringing the legos over here
in fact
let's play with the legos right up here
so just as a little preface this is a very this is very much a transition time for Naima since we've only slept in our new house three nights so far
although all our stuff has been here longer than that
and this week we have noticed that Naima
goldenrod
what did we do with the goldenrod
we were digging it
we've noticed Naima using adverbs of time a lot more and accurately some of the time like nursie now she says
or she says it's raining today
and she likes to say a while ago and she likes to say
I think she says yesterday and she has said tomorrow
what's up
raining tomorrow
it's raining today actually
and she's using personal pronoun you and me
mostly you to refer to herself much more frequently
Mommy carry you she'll say that
and it's also a transition time cause we are doing lots of new things and meeting lots of new people just in the last couple weeks
because it's the fall and we started new activities like music class and new music class with new kids in it
we've only been to that twice
and we are at a different group in the library with the big kids
and Naima started a swim class with Daddy and there's new kids in that and it's a new thing to do something with Daddy alone like that
and Naima has a potty now which is right here
which is a very
which is basically a toy right now
so all those things are going on
and there's a lot more sentences and long sentences
things off
you mean the legos
let's play with them up here

mm
the old gray donkey Eeyore stood by himself in a thistly corner of the forest
his front feet well part his head on one side and thought about things
sometimes he thought sadly to himself why and sometimes he thought wherefore and sometimes he thought in as much as which and sometimes he didn't quite know what he was thinking about
so when Winnie the Pooh came stomping along Eeyore was very glad to be able to stop thinking for a little
in order to say how do you do in a gloomy manner to him
and how are you said Winnie the Pooh
gloomy
gloomy
Eeyore shook his head from side to side not very how he said I don't seem to have felt at all how for a long time
that is
Piglet
and here is
who's this
Kanga
and who's that
yeah
dear dear said Pooh I'm sorry about that let's have a look at you
so Eeyore stood there gazing sadly at the ground and Winnie the Pooh walked all around him once
why what's happened to your tail he said in surprise
what has happened to it said Eeyore
it isn't there
are you sure
well either a tail is there or isn't there you can't make a mistake about it and yours isn't there

use a rope to get up to the door
of the owl's house

pa pig bought a new car to give to Ma pig on her birthday
she will certainly be surprised when she sees her new car won't she
oh this is the car store over here
on the way home pa stopped at a drug store when he came out he got into a jeep
by mistake see the jeep it's a green jeep
you should be wearing your glasses pa pig
Harry and Sally thought that pa had swapped cars with a soldier
then he went to the supermarket
when he came out he got into a police car
you made a good swap Daddy said Harry but pa wasn't listening and he didn't seemed to be thinking very well either don't you agree
ha look at that police fox
he is blowing a whistle and he's saying stop
stop
that's the pig family in a police car
driving a police car
who's in back of them that's a good question
oh the police fox is chasing them that's right
and then what happens
next he drove to a fruit stand to buy some apples
when he left he took farmer fox's tractor
my but pa is absent minded isn't he
oh there's the tractor
it's red
ma will certainly like her new tractor said Sally to Harry
they stopped to watch a fire
when the fire was up they left in the fire engine
how can anyone make so many mistakes
and now what's happening
then they
look at all that dirt
then they stopped to watch some workers who digging a big hole in the ground
no pa did not get into that dump truck by but by mistake he got into ha he drove the car into the hole

Ma Pig was certainly surprised to see her new car
there's Roger Rhino
I am reading the book
uhoh here comes Roger now he has found Ma pig's new car and he's bringing it to her
it looks as though he is very angry that means mad
with that someone who took his power shovel
does he look mad to you
mm I think he is mad
they are feeling a little bit worried I think
Roger please be careful you are squeezing ma's little car just a little bit too tightly
well let's all hope that pa pig will never again make that many mistakes in one day
hmm
he's mad
he's bringing the pig's car back to them cause he wants to get his steam shovel
pa pig took the steam shovel by accident
it's over here
she is very surprised and looks like Loly Worm's right here in the maw of the steam shovel
is that funny
that pig is worrying because the boat that he's in is about to sink
she's very surprised
the steam shovel is almost knocking her over
by accident
those are the pig children they are watching their daddy drive the steam shovel
let's see what else's in the here
these are different stories
I wanna look for a different story
oh here's a Loly Worm story okay let's go back and stick this one
the story is called the talking bread
Humper Dink the baker was mixing bread dough with the help of able baker Charlie Mouse
this little girl Flossy watch them squish and squash the dough
they are making dough for bread
you've seen me do that haven't you
yes I use a rolling pin when I make bread
that's the dough that's a lot of dough look at all the
they are kneading the dough
they patted it into loaves of all different shapes and sizes
balls yep bowls are like balls
then Humper Dink
that pig's name is Humper Dink put the uncooked loaves of bread in the hot oven to bake
that's the oven
they are putting the bread dough into the oven to bake it
okay what happens over here
after the loaves
look at all that bread on the wagon
there must be twenty loaves of bread there
after the loaves had finished baking Humper Dink set them out on the table to cool
oh here you are right on Mommy's microphone I didn't realize that
mm mm mm fresh bread smells good
Mama Humper Dink says Mama
let me just adjust this okay okay
Mama
that's what he says he's surprised
Mama
finally he took out the last loaf
listen did you hear that one when he pick that loaf it said oh it said Mama
huh but everybody knows that bread can't talk
the bread is talking Naima
it must be haunted
huh help police Humper Dink picked up Flossy and ran from the room
I must telephone Sargent Murphy he said
the bread said Mama
sergeant Murphy
that's the police dog
arrived in a hurry
he is driving the motorcycle without his shoes on and his shoes are tied to the end of the motorcycle
cause he was in such a hurry
he reached down and picked up the loaf of haunted bread
Mama
oh my goodness the bread is saying Mama
the bread is talking
Murphy was so startled he fell into the mixing trough
that's where the dough is
he fell into the dough
look at what a mess he is huh
at just that moment Huckle and Loly came into the bakery
who's gonna get him out is right I don't know who's gonna get him out
somebody had better get him out he is going to be all sticky and messy and gooey
that is a very strange loaf of bread
said Loly
yep
stretching out
here's Loly he's slowly ooched across the floor toward it
he's ooching across the floor
that means he's
that's how Loly
that's how Loly walks
he took a nibble the bread said nothing he nibbled and nibbled til only his foot showing
he went into the bread
and still the bread said nothing
Mama
oh my goodness
Loly stood up
that's Loly and the bread is on top of him
the bread said Mama
Loly took another nibble then stuck out his head I have solved the mystery
he's ooching across the floor up there

it's so she wants to take a bath
ah because she's all sticky
she'll ask you for some bubbles
that pig wants to have a bath with bubbles
when you give her the bubbles she'll probably ask you for a toy
you'll have to find your rubber duck
that girl is finding the rubber duck to give it to the pig who's taking a bath with bubbles in the bath tub
the duck will remind her of the farm where she was born she might feel homesick and want to visit her family she want you to come too she look through your closet for a suitcase
then she'll look under your bed when she's under the bed she'll find your old tap shoes
she'll try them on she'll probably need something special to wear them with that pig is making a mess

when the tree house is finished
she want to decorate it look the pig built a tree house
she'll ask for a wall paper and glue
when she hangs the wall paper she'll get all sticky

you wanna hang up the other sock
that one's the matching sock actually
yes
you are doing a very nice job

can you reach it
you can what
it was in the bath tub yeah
you'll find another set of socks
another pair of socks

can I show you something
if you pull it way down
oops Mommy made that one fall
then they
then they won't fall as easily
see
I was wrong
that did fall down
what yellow things
oh those are little
looks like they used to be little plastic butter flies
that are glued to the bath tub so that
no so that a person taking a shower won't slip
it's okay they are just plastic
yes honey
are you scared
just give me a nice big hug
why are you scared
of the plastic
plastic is nothing to be scared of honey bunny
you won't have to pinch me I'll carry you
it's plastic
it won't hurt you
do you hear that
good
the camera is making noise but I also heard the church bell
I think it stopped already

let's hurry up and hang those things up so that we can go to the play ground
we need to hang them up first
you a little scared
do you wanna go in the living room while I finish hanging this up
yeah
you are with me
alright I'll hold you
where's your microphone
by the way
okay
I will hold you and hang up my laundry
but I would like you to know that there's nothing to be scared of with that piece of plastic
I'm not doing anything to it
it doesn't matter
nothing needs to be done with it
nothing at all
yeah plastic butterflies
that's what they are for
but you know what we don't even use this bath tub
we don't even take showers in it
do we
we just use it to hang clothes
right
you wanna touch the
plastic butterfly
wanna touch it
want Mommy to touch it
okay
Mommy will touch it
yeah I'm rubbing it
it's flat
it's almost like a piece of paper
here actually you know what it peels right off
this is it
the plastic
we could throw them in the garbage
see it's plastic
should I see if I can get the other one off
you are standing on me
let's see if I can get peel the other one off too
we don't really need to have them in here
careful boo
this one is harder to get off
do you want to
next to the toilet
you know that garbage and you lift up the lid and put the butterfly in the garbage
yeah
yeah we took it off and we
put it in the and you Naima put it in the garbage
well I tried to peel that one off I had a little trouble
because it's kinda stuck
I'm not gonna do it right now right now what I want to do is finish hanging up the laundry
you are
you smell very nice
you were but then you touched it and you put it in the garbage

but it's not green briar
green briar doesn't have weeds
it's okay it's not green briar
oh everything's okay
Mommy thinks that you are scared
other thorns some plants have thorns
it's good to know which plants have thorns so you can stay away from them
but I don't think that's actually green briar
that's the thing that my microphone attaches to
that attaches to my microphone
I guess I'd call it a microphone clip
I think it's a microphone clip
everything's okay do you wanna play in the living room
okay
do you wanna get
yeah that plant
I'm gonna look at that and see if I can figure out what kind of plant that is
you know what that might
hmm
what is that
it might even be a rose
or it might be a blackberry
actually I think it's
it might be a blackberry plant or it might be a rose
rose bushes have thorns you know
they do
and roses are very nice flowers
you really need me to carry you
I'll carry you if you want me to
I wanna look at that plant

oh let's get the let's get the
camera
okay
and maybe we can go shopping after you are tired of playing
well the thing about going to the play ground is it looks like it's gonna rain
that means we really should go soon
if we are going to the play ground
because if it starts raining we can't go to the play ground
that's why I wanted you to go to the play ground now
because otherwise we might not be able to go at all
it might start raining soon
it's not raining right now but it might start raining soon
do you wanna try going to the play ground
well it's not raining right now
I'm with you
we won't go to the play ground if it starts raining
I would like to go to the play ground now but you told me you wanted to play here at home
you are gonna pretend the koala's going out in the rain
what are you doing
so that it doesn't drag on the floor
good job Naima
okay
that might be a little big for Koala Mala
you think
it might not be too big
well we'll see I guess
Kate is watching the Mommy Koala put on her rain coat
Naima's rain coat actually
let's see if we can get her to fit in this properly
she's gotta wear a rain coat you want her to play outside in the rain
I thought that's what you were telling me

okay
that koala is really ready to go out in the rain
let's find Naima's rain slippers

it's raining on the floor
what is she doing
oh she's playing on the side
with the slide
with the penguin

Koala Mala has her baby there but the baby doesn't have a rain coat
maybe we should make a rain coat for Koala baby koala Baby Kate Koala
what do you think
should we make her a rain coat
does that sound like fun Naima
we could make her a rain poncho
do you know what a rain poncho is
a rain poncho is a little bit like a jacket it also protects you from the rain

sit on it
yes
do you know what goes inside
and poop of course
of clourse
I think she is
and so is the cat
when I feel it coming I run for the potty

I pull down my pants and sit myself down
then I fill the potty with my very own pee pee
good job Naima
I think you peed
yeah
you could poop too if you want
you wanna pull down that flap
she has

mm that's the toilet paper
then
oh yep
someone older
mhm
someone
like a grown up puts the pee pee in the toilet
mhm
oop
Mommy will help you with that okay
there
diapers are okay for babies
there's a baby wearing a diaper

that's a good question
you can't see the grownups' potty in this picture

wait
wait please
n'kay
yeah this belongs here
okay you can flush now

like I've been saying
it's a good idea to always wash your hands
after you use the potty
well
after is more important than before
okay let's put soap on your hands
you know I want you to wash your hands before you touch anything
the thing is after you use the potty
you need to wash your hands before you touch anything else
and then I'll give you some water to drink
is it time to brush teeth

cause if you just peed in this
then you need a new one

just a bit more pee pee in you than you realized
okay

that's a little bowl of warm water
that's there because I'm
I was trying to clean those straps
the high chair straps

Naima no standing

you wanna have a little bit now
it's very salty isn't it
you want some juice or some water
n'kay

oh
I was afraid of that
when you eat salty cheese like that all by itself especially if you are really hungry that can happen
use both hands please
good job
you want juice
okay
I'll get you some
very slowly and carefully with that please
let me call
okay I'm gonna get it for you in a minute
four two eight six nine three three

how are you
I'm okay
how was your trip

three thirty or four
but I'd still like you to come
and
you'll
it'll just
it won't go as late as

is it hurting somewhere
where

right there it's hurting
well it doesn't look like it has a cut
is it really hurting
okay
well
it might be a cut that's hard for me to see
so I'll get some water
now
if it's hurting now from the kiwi that probably means it will hurt if you get tomato sauce on it
so I think you should try to
either use your other hand your right hand when you eat your spaghetti or you should use a spoon
or a fork
n'kay
okay
you want some more juice now
alright

I'll give it back to you

I was opening the can
I'm putting the top of the can into the garbage

see
it's strong
do you wanna have a sippa your juice
I'm gonna test the pasta and see if it's ready
oh it might be ready

I think it needs one more minute
it's a little on the chewy side
you can chew some but it's not quite ready yet
just needs another minute
I was pressing what kind of a button
on the timer
I was pressing a button on the timer
you are doing a good job not spilling very much
you are getting really good at feeding yourself
m'kay

I'm gonna pour all the water out
it's okay
it's the timer
here it is
okay
I'm gonna take this
I'm gonna cool down the
spaghetti by putting it in the pasta
turn that off
whoa that's too much for you isn't it
I'm trying to cool down the pasta by putting it in the cold spaghetti sauce
it will make the spaghetti cool enough to eat
in the Max book that we saw at the library
I think he says zoom when he comes down the chimney
this might be hot
let's just wait a minute and see
Mommy test it and see
it's just warm
I think that's okay for you to eat
do you want some more salty cheese
or not
you want it over here or on top of your pasta
I think Mommy's gonna sit and eat with you too
is that a good spoon for what you are eating
Mommy's very very hungry too
I'm gonna eat pasta with salty cheese

electricity
electricity
oh you are talking
are you thinking about when we were at the center for breast feeding

we were talking about the electricity there
hmm
the electricity wasn't on
y'an a little more tomato sauce
yeah
electricity is what makes the lights go on
like this
and the camera it makes
it's what makes the camera work
and the stove
electricity is good for machines
running machines
well
like the slide that's at Daisy's playhouse
that makes all that noise
a reason it makes all that noise is because it's using electricity
sort of
mhm
that's what it's called
electricity
it's a funny word isn't it
electricity is what
you used to
if you want to use a hair dryer
or a computer
or a dishwasher
or a light
a lamp
or the television
what else uses electricity
let me see
the blender
the coffee grinder
you have to use electricity to use all those things
even that computer

cause the windows were shut I think
ooh what was it that was moving
a fat rabbit
was he chasing the rabbit
sometimes dogs like to do that
oh his collar fell off
oh that's what happened to his collar
I always wondered about that
his collar is what has something on it that says
where he lives
zoom went the rabbit through the zinnias
was he a zigzagging rabbit
he is
zoom went the rabbit through the zinnias
zinnia begins with letter Z
did you know that
that's the letter that it starts with
is he jumping up to try to get the
oh he's chasing the rabbit's legs
I think the rabbit has a hole in the ground that it's diving into
so he
he's using
Mcduff is using a lot of energy to try to
follow and chase that rabbit
yep
that's exactly right
it says Mcduff was so tired from chasing the rabbit that he laid down in someone's vegetable garden and fell asleep
what kind of a vegetable is he sleeping under
an eggplant
oh
now what is he doing

at home don't play with matches
whoa
he's throwing the matches over here and he's lighting his presents on fire
keep toys off the stairs

the
a lots of the pipe and the kitchen is flooded
this is called a flood

that's dangerous
what's this dinosaur doing now
what is that
is that a phone
it is
it's a phone on the wall
like that phone
there's a phone on that wall
floating in a floaty and dialing for help
probly dialing
y'know what
I bet she's dialing the fire department
cause if there's a flood
the fire department is one place you could call to help you get rid of the flood
this is a flood when water goes where it's not supposed to go and there's a lot of it
that's called a flood
that's just what it's called
look the milk is floating
there's the dinosaur's tail
looks like she was cooking some peas
cause the pan of peas is floating in the flood
let's see what else we have here
a hot stove or heater can burn you
don't touch either one
don't bang on glass doors or windows
oh look she banged on it and it broke
don't tell strangers who phone that you are home alone
just say hello and ask them to leave a message
well you are not gonna be home alone Sweetie
you don't even have to worry about that
dino phone
never play with things stored under sinks or in medicine cabinets
they can make you very sick
oh
never play with things under sinks or in medicine cabinets
cause they are not toys and they are not to be eaten at all
they make you really sick
they make you throw up
cause
they are bad for you
it's not for toddlers
or dinosaurs
it's just a rule that's why
it's just a rule because it's a rule
oh she's getting burned
she's touching the stove
if an adult isn't home don't let strangers into the house
tell them to come back later
mm
always put tools back where they belong
oh yeah if you trip on tools
sometimes tools are sharp
it can really hurt
I don't know
don't climb on thin branches
thin branches can break
cause they are thin
during a thunderstorm stay out of water and away from trees
lightning often strikes in both places
she's in her kiddie pool
to get cool
to have fun
she's got a shovel and a bucket too
and a boat
is that a bathing suit
do dinosaurs need bathing suits
mhm
what's the question
why does she have a shovel and a bucket
I bet she is
yeah
that's a good question
maybe that
Spinosaurus
during meals chew well before swallowing
look at this
he swallowed the fish without chewing it
and now his neck is shaped like a fish
see that picture
that's not good
you need to chew a lot when
before you swallow your food
don't lean too
don't lean back too far in your chair
she leaned back and
oh a big mess is happening
pay attention when using a sharp knife
well
that dinosaur was talking to another dinosaur
while he was using a knife to slice this orange
but he kept talking and he didn't realize he sliced the toaster in half also
oh no
by accident
cause he wasn't paying attention
cause he was looking at someone else and talking to someone else
if you have a knife in your hand you can't do that
you have to look at the knife and be very careful with what you are doing
don't gulp hot foods
taste them slowly
you know about that
that dinosaur's mouth is hurting because he ate something that was too hot
I don't mean hot and spicy I mean hot temperaturewise
I don't know
this green soup
was too hot
this looks like a good book
well
I think right now I'm gonna do some more cleaning up in the kitchen
you could
you could read it
or you
you wanna have your bears do a craft
are you hungry

well when you put yours in the potty you can pretend you put his in too
hmm oh that must be the hospital building
that's what that is
mm what's that
where
yeah
and what's that
here's it is kind of it's a helicopter that works like an ambulance it also brings people to the hospital but brings them in the air
Gospal in the hospital
last year I was Gospal the dog walker
when our neighbors went on vacation I walked their dogs
and guess what I bought with the money they gave me
a key chain with a little
what
race car yes
what's this thing
a ramp
hmm I thought it might be Gospal's shadow
well it's it's got a little key chain with a race car attached to it
yeah
ramps don't have ears so it must be his shadow
every one at school wanted it but it was mine
I was scared that some one would steal it well I'm not dumb I knew a perfect place to hide it I put the key chain in my
mouth oh oh
what happens to him
he does
what do you think the teacher is trying to do
what blue thing
that's the bench that they are sitting on
what do you think the teacher is trying to do
because because he's sick
he swallowed something
oh dear
the teacher called an ambulance
there it is
the ambulance people put me on a stretcher they asked me what happen but I still didn't want to tell
oh see they don't know he swallowed his key chain
they just know that he's very sick
it was a little hard to explain why I put a key chain in my mouth
I hope that you never do anything like that it'll be very bad for you they took me to the hospital what do you see in the hospital here
mhm
what do you think that is
not the red thing see this white thing it's in the room
that's the special water going into patient's body
you had some special water going into your body when you were in the hospital remember
okay what happens next I had a big room all to myself
the nurse took off my scarf and put a white gown on me
don't worry she said we'll take a good care of you it wouldn't hurt
but I was still little scared specially when she took me to the x ray room
do you remember getting x rays
you might not remember you did get x rays couple of times
that's his x ray and that shows the key chain right in his belly right there
poor little guy ah
the doctors asked him to count to ten of course I said
can you count
one
two
three
I'm reading the story
I fell sleep after counting to three and dreamed I was a race car driver
they were right I didn't feel a thing when I woke up it was already night
my parents were right there and Mom gave me a great big
I think you are right
inside was a race car so big I would never be able to swallow it
that's the end of the story
again
yeah
I think you might be finished on the potty there
you do
did you do more poop in there
can I look
you just want me to read the book more but I'll read the book more after you get off the potty
oh boy
maybe we should call Daddy and see if he's coming home
well he wasn't stung by the yellow jackets and that's a good thing because he said he was allergic
why don't we give Daddy a call
you wanna take off that sticker
that's the price sticker
that's to tell people how much the book cost
you need your hair elastic fixed
well that you took off the whole sticker
that's not a sticker that's the that's printed on the book
hey do you wanna try to start ah making a new bedtime poster tonight
we could do that
yeah you took all the things off of it though so we need to make a new one that says what what we do at night time
alright one more time and then I think you done on the potty
I don't think you are peeing or pooping are you
ah all this is is the title of the book Gospal in the hospital
last summer I was Gospal the dog dog walker when our neighbors went on vacation I walked their dogs
and guess what I bought with the money they gave me
did he buy dog food
no did he buy did he buy a Chompo bar
hmm did he
did he buy a tricycle
oh a key chain with a little race car
everyone at school wanted it but it was mine
he's in school he's an animal who goes to school
I was scared that someone would steal it well I'm not dumb I knew the perfect place to hide it I put the key chain in my mouth
but gulp oh no I swallowed it
I think he did gulp it
oh my god
oh you think he chewed it
oh maybe he did he definitely swelled though
suddenly I felt very sick
he really doesn't feel well
what happened Gospal said the teacher but I didn't answer I was afraid to tell her about my key chain
I think he's may be embarrassed
well he wishes he hadn't swallowed the key chain
she called an ambulance
the ambulance put me on a stretcher
this is the stretcher
they asked me what happened but I still didn't want to tell
it was a little hard to explain why I put a key chain in my mouth
well that's a good question I don't know I guess may be he thought the other children liked it very much
they took me to the hospital oh those are the ambulance people
see there he's on the stretcher they are carrying him in
ah let see
this is the special water
it's a i v fluid
called i v fluid it's also called special water it's something that goes for some people when they are in the hospital they need to get it
that's a patient
that's the patient's bed
yes I think you are right
the people who go to the hospital usually are sick
mm
I was a little scared that's what this page says
they saw what I swallowed
well it's no fun to be in the hospital
they said you wouldn't feel a thing you'll be sleep they gonna go in and take the key chain out of his belly
I fell asleep after counting to three and dreamed I was a race car driver
they were right I didn't feel a thing when I woke up it was already night
my parents were right there what's that
it's a great big package
it could be a bath tub
do you think it's a bath tub
it could be an apple tree
do you think it's an apple tree
you are probably right
it could be ten pairs of pants
it was a race car
what a nice present from his parents that's the end of the story

okay
let's see
oh that's perfect I think he's looking forward to hiking
I think Griz is in the kitchen sitting in a chair let's go in 'cause I wanna start my water anyway
so you are hiking at Kawadee Head do you like it here
what are the kinds of things you can see at Kawadee Head
what's Griz gonna do at Kawadee Head
well he could find bear caves in the along the trail
oh what's the matter sweet heart

oh that's great should we go get some of those rocks
let's get some of the rocks for him
Griz got some at Blueberry Hill
oh gee I'm not sure I know which ones those are
but I know where there are some rocks
hmm
I think this would be make some very nice water for Kawadee Head
you get the rocks and
did you step on a lego or something
here are the rocks
okay Griz do you like throwing them
oh where's the backpack
the raccoon got out of it
oh is that why the raccoon got out
I see
ah
oh good
let's put your backpack on because you know what you are carrying your picnic lunch in it
you are on a hike you were on a hike to Kawadee Head and you need to still carry your lunch
well let's just pretend
really
where'r you gonna push Griz to on his very fun ride
oh does Kawadee Head have a play ground
oh the play ground with a bear walk
oh I'm trying to remember which one that is
oh I know where you mean
the I know the bear walk one where we took your shoes off
that was the Machias play ground
school play ground at Machias
yes we took your shoes off and it was a bear walk and it went up too
it was like bear walking up a hill
that was in Lubec that play ground
okay
meanwhile he's gonna find the doll
oh boy does he know that or is it going to be a surprise
oh Griz you are in for some fun that's such a great play ground
the main where we heard the hurdy gurdy
that was in Lubeck also
that was at a little shop a little actually a little art gallery and there was a hurdy gurdy man and a hurdy gurdy woman playing hurdy gurdies
nice musical instrument
you think Griz would like to listen to that music
great
oh
I'm going to come back and listen after I make my tea I hear the water boiling
mm
the raccoon plays the hurdy gurdy
wow
I can't wait to hear it I'm gonna come listen in just a minute
Naima we might go in a little while and bring shoes back to her
well I think we will
I'm not sure if we are gonna see her though that's the only thing
'cause she went somewhere to visit her cousins today
and I don't know if she'll be back
by the time we go
I think we'll go in about a half an hour
go and bring her shoes back
'cause I'm
because I'm sure she'll want her shoes
well they are her new shoes I don't think she's even worn them very much
she went out in the boots that you borrowed
I mean that you gave her
those are her boots now
'cause they were too small for you you've got
you've got bigger feet than she has
oh they are not very small but they are smaller than yours and they just fit those boots perfectly
would you like a raisin
mm
okay let's go hear that hurdy gurdy playing raccoon
I can't wait to hear it
I'm listening
oh my goodness
my clog is the hurdy gurdy
that's a beautiful black hurdy gurdy you've got there raccoon
are you turning the handle raccoon
do you remember the hurdy gurdies had handles that you turn
Griz is going to swim in the water
let's see how he swims
mm
are you gonna show him or does he already know
really
wow
woo look at you go
you guys are swimming together aren't you
I can just barely hear it
what does it sound like
you mean it sounds like the church bells

the red bell
on the floor right there
you mean your little bells
right there
next to the yellow chair on the floor the lego chair
near the helicopter yep

oh my gosh

oh
oh
what should we do
oh it was dark outside
oh and then is he having the snack of blueberries when he's home
blueberries in the car I bet that makes a big mess
you think so
the big vacuum cleaner not even the Dust Buster
you need to use the regular vacuum cleaner
to vacuum out the mess in the car
oh he must be a very little bear to make such a big mess
only little kids make really big messes
'cause big kids know how to be a little neater and clean up after themselves and they big kids don't drop their blueberries all over the place
because they know that it's good to put them right in your mouth
guhmuh what does that mean
he was
ooh y'alright

you may laugh at that but when I tell my friend secret she can talk all she wants but no one can understand her except another chicken of course my chicken not only listens to my stories she has other uses if you play with her and take her mind off of what's going on you can quickly very quickly snatch a feather or two when she's distracted she doesn't notice and feathers come in handy later of course

it belonged to two dolls named Lucinda and Jane
at least it belonged to Lucinda but she never ordered meals
Jane was the cook
but she never did any cooking because the dinner had been bought ready made in a box full of shavings
there were two red lobsters and a ham
a fish a pudding and some pears and oranges
they would not come off the plates but they were extremely beautiful
this is describing some toy food
one morning Lucinda and Jane had gone out for a drive in the dolls perambulator
which is another name for stroller
there was no one in the nursery and it was very quiet
presently there was a little scuffling scratching noise
in a corner near the fireplace where there was a hole under the skirting board
Tom Thumb put out his head for a moment and then popped it in again
Tom Thumb was a mouse
this is a story about mice
d'you want me to keep reading
a minute afterwards Hunka Munka his wife put out her head too
and when she saw that there was no one in the nursery she ventured out on the oil cloth under the coal box
the dolls' house stood at the other side of the fireplace
Tom Thumb and Hunka Munka went cautiously across the hearth rug
they pushed the front door
it was not fast
Tom Thumb and Hunka Munka went upstairs and peeped into the dining room
then they squeaked with joy
squeak
such a lovely dinner was laid out upon the table
there were tin spoons and lead knives and forks and two dolly chairs all so convenient
look they are eating
Tom Thumb set to work at once to carve the ham
it was a beautiful shiny yellow streaked with red
the knife crumpled up and hurt him
he put his finger in his mouth
it is not boiled enough it is hard
you have a try Hunka Munka
Hunka Munka stood up on her chair and chopped at the ham with another lead knife
it's as hard as the hams at the cheese monger's
said Hunka Munka
Hunka Munka isn't that a funny name
the ham broke off the plate with a jerk and rolled under the table
let it alone
said Tom Thumb
give me some fish Hunka Munka
Hunka Munka tried every tin spoon in turn the fish was glued to the dish
then Tom Thumb lost his temper he put the ham in the middle of the floor and hit it with the tongs
and with the shovel the shovel

Loli says ah

I think maybe we should make a dark cave
should we make a dark cave
you don't wanna make one
d'you wanna make a lantern
why don't we make a little lantern
let's see what would be a good lantern shape
oh I know exactly what would be a good lantern shape
you'll see
oh it's getting dark so early these days
okay let's see
here's a little lantern
here's a bigger lantern
and now we need a quite big lantern
hmm
hmm
I know
here are the lanterns
we should make a lantern cupboard I think
isn't that where Big Bear keeps the lanterns
here's a lantern cupboard
Big Bear can get lanterns out of the big lantern cupboard if he needs them
there's a small one a bigger one and then there's the biggest one of them all
should we have Griz be a big bear
Griz could be a big bear
oh you don't wanna pretend
you just wanna read
okay
because there's isn't much room to do things in in your room with books scattered all over the bed and the floor and everywhere okay
okay
all the bear paper dolls are in the book
Big Bear's carrying somebody
does Little Bear like to be carried and held
let's see
what's happening there
Big Bear is reading
the bear book
and in this one
Big Bear's carrying the lantern
which lantern is that
is that the biggest of them all
or is that the littlest
I think so
did you see that I put some lanterns in the lantern cupboard
oh
oh let's get Griz
mm
here I'll put it back on here
that's actually called the transmitter
the microphone is the other piece
look Griz is there next to the lanterns
oh yeah
okay
uhhuh
oh okay
does he need his bed to
d'you wanna use that white pillow behind you for his bed and this can be the blanket
alright
okay
oh okay
it's a very big piece though
I thought maybe it would be too big if I let it be flat
you want the whole whole thing on the ground
that's a big bed for a very little bear
excuse me Griz
well I needed to move him out of the way a little bit
that's such a big bed Griz
oh no the transmitter
if that transmitter falls down again I'm gonna hafta stop transmitting
well I don't wanna damage it by having it fall all the time
there we go
oh Griz is under his blanket
oh okay
what are you doing down there
are you getting some letters
oh are you gonna read to him
oh I bet he'll like that
oh
oh just like Mommy has a special place for books that are broken huh
mm you also have your own place
mhm
oh
oh
okay
you did say it in a nice way
you did
you did
let's see
you know I think that when we go to the library next we'll get one of the other Little Bear books out too
'member we've read some other ones about Little Bear
some other books like the one about plop plop plop plop plop plop
d'you remember that one
Little Bear heard a sound
I thought I heard plop plop plop
doesn'e say that when they go for a walk in the forest
can'tchoo sleep Little Bear
oh there they are
where's the cave
d'you see it
yeah
once there were two bears Big Bear and Little Bear
Big Bear's the big bear and Little Bear's the little bear
they played all day long in the bright sunlight
when night came and the sun went down Big Bear took Little Bear home to the bear cave
are you getting hungry sweetie
Big Bear put Little Bear to bed in the dark part of the cave
go to sleep Little Bear
he said
and Little Bear tried
Big Bear settled in the bear chair and read his bear book by the light of the fire
but Little Bear couldn't get
what's the matter with him
how come he can't get to sleep
why d'you think
can'tchoo sleep Little Bear asked Big Bear putting down his bear book which was just getting to the interesting part and padding over to the bed
whada you doing all the way over there
oh
well after I read this we are gonna have some supper
'cause it will be your supper time
yeah there aren't any pictures in that actually
we need put some pictures in there for you to look at
would you like to find some to put in there for you
do you wanna do that right now
do you want me to finish reading
okay
I'm scared
said Little Bear
why are you scared Little Bear
asked Big Bear
I don't like the dark
said Little Bear
what dark
said Big Bear
d'you want me to keep reading
the dark all around us
said Little Bear
Big Bear looked and he saw that the dark part of the cave was very dark
so he went to the lantern cupboard and took out the tiniest lantern that was there
Big Bear lit the tiniest lantern and put it next to Little Bear's bed
are you gonna do that
right next to Griz
there's there's a tiny light
whoops
whoops those things fell out
I will
c'mere
I don't know if it will transmit or not
you think it might not transmit
your beautiful voice
your wonderful voice
oh that's like a little table next to Griz's bed huh
nice
ah jeez
that was quite loud
oh and that transmitter is falling down again
I think we'll stop now
well I don't think you can have the transmitter because I think the transmitter's gonna stop working if we drop it one more time
let's see and we are recording
I'm coming honey
today is
two three let me see two
one two three four five
today's November fifth
it's Wednesday
and Naima and Mommy are both sick at home
we are both sick and we are going to read
Pippo gets lost
you wanna come sit on my lap
we've had this book for a long time
come sit up here
oh I remember there was something funny you used to say when we read this book
let's see I don't know quite how this would work here
you used to say
Mommy
when we used to read this book together
there's a certain page were you used to say
Mommy
okay sometimes Pippo gets lost and Tom has to look for him
where is he Naima
what's in the book
what do you see in this picture
all his toys are all over his floor
right
he
he needs to clean up I think
doesn't he
hmm
yeah that's a tennis racket
I see a train train also
okay
Tom asks Mommy if she has seen Pippo and she says Tom should look in his toy chest again
Pippo isn't there but Tom finds Pippo's scarf
looks like the elephant in the toy chest has a an undershirt on
see
and I see a clown
do you see the clown too
Daddy says did you look under your bed
but Tom only finds Pippo's hat
Tom gets really worried about Pippo and thinks he might never see him again
what is he saying
that's what you used to say when you were a baby
that's where you used to say
Mommy
Naima is very congested
you can probably hear that
even Mommy is congested
hmm it's nice to sit and read books when you are sick
isn't it
Mommy says that Pippo can't be far away and that they should look in the living room and that's where Pippo has been all the time
in the
bookcase
one more page
Tom tells Pippo to let him know before he goes away next time
do you wanna do the dinosaur sticker book that I put at the bottom of the bed
and I also put the magnets there
I mean the magnet boards
should we do the
play with those together
come back over here and we'll play with them
yeah we'll just bring it over
what
transmitter
come here twansmitter
the transmitter was kind of
in your way huh
let's see here
transmitter
it's a kind of a machine actually
which one do you wanna look at you wanna look at the dinosaur sticker book or the magnetic beach or the magnetic
construction site
do we have any magnets in here
huh we don't
let's see are any of them
hey
she's surfing on a surfboard
you know this is a surfboard it's something that you use to ride in the water
she's balancing on it and the board which is shaped like this floats on the water
it's like a
it's a thing to ride on a surf board
and let's see what else do we have here
this boy is also on a surf board
are they surfing together
they are surfing on the sand now
here's the lifeguard
I think most of the magnets are actually in the car
how about a dump truck do we ever see a dump truck at the beach
we did see a
something like this at the beach once do you remember it was making the sand nice and clean and flat
and there's a radio
how many sand pipers do you see
at the beach
do you see any sand pipers
four
try again
one
two
three
how many dolphins do you see jumping out of the water
right there are two dolphins jumping out of the water
when we were at Craigville beach
we saw a I don't know what you call it a special kind of truck for beaches
it was actually it was scooping up the sand in this part of it
and then it was putting it through like a sieve almost and it was taking all the garbage out of the sand and also flattening the sand
it was kinda like a road roller for the beach
do you remember that
that was one time when we were at Craigville beach
there's a car is there a truck at the beach today
this is a pickup truck
you know there might be a couple of other beach magnets in your room
somewhere although I don't know where exactly
on a surf board
because it's a fun way to ride see you can make them ride
wee she's riding the waves on a surf board
here's the
the life the lifeguard watches people who are in the water and makes sure they are safe
is she riding the waves
I didn't bring the tissues very close
ooh
toward the lifeguard
what's this magnet
oh that's the radio magnet
what
the other kid
oh here
that magnet's in the living room
do you know where
where in the living room
you've seen it there
hmm
I think most of the magnets are actually in the car in that box that's in the backseat
well because this was something that you were playing with a lot in the car
we could go and get them
if you wanna play with them
this one
okay
climb on board and get to town
there's some trucks there
that truck
this is
this machine
this smashes things see this thing
this thing smashes concrete
smash smash smash
and this
can scoop up the gravel
like that
I think that's a building that's being built there
see this is gonna be the second floor of the building and this might be the first floor of the building
and this is the second floor of the building
and this is the floor
and pretty soon they'll build walls
around all four sides
one two three four
they are going to build four walls
one along this edge
one along this edge
one along this edge
and one along this edge and then it will be a building
did you know that buildings usually have
a regular building usually has four walls
if it's square
that's a square isn't it
or maybe it's a rectangle
I think that's more like a rectangle
now Mommy has to get herself some tissue
can you sit up for a sec
Naima do you wanna have some more smoothie or some juice maybe
you could have a sippy cup or a bottle of juice
you wanna nurse again
I don't think there's any milk left
I think the milk
Mommy's nursies have to make more milk
oops
oh
microphone yeah
let's see if we can do that for a minute
you wanna take a little nap
you are snuggling right there
ah
you decided to snuggle right down
it's good to rest when you are sick
hmm
you are not hungry
in
the one in the living room you were talking about
we could go to the car and get the other ones too
you got it
oh is that the dolphins
or is that a different one
oh good for you Naima
you were right
I dunno where you found that
here you wanna put them in there
do you need to blow your nose with a tissue
you were doing good job being a camel before
the lifeguard is in the water
the lifeguard's chair is in the water too
the dolphins are jumping over the lifeguard's head
that's kinda silly isn't it
oh everyone's on top of the lifeguard now
I wanna be a lifeguard
life life life life I
wanna save your life
that's a song that Mommy remembers from
a long time ago
I believe that that is a song by Johnathan Richmond and the modern lovers
I've never seen a lifeguard
floating on his chair in the water like that
that's very startling
do you want me to go to the car and get the other beach stickers
what happened to this
this was in your pocket
I don't mean stickers I mean the magnets
do you want them
okay
I think I might put my clothes on while I'm at it
and then go out to the car I guess I'm not gonna take a shower for awhile
okay
ho ho ho ho
alright
what looks like Naima
does
is there a child that looks like Naima
hmm
let me just put some clothes on
and then we'll go get those out of the
who used to make it do that
wig a dig dig and away we go
what do you see outside
do you see any birds at the feeder
yeah
yeah
yeah
hi little tiny baby that came out of her mama's belly
she's crying just like a baby
yes those are nursies in my bra
hi honey
why you pushing me
yes
yep
oh you know what we should probably do
oh except your tired
we should go to the store and buy
garbage bags and we should buy eggs so that we can eat eggs today
you don't
I'm gonna wash my face
well that's some face cream for Mommy
yep okay come off the stool
let's put some socks and shoes on you and we can go out to the car and look for the magnets
I think we might actually need something to carry them back in here with don't you think
you are gonna bring them in here and play with them
where's the one who looks like Naima
is there a magnet
with a picture of a child that looks like Naima
it's what
it's walking
the child
you wanna stay in the house while I get them
I don't think I'm gonna carry you out to the car
oh you can stay here you know it if you are not gonnna put your shoes and socks on
you can stay in the doorway while I go and get them
you can't come out without shoes and socks on
and I'm not gonna carry you
it'll just take a minute
oh is it raining out
it actually is raining a little tiny bit
you stay there
and I'll get the magnets
especially because it's raining
Naima stay in the house
Naima
stay in the house please
I'll be right there
here's the magnets
oh which book is that
oh you wanna match the letters
that's a great idea
the name of the book
which letters
do you wanna use the magnetic letters or the block letters
are there letter stickers in that book
you mean these letters you wanna match
okay
I don't remember that there
oh right right right I know what you are talking about
the words that are in blue
okay we could do that
there was lots to do Arthur gave Kate a ride in a little fire truck
the words fire truck are in blue
so can you find any pictures of a fire truck
in the page of stickers
I don't see a fire truck there
hmm
maybe some stickers are missing
okay
alright well I don't see the fire truck that one is missing
because I haven't found that one
I think maybe you used the stickers for something else
let's see this is apples or strawberries right
that's the word puppy in blue and I see a sticker that has
Pal the puppy here
puppy
p@l u@l p@l p@l y@l
for example this does not belong here
and there's shoes I bet there's a blue word shoes somewhere let's look for a blue word because there's a pair of shoes
hmm
that's the word shoes
s@l h@l o@l e@l s@l you can put those right on that word
yep
back at the street fair the clown with balloons tripped over his big floppy shoes
crash down he went
and as he fell he let go of his balloons
then guess what a little brown puppy jumped up and grabbed the balloon strings
that's in blue
with his teeth that's also in blue
do we have a sticker that has strings or teeth
I see teeth
a teeth sticker
do you see it
we need a tissue
ooh you see the teeth sticker
no actually these are the teeth look
that's a teeth sticker
oh where's that word
teeth
what letter do you think teeth begins with
what letter do you think that is
yes t@l very good
there you go
that's where teeth is and it does begin with letter t@l
okay let's look for another word
that
that is in blue
let's see
start at the back this time
that's the word one
the number one
and that's the number
that's the
ah word red
well I don't know
I don't see a sticker that has
maybe
yeah maybe it's somewhere else
you did
okay
I'll just look through the book and see if there's any stickers that are
there's the number one
see
that goes on the word one
and the sentence is when he got home he still had one beautiful red balloon
very good Naima
one
hey
is that an Arthur sticker
oh my gosh
you put it right on top of Arthur
let's find more blue words
some of them we've already done
red we are still looking for something that's red
all the blue words are covered up already there
we need strings
somewhere there's a sticker that should be a picture of strings
hmm
hmm
oh there's lots of blue words here
Arthur passed the ring toss table
I think there's a picture of a ring right
didn't I find that
here we go
what letter do you think that word begins with
ring
ring
can you guess
very good r@l
that's where the word ring is
see there's a lower case r@l that starts the word
put the ring right there
r@l i@l n@l g@l
ring
let's see what else
oh
yeah I think actually a bunch of these things go there
Arthur passed the ring toss table
yep
and there's the word table
right there
and there's a sticker for table
table
can you find the word again
great
Arthur passed the ring toss table
the bob for apples table
the word apples is in blue
apple
do you know what letter that begins with
apple
ah
very good Naima right there
that's where the word apples is
and you are right it begins with a@l
and a table with pumpkin pies
that word
that's actually two words pumpkin pies
but there's only one sticker do you see a picture of pumpkin pies
I don't think you've ever seen pumpkin pie
that's what it looks like
and take this
okay put it right on the pumpkin pies
pumpkin pies
what word begins with p@l
yeah
right here see
pumpkin pies
good
chocolate cakes and cookies
are the cakes
pictures of cakes
and the word
what letter do you think cakes begins with
that's a very good guess
because both c@l and k@l make the sound kuh
but for cakes it's actually c@l not k@l
see that begins with letter c@l
that's the word cakes
but you are right kuh sometimes is made by letter k@l
let's see
what else do we want here
yeah I've
see these stickers we could probably put them where they belong instead
hey and I see the color red which was on that page where the balloon is
hold on to this sticker
and I tape it off and give it to you
okay do you remember there was a page
where the color red
yes
what letter do you think red begins with
very good Naima
let's see
and there was something about an ice cream cone
right
hmm
cone
right there
that word down there is cone
cone begins with C too
this is a little
train
truck
you are right I said the wrong thing didn't I
okay
I'm looking to see if there are any other blue words
I think mostly we are done with that part
because I think we've
fire truck
oh maybe that's is that a fire truck
but that's a green truck
that's not a fire truck
hmm
you know what we could put these other stickers on a plain piece of paper and we could write a story and use the stickers
would you like to do that
okay
well this isn't part of the story
I can read the story if you want
alright
Arthur's Lost Puppy
what's that noise
Arthur and D W took baby Kate to the street fair
Pal came along too
there was lots to do
Arthur gave Kate a ride in a little fire truck
that went around and around
D W got her face painted
look Kate she said
I'm a cat
but Kate was looking at something else
suddenly Kate began to cry
are you hungry asked Arthur
here's your bottle
but Kate did not want her bottle
wa wa wa she cried
do you have a wet diaper asked D W
but Kate's diaper was dry
and still she cried
wa wa wa
Arthur lifted the baby from her stroller
he rocked her in his arms
he tickled her tummy
he made funny faces but still she cried
wa wa wa
Kate loves ice cream says Arthur
run to the store D W
and get a
get her a cone
because these are stickers that don't really belong here
we can use them for something else
let's see
D W tied Pal's leash to a bench
and went into the store
a clown with balloons walked by
Pal barked at him
woof woof woof
when D W came out of the store Pal was gone
she looked up and down the street
that dog is trouble
she cried
and she ran to tell Arthur
oh no cried Arthur why would Pal run away
maybe he's mad at you said D W
you yelled at him today for chewing your slippers
Arthur said nothing
he just looked very sad
but Kate had a lot to say
wa wa wa wa she cried
then Arthur said D W take Kate home maybe she needs a doctor
and I need to find Pal he began calling
here Pal here Pal
here Pal here Pal
Arthur passed the ring toss table the bob for apples table and a table with pumpkin pies chocolate cakes and cookies
he wished there was a table with hamburgers
Pal would be sure to be hanging around it
have you seen a lost puppy Arthur asked the police officer
a lost puppy said the officer
yes one was taken to the
is that the police station
to the school
let me see
yep
one was taken to the school
oh thank you said Arthur and he ran to the school
but the lost puppy was not Pal
Arthur sadly walked home
back at the street fair the clown with the balloons tripped over his big floppy shoes
crash
down he went
and as he fell he let go of his balloons
then
guess what
a little brown puppy jumped up and grabbed the balloon strings with his teeth
do you wanna blow your nose
the balloons rose higher and higher
over the
roofs
over the
trees and up up up they went
and so did Pal
look someone shouted
a flying puppy
a flying puppy
do puppies have wings Naima
what has wings
puppies do
puppies don't
you wanna nurse
okay
and
then suddenly bang pop bang the balloons hit a tall tree
one by one they burst
Pal floated slowly down
when he got home he still had one beautiful red balloon
and one was all he needed
to make baby Kate happy
oh my pumpkin
yeah okay
is that a good snack you are having
is it yummy
would you like some fresh banana too
okay
you could have some plain yogurt if you want
yeah
okay
the men on Zoboomafoo
I think they call him Zaab as a nickname
because his full name is Zaaboo
and Zaab is like a nickname
you gonna have this yogurt
you want anything with it
you could have a little banana
you could
alright
hmm
more blueberries
and wheat germ
you want the kind in the red container
hmm
let's see and I'm gonna drink some juice
because juice is a good thing to drink when you have a
cold
would you also like some apple juice
in a sippy cup or in a bottle
yes or no
okay
I will give you some water
what
oh
I know exactly what you are talking about and there's a picture of
a boy peeing standing up that way too in the book
mhm
that's the picture you are talking about in the potty book
yep sometimes boys and men can stand up to pee
and they don't have to wipe their bottoms
and you've seen
you've seen Daddy do that when he takes you to the Y M C A for swim class
what friend is behind the tissue box
oh it's Mr Grizz
it's Mr Grizz
do you need more yogurt
no
he is
what's the matter with him
running away
because he was so sick you mean
oh he was too sick to climb trees
that's pretty sick for a bear
yeah
that's good
just like
he walked outside
is a plant easier to climb than a tree
huh
do you want something else to eat sweetie pie
oh I'm glad he's better
you want something else to eat sweetie
you wanna get down
do you want some crayons
and markers
do you wanna sort the buttons
what do you wanna do
you wanna go in the car
do you wanna get down
oh it's Mrs Grizz
hello Mrs Grizz
you wanna try one of the cookies that Baba G made
he made them
these have cardamom in them
I can smell it can you smell cardamom
yeah
he put them in there
I think he thought it would be a good flavor in the cookies
hmm
Grizz says what
a muntamum
oh muntamum is instead of cardamom
is that bear language
I see
bear
bear
wondering inside a sponge
or wandering inside a sponge
you know what I think if you are done I'm gonna take away your food because I don't want any extra mess to clean up
and I think you are done aren't you
should we do that
should we take him in the car
oh already that's where we are
huh
well maybe the bird is Dr Bird
no
yeah
yep
because a tree is sometimes
a good place to hide from
animals
that wanna eat them
animals that can't climb trees that is
like
I dunno I think raccoons might eat birds eggs
raccoons can climb trees though
I
see yeah so I dunno
some
not all birds build their nests in trees though some birds build their nests in the grass
or in the sand
at the beach
or some of them even build their nests in houses
like in the little spot up there
I see a yellow jacket nest right there
I think those yellow jackets moved their house over here
right there
now that I'm looking at that I can see there's a little yellow jacket home
you wanna get down now honey
it's hard to see from here it's camouflaged but I'll show you next time we go outside
you wanna get down
camouflaged means it's the same color as the thing that it's on
oh there's chickadee
hello chickadee
have a little of your water
it's good for you it'll help you feel better
juice

her cave
oh is she hibernating
oh
I'll be very quiet
good morning bear
good morning bear

good night bear
good morning

oh my gosh
oh okay
well the bear's going to sleep now
good night bear
the mommy bear's going in here for a minute
I guess that bear is asleep
so I'll just put away some clean dishes for a minute
I think I hear a bear in there
oh mother bear to come in
okay
hello
is my bear cub waking up
or is my bear cub asleep
I better be
I'll be very quiet
yes
hello bear cub
a scary bear okay
you are very scary Naima bear
I'm gonna put this away in the kitchen where it goes
okay good night little baby bear
okay I'll say that
let's see I thought I heard a funny noise in here
what's that
I think it's a bear
waking up
coming out of her cave
scaring her mama
good night bear
okay I'll come and say that in just a minute
okay I'll be right there to say that in just a sec
hmm I hear a funny noise in the living room I wonder what that noise is
hmm
I wonder is it a rabbit
maybe it's a rabbit
maybe it's a
chicken
maybe it's a snake I better find out what it is
this must be a bear's cave and that must be a bear in there
it is a little bear
that's a roaring bear
she is
I'm gonna put this away over here
you are very scary
okay good night little bear
what's this it must be
a bear
the
what shall we call it
the little bag that clips on
should we go get that
to clip it on you so you can wear it
you just wanna eat grapes
okay
I'm gonna give you the grapes over here
find what
uhhuh
you already found them
you can have them out of this bowl if you want
it's a colander you are right
it's a strainer
I'm gonna put this here okay
are they good grapes
that's good
cause it's a transmitter
without having it bother you
if you are walking around it would be a good idea to
to wear it and put the transmitter in it
you could carry Olivia and the transmitter in it
is she too little to have a transmitter
mhm
well you know Amanda and Katherine sent us that for the transmitter but I think they wouldn't mind if Olivia also rides in it
Olivia might actually enjoy riding on top of the transmitter
what do you think
she might
she could stand on top of it in the little pouch
that might be fun
but we'll we'll get that in a little bit
we are going to cook some things now
after
you can have your snack
that's fine
you could put rags away for me in a minute too
that's fine you can just eat
it's fine
what am I doing
I'm making saag@sund which means I have to wash a big bowl full of
mustard greens
that kind of a vegetable is called mustard greens
one in
hanging in the bag there
that's what that is
well I need to put it in a lot of water to wash it really nicely
to make sure that the mustard greens get very clean cause we are going to cook them and eat them
cause they don't taste very good if you don't cook them
I think they are kind of bitter
I think they taste bitter
bitter is a flavor
lemme think if you've tasted anything bitter
I think you have tasted something bitter but I'm trying to think of what it was
you know what you had that was a little bit bitter
do you remember once I think you ate some brie@sfra cheese
when we went to Prodigal Son in Hyannis
and Mommy got some brie@sfra cheese and some fruit on a plate to eat
I think that you tried it and I think you actually liked it
but that flavor was a bitter flavor
well I don't really want this shirt to get messy cause this is a shirt that I like
and I'm gonna do some cooking
adjust this a bit
today is November
Thursday November fourteenth
so we are just about a week out from last time we taped
I'm gonna get the bowl
do you remember that
it was quite a while ago
he likes to go there to get coffee sometimes
he likes their coffee the way they make coffee there
he just does I think
I think he thinks it has a good flavor
I think he thinks the coffee that they make at Prodigal Son has a good flavor
well you'd have to ask Daddy
he's the one who knows why
Daddy's friends
okay you asked me what bitter is right
if you taste that and chew it for a while you'll see what bitter means
the flavor of that is bitter
actually it's also spicy so you might not like it
why don't you take it out
those are spicy greens
ooh we are gonna have spicy food tonight
do you like spicy food
do you think likes spicy food
do you think likes it
do you think Daddy likes it
do you think Mommy likes it
the Sleepy likes it too
I think Sleepy likes it
a little what of paprika
a drag
a drag of paprika
I don't know where you got that word from
a drag a drag
cause we are gonna make saag@sund which is a very nice spicy dish and we are gonna have spicy fish too
spicy nag
oh that sounds very interesting
spicy nag
what ingredients does it have
egg and milk and all that kind of stuff
mm

mhm
he uses that one when he cooks
and he doesn't know any better
I see
who is gonna jump into the neighbors
oh a squirrel
oh
oh I see it
I don't know if we are looking at the same one but I see one right by the fence here
are you looking at a different one
oh no it's the same one
the neighbors' yard
yeah I bet he will
oh where'd he go
did he in front of the neighbors
oh there he is again
look at him wiggling his tail
that's funny
you know that's something for us to look up
why do they make their tails move like that
hello
hi
good how are you

it won't be three hours but
oh

byebye
I just needed to talk to her
cause she might be coming tomorrow
tomorrow we are gonna play with in the morning
if it's not raining then we'll go to Old Townhouse Park
cause that's a really nice play ground and we don't go there very often
but we could go there with him
if it's raining hard then we'll probably do something different but we'll do something with
did you hear me leave that message for his mommy
when we were in the car
yeah if it's raining we might do that
I didn't say yes I said maybe
because I need to talk to her about it first and that's only if it's not

that will be really really fun
do you want some other snack to have

if Daddy asks you about the school you visited today what are you gonna tell him about it
if he says what was it like at that school what do you think you will say
yeah
uhhuh
will you tell him about the different kinds of toys you saw there and maybe the the ladder and stuff like that
the ladder that you thought was stairs
what toys did you see there
a felt board yep
you took your transmitter off
oh my gosh
you want me to clip it on
it it works kind of like a clothes pin
you squeeze those
except it's really harder than a clothes pin
you could actually really pinch yourself if you aren't careful
so I'd rather that you left it on cause
you know why cause we are taping right now
Naima that's not to play with though okay
can you put that down
you are shy
well you might be shy but that's not to play with
Mommy's gonna come take it away
it's not to play with
it's not to play with
nice to meet you too Michaela

okay
he said what
he said yeah Michaela
yeah Michaela
oh yuck

mustard
see
there's the t@l right in the middle
cozy
what's what for
oh I was just having fun
it's just
are you cozy when you get into the bed between Mommy and Daddy at night
or in the morning
in between
well being in between
us is cozy so I was just joking that it was cozy for the letter t@l to be in between in the middle of all those other letters
that's like a joke
Tozy very good yes
alright I'll write it down
one second and I'll write it down
you mean like the name of the cat in Mrs McCats
Tozy
I guess that means the word toes
also begins with t@l
mhm
yes
a puppy comes out at the end yes
I think you are right
now it spells oy
are you gonna eat those cookies by the way
now it spells yuh@n
now it doesn't spell anything
yuh@b
it spells yuh@n
just a minute
Mommy needs her recipe
it's a bitter taste
isn't it
in a minute
oh Naima
are you going to eat any of those cookies
no
boys and toys
oys@n
ah
oys@n and doys@n
I think you are right
it spells
it doesn't spell anything actually

it spells t@l y@l
it spells oty@n
it just spells oty@n
no it spells oty@n
want me to spell toy
that spells toy right there
well then you'd need an s@l and I don't have an s@l here
I don't have an s@l here

oh I found an s@l
now it spells
mhm
ah okay
it spells oys@n
it spells ys@n

it doesn't spell anything
whoop jeez
that phone is very sensitive
it spells yots@n
no the t@l has to be in the beginning
the t@l has to be the first letter
what you have there
o@l
you need o@l to be next
o@l and then y@l
and then s@l
and now it spells toys
oys@n
it spells eez@wp
it spells ss@n
just a minute
why don't you tell me what it spells
you can't tell me what it spells
oh okay
just a minute
I'm cook
trying to cook some things here
I can't I can't look over there every single second cause I need some
to pay some attention to what I'm doing over here
babe

it's very delicious with ginger
okay that's hot
mustard greens

yeah that's mustard greens
yes that's mustard greens
that's mustard greens that's not cooked
this is mustard greens that's cooked
that's that's just what it is
there is a y@l
let's see
can we spell
we can spell so s@l o@l
like when Camilla Capiberra says so there
that spells so right there
that spells tso@n
t@l s@l o@l spells tso@n
tso@n
that's not really a word but that's what it would sound like if it was a word
so there
well it's just kind of a mean thing to say that's all
well I think you are eating the y@l
I think you are eating the y@l Naima
hello Michaela
is that what Henry the hippo says to Lars the polar bear
who are you and why are you so white
I often wonder that myself
yes
mm it's a good question
it's a good question
oh my gosh I do have an apron on
do I look a little bit like a polar bear
wearing an apron like this
I guess I must
mm
I have an idea about what's scary
I think there is something scary in here
I think it's a little girl who's scary
it's not a little girl
what could it be then
oh my gosh a bear
yikes
yikes
the bear is demanding salmon
oh brother
bah
I will give you some salmon
do you want some
I happen to have some right here for bear emergencies
I also have bear food for bear emergencies
it might be a little bit spicy why don't you try it
you've had it before
it's the same kind you had the other day
I think you liked it
it's salty but I think you liked it
cause you ate it
that's how I could tell
you actually ate it
it actually has salt in it
that kind of salmon
smoked salmon
that's just what it's called
cause been smoked
that means it's been cooked in a certain way
using some salt
and some smoke I think
okay big noise coming
watch out cause I'm gonna use this
close your ears if you need to
it's not
it's the Cuisinart noise
mm okay
I'm done doing that
oops
sag
are you still eating the salmon and the cookies
you are
I see
okay
you can let me know when you are done
I'll give you something else fun to do
oh
do you want to get down and play in the living room or do you want me to give you something fun to do here
okay
just a minute
I have to get it
he did what
he fixed the toast tongs
yeah we'll look for the wood glue later
okay
he did
I see okay
oh
right to the end no
okay
these are walnuts with the shells still on them
I'm gonna give you another muffin tin to put them into
or you could actually put them into the ice cube tray
in fact you could do
are they too big for that container
okay
mm okay I think you are right
so why don't we use this other ice cube tray
we'll take these out
and you can actually
I think we have a muffin tin that has twelve
yeah
I'm gonna give you this big muffin tin
because this has got twelve
and the ice cube tray also has twelve
does it
three four five oops
that has a different number actually
that's alright though
why don't you put them
you can just put them wherever you want okay
this isn't like the sponges where you make them all go in the same
these are different kinds of nuts
you can practice putting them in there
whoops
whoops whoops whoops okay
taking the nuts out
there you can take them out with your fingers
that's another walnut
that's an almond
actually you know I'm not sure
I think it's a Brazil nut
but I'm not positive about that
I think it's a Brazil nut
let me see
I think that's a hazel nut
there are lots of different kinds of nuts
that's a hazel nut
just a second
I'll look in a second
just a second
let's see
show it to me
I think that's a hazel nut
I think that's another hazel nut
just a second honey
the ice cube tray has more than twelve and the muffin tin has twelve places for twelve muffins
and I need some salt
just a second honey
let me see
oh
well I'm not sure
I don't remember
that's something we are gonna have to look up
usually when I buy nuts they already have the shells taken off of them
what you have there are the nuts with the shells still on
they have to be broken to be eaten
let's see
that one I'm not sure
you are right it is
those are the same
they match don't they
you have matching
do you wanna match match the different nuts and the different kinds
why don't you put all the nuts that match in one container and all the nuts that look alike with the dark brown in that container
no I mean you put all the ones that like like this in here put all the ones that look like that
oh you've kind of already sorted them for yourself
I see
if you want to do that
you don't have to do that
I was just suggesting that you sort practice sorting
they are too hard for your teeth to chew them
they are just too hard
it would break your teeth if you tried to
crack them
but a bird or let's see some other kind of animal with strong teeth could probably do it
people don't have teeth as strong as some animals' teeth
they just don't
a bird with a really strong beak might be able to crack that
I don't really know for sure
cause I don't know everything and I don't know everything about every kind of bird
I only know some things about some kinds of birds
oh dear I think I've forgotten what a chickadee eats
definitely eats some seeds
I think chickadees do eat insects
if I'm not mistaken
do you wanna take the nuts and play with them down on the floor
okay
do you wanna help me make some cookies
do you need to use the potty love
okay
alright
do you wanna help make cookies
okay
let's see to do that you will need definitely to wash hands
why don't you put all the nuts
let's put all the nuts in one container and save them
I think we'll save them in a good
how many are there
let's see
let's put all the nuts in a yogurt container
why don't you put them all in there and then
whoops
and then I will help you put the top on it
Daddy especially
yeah I think you are right
Mommy does too
cause it makes the food taste good
whoa
that sounds great
you made a musical instrument
you want another yogurt container
you could make two of those musical instruments
you put some more nuts in here then you could make another musical instrument
it's like a shaky a shaky yogurt container
not a shaky egg but a shaky yogurt container
whoops
here you go
you wanna put the other nuts in the other one
whoa
the top wasn't on
alright shall I help you put the top on more securely
are you making one or two of these
okay
okay
let's put all of them in then
here's some more nuts
let me see this
let me see
there try that
you know what it sounds a little different every time you put more or less nuts in it
that'll sound different
that one will sound empty I bet
but you know what might sound different if you put something really small in there like some of your beans
let's put beans in one of them and see what it sounds like
and close it close it up real tight
there
that does sound different
the nuts
nuts
who says nuts
does a squirrel say that
nuts
what did I put in here
cornmeal
whoop
oh this mixing bowl is very heavy
mixer I mean
mm
where's the butter that I just had in my hand
one two three
where's my butter
cause I just had four sticks of butter and now suddenly I only have three
I've lost my butter
what shall I do
lost my butter
what shall I do
oh Naima
oh my god I'm glad I got that on tape
you found the butter
well it's not for playing with
I didn't know you had it
it's for cooking with
it's not for playing with
does it feel interesting on your hands
you wanna build something with butter
well let's see
when we make the cookie dough I'll let you build something with cookie dough
how's that
alright
when we make the cookie dough
oh my goodness yes you did have the butter
I didn't know you had the butter
butter is food it's not actually a toy but I will
I will let you play with some cookie dough after we make the dough okay
but we need to make the dough first
you want me to help you put the top on that
oh
okay you are gonna need to pick
get on the floor and pick those up okay
no
you can put these in here first but then you need to go pick the other nuts up
I'll help you get down
and you need to put them away or play with them in the living room
I don't want them on the floor there
I'm gonna count to ten then you are gonna pick up the ones that are on the floor
do you need help getting down
I don't mind if you shake it but I want you to pick up the nuts that are spilled on the floor too
you can shake it
you can have it to shake after you pick up the other nuts
you are having Ring Around the Rosy at the dance party
here put your other nuts in there
and then I'll give you the top after you collect all your nuts
you are collecting nuts just like a squirrel does
and then I will let you help me make the cookies if you would like to
yeah this is some food that I'm picking up off the floor not the nuts
you are doing a good job picking those up Naima
there's one there
and there's some up on the table too
wanna get those
you want me to help put that on then you could shake it
okay
I guess we are gonna turn off the tape
speaking of keys where are they
Naima can you tell me what the date is today
dyou remember what we said
seventh of what month
what month is it
you remember
it's right on
yes
mhm
good job
it is January
it's definitely January
do you want to wear your slippers
are your feet cold
mm
uhhuh
oh
so you have a raincoat
oh he doesn't need a raincoat
you are gonna throw what in the stroller
hmm
the bookstore was closed that day too
did you see someone opening it with keys
do you mean Barnes and Noble
you were there so early that they hadn't even opened yet
is this warm
oh it is
he's shy about having his picture taken
yes
it's not food
are you pretending it's food
mhm
this is the microphone part is this part right here
and that back there is the transmitter in your pocket
yes
that's a very grownup thing to have in your pocket
I've got one in my pocket too
hmm hmm
mhm
you are his mommy
is his mommy hungry
does she need to eat
you could eat some grown up food
if you were hungry
does Sleepy Bear's mommy eat grown up food usually
oh she likes that
I heard you
okay
did he have his supper
oh
so he didn't have anything stinging because he didn't have any boo boos even though he ate with his hands
oh
that's good
but there's another reason not to eat with your hands
even if you don't have boo boos you might decide to eat with a fork and a spoon
you know why
because then your hands stay clean
and that's kinda nice
it means that when you are finished eating all you have to do is wipe them a little bit on a napkin
they are both shy about having their picture taken
why is that
why are they shy
is that how you have your picture taken
oh
should I bring the camera and be the person taking their picture
and they can pretend to be shy
mm okay
mhm
mm
oh what a great idea
I will bring the camera in there
and take a picture like that
oh
I'm looking for the camera
no I have
well that's a different camera Honey
you want to stand there again
I'll take a picture of you with him there
you hafta stay still and you hafta smile and you hafta ask him to smile
you gonna hold the handle of the stroller to show that you are strolling him in the picture
and can you smile
how about you
Mommy has to smile too
you are being still
okay I don't have any more
let's see
it's a good picture
you wanna see it
there it is
that's you
Sleepy Bear and his mommy
that's a nice picture
yes
oh by itself
well I have to erase some more pictures to make enough room
for me to take more pictures so you have to wait just a minute while I do that
are you gonna tell me if you need a potty Honey
would you wanna put some socks on to keep your feet warm
because it looks like maybe your feet are cold
okay
you sure
am I an obstacle course
you just leapt over my leg
you leapt over my leg
that means you leaped
leapt means leaped
it looks like you are getting toasty warm on that heating vent
I'm worried that you might be a little cold

oh the yellow part
I don't know what that's for exactly
mhm
she doesn't like having her picture taken

there's a drugstore in the mall that we go to sometimes
oh
I'm gonna check and make sure this is recording
it is recording yes
oh are you thinking about Sears where we got our picture taken once
I wondered if that's what you were thinking about
you were only there once really
well we went to check and see if they were open yet but there were a lot of people in line
that's true
you thinking trying to think of other stores in the mall you could open up or go to
you know there's a toy store in the mall
you wanna take Sleepy Bear to that toy store
I don't think you know the name of it
it's called The Learning Connection or something like that
but it's a toy store in the mall
it's the toy store where we got the felt board
I don't know if you
you probably don't remember that
it's in the mall
and there's clothing stores in the mall
there are definitely clothing stores
that's good
he doesn't need them does he because he's got fur
how about we could pretend there's a salmon store in the mall
a bear grocery store with just things that bears like
mm
hmm
how about nuts
what other kinds of nuts
what was that other kind in in addition to hazel nuts that you just mentioned
mhm
how about peanuts
peanuts are nuts too
yeah
no I know you don't
well it's one of those things
some people like some foods and other people don't
it doesn't have to do with whether you are grown up or not really
just has to do with people people liking different things
like I like chocolate and you don't
and
let's see Daddy like
oh that's a good question
what does Daddy like that I don't like
Daddy likes something called
well let's see
that's not a good example
hmm there is some things there are some things Daddy likes that I don't like
Daddy likes whole wheat halwa@sund and I don't like that very much
Daddy likes
I like most things Daddy likes actually I think
but lemme think
Daddy likes
Daddy likes to eat a lot of nuts
I like to eat nuts but I don't like them as much as Daddy does
Daddy really likes to eat nuts
hmm that's a good question
Daddy likes soy milk
and I don't like it very much
Daddy likes
what do you like Naima
that's true I don't drink nursies
I don't need nursie milk because I'm a grown up
grown ups don't drink nursie milk

she dumped the coffee grounds in the hall just like you did this morning
she did that
what did her mommy do
that's good
did she help
I see
oh is Koala's daddy
oh
is Koala Mala afraid of the noise of the vacuum cleaner just like you are Naima
oh
oh why is she afraid of that
squares
the square shape of the vacuum cleaner
oh
so if the vacuum cleaner had a round shape do you think she would still be afraid of it
oh
mm
even if it was rectangular she'd be scared
what other shapes could it have
mm
mhm
globe shaped hmm
mm
trapezoid
diamond
do you need to use the potty

someone gives him shrimp
he doesn't even pay for it
or he pays for it at the store
yes
ah

yeah yeah
your black wallet is right here
oh
oh let's see
I think it's down under here
that blue one that Dadaji gave ya
is that the one you are thinking of
well I think it might be in here though
here you go
here's your purse
you gonna put your wallet in your purse
are you leaving the house to go to the store
getting all the things you need to go
when I leave the house what's another thing I look for and I sometimes can't find do you know
my keys
sometimes I look for my keys when I need to leave the house and I can't find them
hmm
because you can walk a long ways
great
does he like to go for long walks in the stroller
oh
kind of a long walk
but if it's a sunny day that's okay
okay
okay
like that
okay
like that
he doesn't have a new what
oh pet
oh
what kinda pet would he like if he could have a pet
oh the Green Briar Nature Center
oh
oh the ones that he already has over there
what do we have over there
what kind of pets are over there
what kind of birds
is someone in there
who is it
I'll go check and see who it is
something's in here
it's a duckling
Sleepy Bear is this your duckling
oh
why is the duckling scared
oh that's nice
what are you gonna do to comfort the duckling
can't
oh
poor duckling
can't even quack
is it a little duckling
what's that duckling's name
oh yes Motorcycle Chicken
I've heard of Motorcycle Chicken
what are you gonna do
is there a veterinarian in this town
does this town have a veterinarian's office
or an animal hospital
oh
oh what do you think a duckling might have swallowed
other than grain
something really small other than grain
do you need to use the potty
I'll go with you
and we can take Sleepy Bear and show him how to use the potty
what could a duckling swallow
a duckling could swallow a key
that is
that someone left on the ground
or a duckling could swallow a coin
oh
is it stuck in the duckling's throat
oh
what do you think we should do
it turned out I was his mommy
okay
okay
by the way let's see
the new Sleepy Bear could be in the bathroom or in the
living room
should we check
oh he's right there
right in the hallway
yes I'm the person behind the counter
oh
what kind of store is this Naima
oh this is the toy store
yes we are open now and we do have some toys that little bears might like
let me
let me take out a few things I could show you and you can decide if you think your little bear would like them
we have some cups which are very nice for stacking and putting together
like that
that's good for a little toddler or a big toddler even
and another nice toy for a child is a watering can
in fact my little girl has several watering cans at home
my little girl has a green one just like this and she also has one in the shape of an elephant
so I I would recommend that as a very nice present to give your child
let's see there's something called a Magna Doodle
and you can draw on it and you can write words on it
like
what's your child's name
oh I think I will do that
Sleepy Bear s@l l@l e@l
e@l
p@l y@l Sleepy Bear
and then bear is his other part of his name
b@l
e@l
a@l
r@l
there I spelled his name
wouldja like to show this to him
bear
this part says Sleepy Bear
and this part says Sleepy Bear
yes
that's a very good question
well
doodling means to write or draw a lot of different things
some of them can be words but usually just little drawings
doodle means to draw really
okay
ah I'll beep it for you yes
beep
that's going to be five dollars
the cups are a dollar each
so that makes five
six
seven dollars is what you owe me
are you buying the watering can too
wouldjou like a little help with that
is this the toy store that
what were you asking me
oh it looks like you are buying two cups that are a dollar each
and you are also buying the Magna Doodle which is five dollars
so that's seven dollars that you owe me
five
six
seven
do you have seven dollars
okay
mm okay
oh I think those are mostly one hundred aren't they
oh do you think you have seven in there
how many do you have
oh
okay
yeah you are right
but how many of those bills do you have
on the floor
how many are on the floor
mm
well why don't you give me a couple of those and we'll pretend it's seven dollars
unless you'd like me to make you seven dollars
oh are we gonna make some money
you know we could actually get bunny money and take it downstairs to the photocopier and make money that way
with Mahatma Gandhi and
that's actually pictures of money
it's pretend money but we could do that
should we go down and do that
Chief Seattle
we could make money

Jesse Norman
Martina Navratilova
Mother Hale

Jonas Salk
Mahatma Gandhi

Fred Astaire bunny yes
Fred Astaire
oh Jane Austen
Desmond Tutu
you wanna go down and make money with the photocopier
are you a child who might like something to
oh you mean draw it with drawing
cutting construction paper
I could make you money that way
I could make it the same size as a real dollar bill
yeah
you like that idea yeah
yeah
yeah
Naima wouldja like a little supper
something to eat or snack
you heard a Daddy noise
your ears are better than mine
I hear the camera
wanna go check and see if Daddy's car is out on the side
we could do that
no

I will do that
okay
oh there's Bunny Money

making it by photocopying
let's go to the basement then
we hafta do it down there
okay

okay
let's see
could
you want the children to count the numbers that are on the white board over there
okay
because
today is the eighth of January
good job Sleepy Bear
who else can count up to eight
do any of these other children know how to count to eight
okay Motorcycle Chicken
go ahead
good
let's hide an eight
okay I guess we need to write the number eight on something then
where is the seven that we had
oh the seven's up there
let's turn it over and write eight on the back
oh we could hide that eight
we could hide the number eight that's blue next to that seven
it doesn't have to be on a piece of paper
okay can you get the seven down
the seven on the brown paper on the white board
no
above it
up on top
that seven
yeah
I will write eight on the back
and then we'll hide the eight just like at Cotuit Nursery School
if I told you I wouldn't be hiding it
we do need a pen though don't we
because you are a teacher you mean
well we let's write the eight on it and then we'll figure out about hiding it
let me see
is there any pen up here
I'm gonna go get a pen
here's a pen
oh
I'm sorry that that happened
this is not supposed to be dragged around
cmon over here
no cords actually aren't allowed
okay where's that
here's that piece of paper
shall I draw an eight
dyou wanna write the eight
dwan try writing it yourself
okay
draw a funny eight
this is a pen
you've never used a pen before
oh this pen isn't working
there we go
here is an eight
that's not the eight down there
eight
okay
let's see
where should I hide it
mm hmm
children you are not allowed to look
I'm gonna hide it somewhere where you can see it but you'll have to still look for it to see it
which child is gonna find the eight
it has to be
there
actually I want it to be right side up
hmm maybe that's not a good place
yeah that's a good place
he did
mm okay
let's teach the children about cows when you are done
well because school is a place to learn things
let's read the story about different kinds of cows
let's show them the picture of the three cows on your door
on the door to your room
let's take it down and show it to them and explain what the different kinds of cows are
you can leave the tape on if you want

okay Motorcycle Chicken
can you see Motorcycle Chicken
yes
is it time to give children their snack do you think Miss
decide
I can decide you mean
I think we should give the children their snack
well I think we should give out some pretend cookies
so let's get some pretend cookies
what do you think
is that a good idea
yeah
that's a really good idea
usually when you eat you want something to drink too
do you think these children are old enough to have cups that they can drink with both hands without a top on it like a sippy cup
oh
she's pretty old to be in nursery school
oh
oh they know how to count
should we use get some
oh you put it back
good
that's right where it belongs
after the seven and before the nine
that's where an eight belongs
the nine belongs after the eight and before the ten
January tenth
well January tenth is a special day
it's somebody's birthday
you
I'm what
can I be Mommy your mommy again for a little bit
oh
I wanted to be your mommy again
they haven't come back yet
so they still need the teachers here
do you need to use the potty
your pants are falling off of your bottom
did you notice that
why don you take those off because they are gonna come off anyway
see because they are backwards
might as well take them off
and that way when you are ready to go to the potty you'll already have your pants off
and then we are gonna go soon to go look for the new Sleepy Bear who's lost
we need to go to Cotuit to look for him
well we don't want him to stay there
I don't
I wanna find him
so we are gonna spend another five or ten minutes and then we are gonna go to find him in the car
oh
let's give him honey cookies
why don't we pretend those rocks are the cookies
we can give one to each child in the school
because cats like milk
yes they could have milk in them
they could be milk flavor cookies
oh they are not milk flavor
I see
I see
okay let's give everyone a snack then
well we don't have enough chairs
everyone's gonna hafta sit on the floor for snack

I was wondering if you were a little bit cold there

now that both arm's are in the right place
you wanna put this other arm through
you gotta pull and stretch it
yeah
there
oh what a nice red jacket
that Daddy's not gonna be cold at all
oh dear
what's happening
the velcro doesn't attach
just a sec
do you want my help
okay
I was just putting down my drink so it wouldn't spill over here
okay what is the problem with the red jacket
okay okay
do you want me to put the daddy's hands on the stroller
okay
let's see how will this go
there how's that
is that how you want it to be
hmm
it must be somewhere in there
I bet
I would look for it in here
you might see it if you take a few things out
hmm
I'm not sure where it is you know it could be somewhere else
it's a very small thing
here's a piece of clothing
that's not a back pack though is it
hmm oh wait what's this tadah
is it empty is there something in it
oh dear
you need you need help putting the back pack on
okay
I think the green part's come check okay because I can't see too well from all the way over here
oh come show me yeah
the green part yes that's the back that's the part that will go against the back of the daddy doll
mhm
oh you know where it is it's on
it's on the it's either on the table where your stable is I think
oh goodness
hi

mhm
they do
here put her hands right up like that and put one of the sleeves right over
you know what
you wanna put it this way
right
yeah
that's fine
do one arm at a time
you need to put it on inside
look look this is where her arm goes
there
you know what
can I show you
this is where her arms are gonna go inside these holes
they are not gonna go in this way that would be putting it on backwards
her arms have to go in these holes
one at a time is a good way to do it
yup
I see her other arm
there
now she's got a night gown on
is she gonna velcro up the back
it's that green one right there isn't it
and I think you put the is the mattress and the blanket over here
I think this is the mattress
and that's the blanket
the red's the blanket and that's the mattress the futon
I'm going to make a phone call
seven seven one o@l o@l nine three
o@l o@l nine three
hi I have a Eureka Mighty Might that needs a little repairing
it's actually just the part that attaches I don't know even what you call it
attaches into the main body of the vacuum
yeah the place where the hose attaches there's a tiny tiny piece of plastic that's broken off
but it may need the whole hose may therefore need replacing
do you carry all those parts or
yeah
right
that's right except that it's been a really good machine so
yeah
yeah
how long does it take to order parts usually for those
mm
that's awhile okay well if I can I will try and bring it in later
what are your hours normally
thank you very much okay byebye
mm
phooey said Mommy
you okay
oh to pretend that they are
yeah
is that gonna be Pikes with Parents
do you need some help
oh
do you want some help sweetie
no
oh dear
there seems to be a lot of unhappiness in this house
is there something you'd like to do
that would be more fun
oh
that's the swimsuit it's it is very hard
can I hold her while you put it on
would that help
you know yeah
that's not how it goes you are right
let's look at this if you were putting on your swim suit would you put your feet in first
is that how we put your swimsuit on you
okay if you hold it
I'll put her feet in
there's one foot
hey is she gonna wear these black shoes into the pool
they don't come off I know
yeah
so now she's got it on her bottom
now she just needs to get out her arms
I will hold it and what you wanna do is stretch it way out until it gets unto her shoulder like that
now her other one stretch that sleeve way out there yup
it's very stretchy fabric
oh it's like the yarn sweater
now you can velcro it up
hey
okay on this there's only been about five or ten minutes
interval between the last tape and this one
on the twenty second of January
hmm
that's my name
yes
what about the doll's stuffed animals
the daddy's gonna go to work now
oh he's gonna work down in the basement
that kind of office
the home office the office at home
okay
is it we could make that could be the basement down there
oh
hmm
okay we could try to do that
uhhuh
and that's where the office will be
oh
okay
well we could put the base plate there
and then we could build the desk and put the computer and what else is down there
in the basement
yes
yeah he has a lots of messed up papers down there that's true
okay
well we could use regular chairs for his desk chair
and we could make this this could be his desk
we could put two of these together to make his desk
like that
that's about the size of his desk and we could put a chair there
here's here's a here's a green chair
you know we could build it and then we could slide it underneath after we build it
what do you think
what else is in his office
the base plate
but while we are building it we can keep it right here if we want to
kay
what else does he have down here
the treadmill
okay
this block almost look like a treadmill if it was this way
not really
that's true it doesn't have a hold in it
hmm
the treadmill also has like two handles
doesn't it
kind of like you know to go up to the side that he holds onto I thought I would make that part
wait wait wait wait wait wait
because I thought you know like he when he walks on the treadmill
he holds on
right
yeah
and then there's a bar across them
let's get one more yellow small yellow lego
to go here
and then something goes across that he
I don't really
huh
something is wrong with this lego
so it can kinda look like the treadmill
well that's I think it looks kinda like the treadmill
then he has he has a sofa right here doesn't he
next to his desk
a pink one
do you need to use the potty
okay
let's go look
the one that's a pull out sofa that great grandma slept on when she was with us
it pulls out
and turns into a bed
yeah you know which one I mean
should we make that
you are right
could we use red instead maybe
you are right there are no pink legos
there does that kinda look like that's a sofa
that's part of the sofa
I'm pretending that's the part that you sit on and this is the back of the sofa
I'm just pretending
this is the part to lean against that's what I was thinking
and you sit like this
if the doll was there she'd be she'd sit like this
on the sofa
this is a nonfunctioning Lego
yup push
yeah push
yeah yup
watch Mommy do it
pushing
you can use your regular voice if you want help with something sweetie
Bibby would sit like that
is that Bibby
Bibby
Bibby and Bobby
mhm
would you are you interested in sitting on your bed and reading a book and having some quiet time
it might be nice
because it's kind of nap time for you
oh build a guest bedroom okay
here's a bed
how about right over here
guests sleep over here
in the guest bedroom
there's the bed
yup
there's a little table in our guest bedroom isn't there
like this table was on this side
this side
the table that holds magazines and things
and I think maybe there's even
is there a little table on this side too
yeah
alright
okay
did you see that I put the water colors and papers out for whenever you are ready
to paint with the water colors
yeah there might be just one I don't remember
if there's two or one
it's still snowing out look
you can see some snow falling still
because the lights aren't on
and it's a dark day it's not a sunny day
alright here we are
oh there are two tables see
one on that side
and one on that side
and there are two lamps too
you could do that
and there's the chair in the guest bedroom also
okay
yeah
alright
is your neck itchy
why don't you walk up the stairs
oopsie
because it's got a zipper
here hold still for a second
okay leave that there
please
you wanna unzip it all the way
okay I'll move the microphone then
okay just a second
alright
alright
you don't have to inhale it
let's go upstairs
inhale means to breathe
you looked like you were breathing in the microphone
I don't know
oh that's what you were doing
yes oh you are in luck
Naima I'm gonna check and see if there's any laundry I need doing I'll be right back
just to the washing machine
hi
hey where's your microphone
oh brother
oh Naima
alright where is it honey
on the floor okay
okay
you wanna do the painting now
because I thought that it might be easier if I give you one color and then another and then another
because that way the colors you won't get all all mixed up on the brush
which is what sometimes happens
well there's actually some water right there
and there's also some on top so there's some in there
yeah ooh
yeah of course not you can take as long as you want
thank you sweetie
you can let me know if you decide you want another color
okay
which color would you like next
purple green blue orange red
brown
you want brown okay
I'll get you brown
and then after you are done with brown you can pick out another color
there's red
he says wed with a w@l
yeah
Wodney Wat
some toddlers can't
well because even when you are a little kid you are still learning how to talk aren't ya
it's not so easy
to learn how to talk
it's a very difficult thing
yup that's another way you can do it alright
oh what color would you like next
wed or red
red
okay
let me have that brush
and I will get you the red now
do you like that Wodney Wat story
yeah
why does the title of the book say Wodney Wat instead of Rodney Rat
the title of the book uses
the way Wodney says his name
because it's about him it doesn't use
what probably his parents probably say Rodney rat right
well they aren't toddlers they probably can pronounce their r@l
properly
well grown ups usually can pronounce things
it's just that when you are little and growing up some things are hard to pronounce
it's hard to twist your mouth in that just the right way
don't you think
do you think it's hard to say some words
what words do you think it's hard to say
there's water right in there
yup the paint gets into the water and colors the water red
he does
he can't
what's in my nose or anyone's nose
hmm
there's little hairs in most people's noses
the hairs keep all the dirt out
and other things from getting up into your nose and your throat
well if you didn't have all the little hairs in your nose then you might get big pieces of dust or little pieces of dirt up in your throat
because your nose is actually connected to your throat
okay
oh
with a tail
oh
oh my
a blue ear above
blue air above oh like sky you mean
here's some black
yeah I gave you a different brush because the other one it looked like the pieces of the brush were coming out on your paper because you were banging the brush on the paper see how there's little pieces of brush on your paper
on your painting
what things are black
well sometimes the sky can look black if there's a storm coming
it's usually a very very dark grey not actually black
but at night sometimes the sky can look black
when it's nighttime
okay
the animal eats the black thing
oh
that's alright
I'll clean it up
when you are done with the painting
oh
oh the black stuff is stuff inside the animal's nose
oh
which pink part
oh
that's where its nose is
huh
uhhuh
okay
oh
hmm
oh so the sky has dark parts and blue parts
wow look at all the snow in the sky right now
my goodness
it's really snowin
you want some blue now
okay
should I take that
mhm
that's part of the sky
yeah
it's getting to be dark yeah
I think the you haven't had the green or the orange or the purple but you've had the other colors
yeah okay hold on
what do you think sometimes is
yeah
funny shaped grapes
that are not good to eat
oh that are good to eat
sometimes the sky can be purple what other things are purple
the sky can be purplish if there's a nice sunset
and some flowers are purple
let's see
let me get you the purple
are you all done with the blue
do you want me to get the purple or are you still painting with the blue
okay
do you want me to get the purple for you
when you are done with that
yup you can call them pictures or paintings
yup
well they are pictures
you could say your painting a picture or you could say your painting a painting
because painting means what you are doing but it also means what it is you painted
yeah I think that's probably what we say in this house we say you are painting a painting
or your painting a picture
I guess maybe we say both
here is the purple
sky can be purple sometimes if there is sunset
and it's more that it's purplish it's not usually bright purple
mhm
oh boy
are you done with the purple
you wanna keep the purple there and I'll give you some orange
I'll give you a separate I'll give you a different
brush for the orange so that the orange and the purple don't get all mixed together
so I'll put the orange all the way over here let me get some water for that
let's see
okay
now I'll actually move this down here since you are mostly done with the purple
now you can use the brush for the orange
oh sun
yes sometimes it is
well
usually it's part of a sunrise colors or sunset colors you can see orange
I think green is the only one you haven't had
okay
don't paint on the table please
you can use this brush for the green
can you think of anything
no
when you go outside what things do you see that are green outside
ah yes
grass
yes
would you like another piece of paper
you mean you are done painting that one
okay
wow
oh alright
do you need a little water next to the green
looks like it
here
oops a little too much
that's for me
yay
I'm gonna come look at it
do you want me to write anything on it or do you wanna just leave it without any writing on it
would you like another piece of paper
hmm
mm
yeah it needs sometime to dry
lemme get you some paper
I'm gonna get you a smaller piece this time
okay
so now you have three colors
you have orange green and purple all together there
well so that you don't mix the colors up
if you use one brush for the orange and then you use the same brush for the green
the colors will mix up and probably become some version of brown
sometimes you wanna do that but you may not wanna do that all the time
so this way you can use more than one brush
one for each color if you want to
uhhuh
ah
and what color are you finding that you make when you do that
what would you call the combination color
I was peeling carrots and slicing them
woo peeling them
no I was actually peeling them
hmm
making some lines
hmm
hmm
well when he comes home you can tell him about combining the colors
it's seems like I do get a picture almost every day you've given me one
it's very nice to have them
really
he's at work
you know those brushes really are shedding their their brush their
these aren't very good brushes
because they are just coming out
the bristles these are called the bristles
the bristles just are coming right out
are you done with this one do you want me to put it aside
do you want any writing on it
mm okay
you wanna write with a different with a pen or a crayon or something
you can write letters with paint
do you wanna try that
you can
is that what you wanna do
yeah
you are gonna do it
it says for Daddy from Naima
you mean right here
mm
hmm
yup
you want another piece of paper to make another one
okay
Naima what did I just ask you
Naima what
I'll pour some extra water how's that
you are right a tooth brush is another thing that has brushes on it
brushes like this
do you wanna ask me for some certain colors
you want a set of colors for your painting
not the same ones
okay
which ones then
I'm gonna give you the the really thick brush
you don't want the white one
Naima what colors of paint would you like for mixing colors
that's from what you painted yesterday that's dried up
I wanna get you some
remember we bought brown and yellow yesterday

hmm
oh
we'll take it all off and we'll wash it
I think you do
you haven't had one for awhile and now you do have a lot of paint on you
I think we'll wash all of you Naima
Daddy
mothers call their children babies even if they are not really babies anymore
it's kind of you know it's kind of just an expression you know that means
an expression is something that's not exactly true
but in this case it means
it's kind of like saying I love you I remember when you were a baby
you are my baby because you are my baby from the day you were born
or you are my baby ever since you were teenie and tiny
and I took care of you and did everything for you I remember doing that
when a mommy or a daddy calls a toddler or a bigger kid a baby even my mother sometimes says you know you are still my baby
oh it's just a way of saying
so when Mommy or Daddy calls you baby it's just another way of saying hey I love you
what do you think of that
I know Daddy is going to really like that picture a lot
yeah
you are done with all your painting
okay
well I'm putting them on your table first but I really need to remind you to not touch them until they are dry when they are on your little black table in the living room

oh snakes I think
yes
the people who made the paint are the ones who decided to paint the pictures on them
why do you

oh good thank you what are you going to do to make it better
ah thank you
should I give my toe toe cream every day
can you get that over my heel there
oh thank you
I'll do the rest of it
okay thank you very much doctor Lisa
I will go home now
I have an idea
we could make an animal hospital and Pushpa could be the the veterinarian instead of the farmer
and she could take care of the farm animals that the farmer brings into the veterinary hospital
yes
Veena has to walk with the animals is there a vehicle that
whoop
oh okay
it's not a farmer
okay
oh hmm let's see hmm let's examine this young calf here
is it this boo this ear or this ear
both boo boos on both ears let me see
hmm hmm hmm everything's going to be alright little calf
hmm okay I'm going to give you a prescription and I want you to put this ear cream on the calf
go get that at the pharmacy is there something wrong with your adult cow as well
oh you have a microphone injury
oh this big cow has a microphone injury hmm
where is it exactly
on the tip of the cow's ear alright
let me just examine this with my special cow otoscope
hmm yes there's a different prescription that cow needs a different kind of medicine
from the pharmacy here you go
okay
yeah
thank you for coming
I think you should call me tomorrow and let me know if the ears have gotten better after you put the ear cream on
okay
Veena put them on both
that's good
you know usually it's the farmer who brings the cows to the veterinary hospital
yeah because cows don't actually
well cows cows usually really need a human to to drive them places
I guess that's the main reason
oh they were walking yeah
oh it's close by that's why you told me
that's good
I think they are all in the chicken coop that you made
oh dear is there a chick emergency
oh what's the problem with this young
that's good yeah
well hello little chick what seems to be the trouble
oh you have a foot on the oh injury on the bottom of your foot there
let me examine this
this chick's foot here oh yes okay
let me bandage up that up a little
and I suggest that you wrap this chick in a warm blanket
for at least a couple of hours
well you'll have to find something smaller like a cloth napkin
and wrap the chicken in the cloth piece of cloth
just for a few hours to help while its while its foot is bandaged and it needs to rest
it needs to stay warm while it's injured
and then at one o'clock you can take the bandaid the blanket off
well you don't need to tape it on all I'm saying is you need to keep the chick chick warm and dry
and stop it from running around for the next few hours
well I I would suggest you try to keep it keep it nice and quiet and maybe read it a book or something
the chick doesn't like long stories I see well maybe you could read it some poetry
thank you for coming why don't you call me tomorrow and let me know if the chick's foot has gotten better or not
oh
Pushpa's over here checking the camera
oh good
I'm glad to hear that
those these cows need to go back home
bring those cows home to get better
oh dear a fox
was this fox hit by a car accidentally
hmm hmm
think that I will put some nose cream on this fox and just let it go it's a wild animal
I'm gonna let it go it should get better by itself
the nose cream
mm
let see
well it's a wild animal and I expected that that might happen
wild animals don't take directions very well
alright well that's all you are going to get
even the little bit that was on you for short while should've helped you
oh someone ate the chicken and spit it out
okay this chick needs to be in a little tiny tiny blanket is there anything we can get how about one of those blue socks on the floor over there
let's wrap the chick up in that sock
here's the chick
okay that should keep the chick nice and safe and warm for a while
yes
yes
who's saying help
mm
oh dear
Pushpa is the veterinarian
oh dear
what is Veena going to do
what do you think he's gonna do
what would he do
can you make him shout
no no no
oh dropped off
oh
oh
hmm can you take him over there
can you take him over to look for it
oh no oh no oh no
don't take our chick
don't take our chick
we'll be very upset if you take our chick
these chicks are hard to hold aren't they
Veena's upset
don't take our chick
don't take it
we want our chick back
the chick belongs with its mother the hen
ooh a funny place hmm
well all the farm animals that live on our farm belong to us but the chick belongs to its mother
it certainly belongs with its mother
I'm going to take that chick away from you
aha
ah okay okay spit out that chick please

yeah so we are just hanging out but the concert was really fun oh don't pull that
yeah it was good except they made you wait forever
my back is broken
like I hadn't been to a concert like that in so long it made me feel so old
because it was like wait in line
for like two hours because Jessica
well Jessica wanted to go early because she thought they would let you in early
at because it the thing said it starts at eight so she was like oh
well maybe we could get in at like seven or you know
so we get there at like quarter of seven and we wait in line until like seven no until like eight fifteen
and then they let us in
and then at like nine o'clock or ten after nine
then the opening act comes who was yeah who sucked
so we were so pissed we were like oh my god I I was like ready to leave I was so mad
but then she came and of course she's she made up for it because she was really good
yeah she was she did a lot of poetry it was good but the crowd it was just a it was a weird crowd
