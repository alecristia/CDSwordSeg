oh how Peter wished
he could whistle
what are those Ethan
yup bricks
he saw a boy
playing with his dog
whenever the boy whistled
the dog ran straight to him
so Peter tried and tried to whistle but
he couldn't
so instead he began to turn himself around
around and around he whirled
faster and faster
just like you do Ethan
when he stopped
everything turned
down and up and up and down and around and around
yeah the headlights are popping out
that's a those are the that's the signal
for the cars to stop and go but they are popping out
you know why
because he's
dizzy
when you spin around and around you get dizzy too
Peter saw his dog Willie coming
quick as a wink
he hid in an empty box
lying on the sidewalk
wouldn't it be funny if I whistled Peter thought
Willie would stop and look all around to see who it was
Peter tried again to whistle
but still he couldn't
so Willie just walked on
Peter got out of the box and started home
on the way home he took some colored chalks out of his pocket and
drew a long long line
look at that
he drew it right around the girls jumping rope
and still he's drawing it
joop
joop
right up to his door
he stood there and tried to whistle again
he blew until his cheeks were tired but
nothing happened
he went into his house and put on his father's old hat
to make himself feel more grown up
he looked in then to the mirror to practice whistling
still no whistle
when his mother saw what he was doing
Peter pretended that he was his father
he said I've come home early today dear is Peter here
his mother answered
why no he's outside with Willie
well I'll go out and look for them said Peter
he's pretending to be his daddy
first he walked along a crack in the sidewalk
then he tried to run away from his shadow
there's his shadow
he jumped off his shadow
but when he landed
they were together again
he came to the corner where the box was and who should he see but
Willie
Peter scrambled under the box he blew
and blew
and
suddenly out came a real whistle
Willie stopped and looked around to see who it was
it was him that's right
yup it was him
hiding under the box
it's me Peter shouted
why
it's you yes it's you
why it's me
behind a tree
it wasn't
no it wasn't
would you like to take that out of your pocket now
it was me
that's right
it was you
