this is called Winnie the Pooh and Eeyore's tail
mm
the old gray donkey Eeyore stood by himself in a thistly corner of the forest
his front feet well part his head on one side and thought about things
sometimes he thought sadly to himself why and sometimes he thought wherefore and sometimes he thought in as much as which and sometimes he didn't quite know what he was thinking about
so when Winnie the Pooh came stomping along Eeyore was very glad to be able to stop thinking for a little
in order to say how do you do in a gloomy manner to him
and how are you said Winnie the Pooh
gloomy
gloomy
Eeyore shook his head from side to side not very how he said I don't seem to have felt at all how for a long time
that is
Piglet
and here is
who's this
Kanga
and who's that
yeah
dear dear said Pooh I'm sorry about that let's have a look at you
so Eeyore stood there gazing sadly at the ground and Winnie the Pooh walked all around him once
why what's happened to your tail he said in surprise
what has happened to it said Eeyore
it isn't there
are you sure
well either a tail is there or isn't there you can't make a mistake about it and yours isn't there
then what is
nothing
well it looks like the bunny rabbit and Kanga have baskets
mhm
they are carrying baskets what do you think is in the baskets
mhm
mhm
what do you think is in the baskets
I think there may be some
or Tigger came down the tree you are right
I think there might be some picnic food in the baskets
what are the animals going to do
what are they going to do
you think they are going to eat
at at the table
hmm
they went to the hundred acre wood
yeah that's Piglet
it looks like Piglet is looking up at Pooh bear who is trying to
use a rope to get up to the door
of the owl's house
who
Pooh bear
he's using a rope to get up to into the tree
that's the owl's house I think so
looks like the owl has stairs that go into his house also
you see them
where are they yeah
mhm
mm Pooh bear can climb down them
is he gonna be careful when he climbs up the stairs
yeah there's no railing there is there
hmm I hope he's careful when he climbs up those stairs
when he climbs down them too
here's the house there's a close up of the house
hmm we need to fix this book
yeah
okay there's Pooh bear he's knocking on the owl's door
these notices had been written by Christopher Robin who was the only one in the forest who could spell
that's the door of the owl's house
yeah and there's owl coming out to see to see who's knocking at his door
mm
mm Mommy will try to fix it sometime

on the way home pa stopped at a drug store when he came out he got into a jeep
by mistake see the jeep it's a green jeep
you should be wearing your glasses pa pig
Harry and Sally thought that pa had swapped cars with a soldier
then he went to the supermarket
when he came out he got into a police car
you made a good swap Daddy said Harry but pa wasn't listening and he didn't seemed to be thinking very well either don't you agree
ha look at that police fox
he is blowing a whistle and he's saying stop
stop
that's the pig family in a police car
driving a police car
who's in back of them that's a good question
oh the police fox is chasing them that's right
and then what happens
next he drove to a fruit stand to buy some apples
when he left he took farmer fox's tractor
my but pa is absent minded isn't he

it looks as though he is very angry that means mad
with that someone who took his power shovel
does he look mad to you

Roger please be careful you are squeezing ma's little car just a little bit too tightly
well let's all hope that pa pig will never again make that many mistakes in one day
hmm
he's mad
he's bringing the pig's car back to them cause he wants to get his steam shovel
pa pig took the steam shovel by accident
it's over here
she is very surprised and looks like Loly Worm's right here in the maw of the steam shovel

that pig is worrying because the boat that he's in is about to sink
she's very surprised
the steam shovel is almost knocking her over
by accident
those are the pig children they are watching their daddy drive the steam shovel
let's see what else's in the here
these are different stories
I wanna look for a different story
oh here's a Loly Worm story okay let's go back and stick this one
the story is called the talking bread
Humper Dink the baker was mixing bread dough with the help of able baker Charlie Mouse
this little girl Flossy watch them squish and squash the dough
they are making dough for bread
you've seen me do that haven't you
yes I use a rolling pin when I make bread
that's the dough that's a lot of dough look at all the
they are kneading the dough
they patted it into loaves of all different shapes and sizes
balls yep bowls are like balls
then Humper Dink
that pig's name is Humper Dink put the uncooked loaves of bread in the hot oven to bake
that's the oven
they are putting the bread dough into the oven to bake it
okay what happens over here
after the loaves
look at all that bread on the wagon
there must be twenty loaves of bread there
after the loaves had finished baking Humper Dink set them out on the table to cool
oh here you are right on Mommy's microphone I didn't realize that
mm mm mm fresh bread smells good
Mama Humper Dink says Mama
let me just adjust this okay okay
Mama
that's what he says he's surprised
Mama
finally he took out the last loaf
listen did you hear that one when he pick that loaf it said oh it said Mama
huh but everybody knows that bread can't talk
the bread is talking Naima
it must be haunted
huh help police Humper Dink picked up Flossy and ran from the room
I must telephone Sargent Murphy he said
the bread said Mama
sergeant Murphy
that's the police dog
arrived in a hurry
he is driving the motorcycle without his shoes on and his shoes are tied to the end of the motorcycle
cause he was in such a hurry
he reached down and picked up the loaf of haunted bread
Mama
oh my goodness the bread is saying Mama
the bread is talking
Murphy was so startled he fell into the mixing trough
that's where the dough is
he fell into the dough
look at what a mess he is huh
at just that moment Huckle and Loly came into the bakery
who's gonna get him out is right I don't know who's gonna get him out
somebody had better get him out he is going to be all sticky and messy and gooey
that is a very strange loaf of bread
said Loly

if you give a pig a pancake
that pig is climbing in the kitchen door
about to eat a pancake
she wants some syrup to go with it
I think that means maple syrup right
you'll give her some of your favorite maple syrup
she'll probably get all sticky
oh look at that little pig
she's all sticky
that's like when when you drink Motrin or Tylenol and it spills and it gets very sticky
it's so she wants to take a bath
ah because she's all sticky
she'll ask you for some bubbles
that pig wants to have a bath with bubbles
when you give her the bubbles she'll probably ask you for a toy
you'll have to find your rubber duck
that girl is finding the rubber duck to give it to the pig who's taking a bath with bubbles in the bath tub
the duck will remind her of the farm where she was born she might feel homesick and want to visit her family she want you to come too she look through your closet for a suitcase
then she'll look under your bed when she's under the bed she'll find your old tap shoes
she'll try them on she'll probably need something special to wear them with that pig is making a mess
that pig is really making a mess
when she's all dressed she'll ask for some music
you'll play your very best piano piece and she'll starts dancing
then she wants you to take her picture

look at that dancing pig
so you'll have to get your camera

you have to give her some envelopes and stamps
on the way and take her to the mail box
oh they are going with a wheelbarrow full of mail to the mailbox

when the tree house is finished
she want to decorate it look the pig built a tree house
she'll ask for a wall paper and glue
when she hangs the wall paper she'll get all sticky
feeling sticky will remind her of your favorite maple syrup she'll probably ask for some
and chances are if she ask you for some syrup she'll want a pancake to go with it
