Graham wanted to take the turtle
he just wanted a turn to play with the turtle right

right
okay what's this book called
Franklin
rides a bike
Franklin could swim underwater and hit a home run
he knew how to climb the monkey bars and pump himself high on the swing
but Franklin had a problem he couldn't ride his bike without his training wheels
in the Spring all of Franklin's friends had training wheels on their bikes
Beaver was the brave one she took her extra wheels off first
she practiced and practiced then she went to the park to show off
look at me she shouted I can ride my bike all by myself
Franklin watched Beaver ride around in circles
it wasn't long before Beaver could signal with one paw and hold on to the handle bar with the other
soon everyone but Franklin could ride without training wheels
we are going on a picnic said Bear come on
Franklin was worried his friends would make fun of his training wheels so he fibbed and said I'm not hungry and went home to eat lunch alone
that's sad isn't it
yeah
what's wearing
a helmet and
a backpack right
right
that's so that if they fall down they don't hurt their heads right
just like when you go skating you wear your helmet right
yeah
afterwards Franklin asked his mother to help take the training wheels off his bike
he wanted to ride all by himself
he sat on his bike and his mother gave him a push
Franklin wibbled@wp and wobbled and teetered and tottered
and he fell into the
oh no
I can't do it he said I'm never riding this bike again
for the rest of the week Franklin felt left out
he watched as his friends rode off without him
they were becoming great explorers on their bikes
what are they on here
a bridge
that's Rabbit's bike
that is Bear's bike
oh oh my gosh Honey you are absolutely right
you are right
you know what the purple one must be Fox's
right oh my gosh you are good
I didn't even realize
right
you are right and the blue one's Bear's because Bear is big right
right
right
on Saturday Franklin's friends zoomed by his house
that looks like fun said Franklin's mother
I can't ride without my training wheels groaned Franklin
did you give it your best effort asked his mother
well said Franklin maybe I could try one more time
Franklin sat on his bike
it's tippy he cried
his mother held on to the seat try it I won't let you go until you tell me to
Franklin pedaled while his mother guided the bicycle from behind
he felt very unsteady and very unsure
I'm going to fall he said and stopped pedaling
riding a bicycle is difficult said his mother but you can't give up just because it's frustrating
it's too hard for me said Franklin it was easy for my friends
do you think everything comes easily for them she asked
Franklin had to think about that
Franklin went to the park he saw Beaver struggling to swing on the monkey bars
each time she got to the third rung she fell into the sand below
no Beaver said Bear do it like this it's easy
easy for you said Beaver she tried one more time and fell again
maybe tomorrow Beaver grumbled
did you go on the monkey bars at school yesterday
what did we do we went this one then the next one then the next one then the next one then we
then you fell
but I caught you right you didn't really fall
Franklin remembered when Beaver when Badger learned to swim she was afraid to put her head underwater
it's easy said Franklin just do it
Badger had spluttered and cried it took her a long time to feel good in the water
but now she could swim from one end of the pond to the other
I think she's swimming underwater
are you gonna swim underwater one day
yeah
with goggles like Phoebe wow that's going to be neat
Franklin thought about the first time Fox played baseball
he couldn't hit the ball at all
but he tried and tried until one day Fox got a home run
he's playing baseball
like Daddy's team right
well Rabbit's just hoping that Fox can hit the ball
he wants Fox to do well right
and he's waiting to catch the ball he's got his mitt on
and if Fox hits the ball Rabbit is gonna get ready to catch it
that would be great
right Rabbit's gonna catch that ball wow
just then Porcupine came by she moved very slowly
she pointed to the pads on her knees wrists and elbows
they make me feel funny she said but they keep me safe
that's it cried Franklin and he hurried home
Franklin put on
padding
he lined the walk with old pillows
I'm ready to try again he told his mother and now I won't worry if I fall
Franklin sat on his bike and his mother held on to the seat
Franklin wibbled@wp and wobbled and teetered and tottered and he fell many times but he never gave up
then it happened Franklin told his mother to let go
he didn't veer into the bushes and he didn't crash
way to go cheered his mother
Franklin was thrilled
finally he was riding his bike all by himself
I can do it he shouted
Franklin rode to the park to show his friends
look at me he called
Franklin tried to signal with one hand like Beaver but he toppled over I think I'll work on that he laughed
not everything is as easy as it looks
sure
sure do you want Frog and Toad
Thanksgiving book

at night we were nestled all snug in our beds
while visions of turkey legs danced in our heads
and the very next morning Thanksgiving yippee we got up and watched the parade on tv

relatives arrived from near and far
by taxi and airplane by train and by car
my brother came up the basement stairs lugging the kids' table and folding chairs
we counted and polished our best silverware
well you mean the little turkey
I think that's her hand
and then that's the napkin and then that's a little turkey napkin ring
right she's gonna put it down next to the plate right
yeah
we counted and polished our best silverware
and set the two tables with patience and care
the turkey went in and as more cousins came I laughed and I shouted and I called them by name

so up to my room my cousins they flew
we played with my toys and computer games too
they are dressing the cat up

I don't know if the cat likes to be dressed up in clothes

we made Pilgrim hats and funny shoe buckles then put on a skit for the aunts and the uncles
all were assembled except Uncle Norm
who called us to say he was stuck in a storm
meanwhile my mother was getting out yams
cranberry jelly and honey baked hams
when mom wasn't looking we stuck olives on fingers
and said they were puppets and grand opera singers

oh oh yeah oh

while dinner was cooking we played dodgeball outside
our tummies were growling can we eat yet we cried
the timer then sounded the turkey was cooked
Mom opened the oven she sniffed and she looked
when what to our watering mouths should appear
but a marvelous bird which caused us to cheer
it's a big turkey
right
its skin oh so golden the drumstick so juicy
the stuffing was fluffy thanks to Aunt Lucy
Dad slid out the bird it weighed thirty pounds
he turned and he tripped over one of our hounds
up in the air the turkey did fly
oh my gosh the turkey's flying in the air
right over the string beans
he's saying oh catch that turkey
over the string beans and straight for a pie
my brother and I made such a clatter as we leapt and caught the bird on a platter
alright said Grandpa get on with the carving
can't you see that these people are starving
Dad spoke not a word but went straight to his work
he sliced up the turkey and turned with a jerk
in front of our house we heard beeps of a horn
a trucker delivered none other than
Norm
with a wink of his eye and a twist of his head the party can start I made it Norm said
we all took our places the food smelled so great
we started to dig in but Dad said to wait
we are thankful that everyone is together this year
in our home and our hearts where we hold you so dear
that's right yummy yummy
right
we ate and we ate yet last but not least
the very next day was a leftovers feast

well why don't we read a different one
how about do you like Frog and Toad
oh how about this Frog and Toad
oh
okay let's see what we have here
should we start with spring
Frog ran up to the path to Toad's house
he knocked on the front door
there was no answer
Toad Toad shouted Frog wake up it's spring
said a voice from inside the house
Toad Toad cried Frog the sun is shining the snow is melting wake up
I'm not here said the voice
Frog walked into the house it was dark
all the shutters were closed
Toad where are you called Frog
go away said the voice from a corner of the room
Toad was lying in
oh my gosh
he had pulled all the covers over his head
Frog pushed Toad out of bed
pushed him out of the house and on to the front porch
Toad blinked in the bright sun
help said Toad I can't see anything
are you dripping on my arm Angel
a little lollipop drip
I do you are right
oh you are right maybe if you kiss it it will be better
thank you very much feels better already
mhm
but I can't see anything said Toad in the bright sun
don't be silly said Frog
what you see is the clear warm light of April
and it means we can begin a whole new year together Toad
think of it said Frog we'll skip through the meadows we'll run through the woods we'll swim in the river in the evenings we will sit right here on this front porch and count the stars
you can count them Frog said Toad I will be too tired I'm going back to
right
Toad went back into the house
he got into the bed and pulled the covers back up over his head again
but Toad cried Frog you'll miss all the fun
listen Frog said Toad how long have I been asleep
you've been asleep since November said Frog
well answered Toad a little more sleep will not hurt me
come back again and wake me up at half past May
good night Frog
but Toad said Frog I'll be lonely until then
Toad did not answer he had fallen asleep
Frog looked at Toad's calendar
the November page was still on top
so Frog tore off November tore off December January February March came to April
Frog tore off the April page too
then Frog ran back to Toad's bed
Toad wake up it's May now
what said Toad can it be May so soon
yes said Frog look at your calendar
Toad looked at the calendar and the May page was on top
why it is May said Toad and climbed out of bed
then he and Frog ran outside to see how the world was looking in the spring
wow
the story you sure know all the titles don't you
the story
one day in summer Frog was not feeling well
oh Frog you are looking quite green said Toad
but I always look green said Frog I'm a frog
well today you look very green even for a frog
he's a toad
and he's a frog

okay get into my bed and rest said Toad
Toad made Frog a cup of hot tea
Frog drank the tea and then he said tell me a story while I'm resting
alright said Toad
let me think of a story to tell you
Toad thought and thought
but he could not think of a story to tell Frog
I will go out on the front porch and walk up and down said Toad
perhaps that will help me to think of a story
Toad walked up and down on the porch for a long time
but he could not think of a story to tell Frog
then Toad went into the house and stood on his head
why are you standing on your head asked Frog
I hope that if I stand on my head it will help me to think of a story said Toad
Toad stood on his head for a long time
but he could not think of a story to tell Frog
then Toad poured a glass of water over his head
why are you pouring water over your head asked Frog
I hope that if I pour water over my head it will help me to think of a story said Toad
Toad poured many glasses of water over his head but he still could not think of a story
well chewing lollies is not good for your teeth
well you definitely can't chew without teeth but you have teeth but it's better to lick it instead of chew it
right because that could hurt your teeth
right
right and you know what if you lick it it lasts a lot longer than if you chewed it
it's true
yummy yummy yummy
that's one red tongue you have
then Toad began to bang his head against the wall
why are you banging your head against the wall asked Frog
I hope that if I bang my head against the wall hard enough it will help me think of a story
he has a headache
because he banged his head against the wall oh no
well he has a headache now he hurt his head
right
I'm feeling much better now Toad said Frog I don't think I need a story anymore
oh then you get out of bed and let me get in said Toad because I feel terrible
would you like me to tell you a story Toad
yes said Toad if you know one
once upon a time said Frog there were two good friends
a Frog and a
right
the frog was not feeling well and asked his friend the toad to tell him a story
but the toad couldn't think of a story
he walked up and down but he couldn't think of one
he stood on his head but he couldn't think of one
he poured water over his head but he still couldn't think of one and he banged his head against the wall but still could not think of a story
then the toad did not feel so well and the frog was feeling better
so the toad went to bed and the frog got up and told him a story
the end
how was that Toad said Frog
but Toad didn't answer he had fallen
right
do you wanna help Mommy make a cup of tea
what's this one called
the lost button
Toad and Frog went for a long walk
they walked across they walked in the woods and along the river
at last they went back to Toad's house
oh drat said Toad not only do my feet hurt but I have lost one of my
buttons
oh don't worry said Frog we'll go back to all the places where we walked and you will soon find your button
they walked back tall grass
here's your button cried Frog
oh that's not my button said Toad my button my button is white and that button is black
so Toad put the black button in his pocket
a sparrow flew down excuse me said the sparrow did you lose a button because I found one
well that's not my button said Toad that button has two holes and mine had four holes
Toad put the button in his pocket
they went back to the woods and looked on the dark path
here's your button said Frog
oh that's not my button cried Toad that button is small and my button was big
big but Toad put the small button in his pocket
who's that
a raccoon came out I heard you were looking for a button he said here's one that I found
well that's not my button wailed Toad that button is square and my button is round
but he put the square button in his pocket
the button yes I think it has holes
I think it has four holes but it's square instead of round
Frog and Toad went back to the river and looked for the button in the mud
here's your button said Frog
oh that's not my button shouted Toad that button is thin and my button was thick
Toad put the thin button in his pocket
he was very angry
he jumped up and down and screamed
our whole world is covered with buttons and not one of them is mine
Toad ran home and slammed the door
there on the floor he saw his white four holed big round thick button
oh said Toad it was here all the time
what a lot of trouble I have made for Frog
Toad took all the buttons out of his pocket and took his sewing box down from the shelf
then he sewed the buttons all over his jacket
the next day Toad gave his jacket to Frog
Frog thought it was beautiful
he put it on and jumped for joy
none of the buttons fell off
Toad had sewed them on very well
yay
oh my you are so drippy oh no

Toad and Frog

Toad and Frog went down to the river
what a day for a swim said Frog
yes said Toad I will go behind these rocks and put on my bathing suit
I don't wear a bathing suit said Frog
well I do said Toad and after I put on my bathing suit you must not look at me until I get into the water
why not asked Frog
because I look
I look funny in my bathing suit that's why
Frog closed his eyes when Toad came out from behind the rocks
Frog and Toad jumped in the water and swam all afternoon
Frog swam fast and made big splashes
Toad swam slowly and made smaller splashes
a turtle came along the riverbank
Frog tell that turtle to go away said Toad I don't want him to see me in my bathing suit
Frog swam over to the turtle
turtle you'll have to go away because Toad thinks he looks funny in his bathing suit and he doesn't want you to see him
some lizards were sitting nearby
does Toad really look funny in his bathing suit they asked
a snake crawled out of the grass
if Toad looks funny in his bathing suit I for one want to see him
we want to see him too said the dragonflies
me too said field mice
field mouse I haven't seen anything funny in a long time
Frog swam to Toad

yeah do you love your big girl bed
oh yes sorry
I'm sorry Toad said Frog everyone wants to see how you look
I will stay right here until they go away said Toad
the turtle and the lizards and the snake and the dragonflies and the field mouse all sat on the river bank and waited for Toad to come out of the water
oh please go away cried Frog
but no one went away
Toad was getting colder and colder
he was beginning to shiver and sneeze
I will have to get out of the water he said I'm catching
a cold
Toad climbed out of the river and the water dripped out of his bathing suit and down on to his feet
the turtle laughed the lizards laughed the snake laughed the field mouse laughed and Frog laughed
right
what are you laughing at Frog said Toad
I'm laughing because you do look funny in your bathing suit said Frog
of course I do said Toad and picked up his clothes and went home
what's this one called
oh the letter yes it's true
Toad was sitting on his front porch when Frog came along and said what's the matter Toad you look sad
yes said Toad this is my sad time of day
it's the time when I wait for the mail to come and it makes me very
very unhappy because he thinks he's get any mail right
one more chin wipe
I never get any mail said Toad
not ever asked Frog
no never said Toad
no one has ever sent me a letter
every day my mailbox is empty and that is why waiting for the mail is a sad time for me
Frog and Toad sat on the porch feeling sad together
then Frog said I have to go home now Toad there's something I must do
Frog hurried home
he found a pencil and a piece of paper
he wrote on the paper
he put the paper in an envelope and on the envelope he wrote a letter for
Toad
he ran out of his house and saw a snail that he knew
snail said Frog please take this letter to Toad's house and put it in his mailbox
sure said the snail right away
then Frog ran back to Toad's house Toad was in bed taking a nap
Toad said Frog I think you should get up and wait for the mail
no said Toad I'm tired of waiting for the mail
Toad said Frog you never know when someone may send you a letter
no I don't think anyone will ever send me a letter
Frog looked out of the window the snail was not there yet
but Toad someone might send you a letter today
don't be silly said Toad no one ever sent me a letter before and no one's going to send me a letter today
the snail was still not there
Frog why do you keep looking out of the window asked Toad
