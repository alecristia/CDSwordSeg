what are you scared of
you are scared of nursies is that so
you just want me to carry you huh
I'd like you to help me hang up the socks
I saw that you hung up the sock very nicely already
the black and white sock
you are very good at hanging the socks up
I think you did it very carefully
you wanna hang up the other sock
that one's the matching sock actually
yes
you are doing a very nice job
there's lots more socks there
oh this one fell down a little bit that's okay
here I think
you can probably figure out which ones are matching
this one this shirt I need to
yeah
that's a matching sock isn't it
and that orange one matches
can you reach it
you can what
it was in the bath tub yeah
you'll find another set of socks
another pair of socks
mhm
can I show you something
if you pull it way down
oops Mommy made that one fall
then they
then they won't fall as easily
see
I was wrong
that did fall down
what yellow things
oh those are little
looks like they used to be little plastic butter flies
that are glued to the bath tub so that
no so that a person taking a shower won't slip
it's okay they are just plastic
yes honey
are you scared
just give me a nice big hug
why are you scared
of the plastic
plastic is nothing to be scared of honey bunny
you won't have to pinch me I'll carry you
it's plastic
it won't hurt you
do you hear that
good
the camera is making noise but I also heard the church bell
I think it stopped already
that's the camera
let's hurry up and hang those things up so that we can go to the play ground
we need to hang them up first
you a little scared
do you wanna go in the living room while I finish hanging this up
yeah
you are with me
alright I'll hold you
where's your microphone
by the way
okay
I will hold you and hang up my laundry
but I would like you to know that there's nothing to be scared of with that piece of plastic
I'm not doing anything to it
it doesn't matter
nothing needs to be done with it
nothing at all
yeah plastic butterflies
that's what they are for
but you know what we don't even use this bath tub
we don't even take showers in it
do we
we just use it to hang clothes
right
you wanna touch the
plastic butterfly
wanna touch it
want Mommy to touch it
okay
Mommy will touch it
yeah I'm rubbing it
it's flat
it's almost like a piece of paper
here actually you know what it peels right off
this is it
the plastic
we could throw them in the garbage
see it's plastic
should I see if I can get the other one off
you are standing on me
let's see if I can get peel the other one off too
we don't really need to have them in here
careful boo
this one is harder to get off
do you want to
next to the toilet
you know that garbage and you lift up the lid and put the butterfly in the garbage
yeah
yeah we took it off and we
put it in the and you Naima put it in the garbage
well I tried to peel that one off I had a little trouble
because it's kinda stuck
I'm not gonna do it right now right now what I want to do is finish hanging up the laundry
you are
you smell very nice
you were but then you touched it and you put it in the garbage
you are not scared of that anymore I don't think so
yeah you know what I think that might be paint from something that you painted that was drying there
I think that's what that is
here's another sock you could hang up
this is no actually
because this is gray and that's black
you are gonna need to look here
try to find a gray sock that matches
I don't know if it
it might not even be here
let's see where's the matching one
lalie lalie nursie
you can hang that up even though we don't have the matching one right now
why don't you go and hang that up
can I show you something
okay watch me do it
I'm putting it over but then I'm gonna pull the other side
because that way it won't fall down easily
yeah that's another plastic butterfly
there's another sock
who's sock is that
that's a Daddy sock yeah
remember what I said about pulling it
here I'll get it for you
try again try again
try hanging it up again
no use your other hand
that's okay
okay put it up there
yes and then what you should do is hold onto it and then bring this down so that it hangs like that
see that way it'll stay up it won't fall down that way
I'm showing you how to hang up the sock
there's another sock
try using both hands to make it stay
like I showed you
where's your other hand
where's your other hand
nope have this hand
give me this hand
give me your hand
okay
now go behind it and find the other end
and pull it like that
see that way it hangs
where's the
where's the sock that matches

and I hope it's not raining because if it's raining then we can't go to the play ground
what
you want the umbrella to go in the rain
well but yes except that we can't go the play ground and play
with an umbrella
because an umbrella would simply get in the way of playing
I think it would
oh yeah
it is
let's check and see if it's running okay
that's the first thing we should do
that's alright we are going out of the yellow bath room

do you wanna go to the play ground
oh you don't wanna go to the play ground
okay so we are just gonna stay home

you wanna stay home
and not buy hummus
oh okay
what are you gonna eat tonight for supper then
oh you can eat cheese instead okay
well that's fine
we don't have any macaroni and cheese
I'd like to go to the play ground because I think you will have fun there

okay if you are sure that's fine
okay
oh yeah it's not green briar
I don't know what it is but it's not green briar
it doesn't even have any thorns
I don't
oh maybe it does have thorns
but it's not green briar
green briar doesn't have weeds
it's okay it's not green briar
oh everything's okay
Mommy thinks that you are scared
other thorns some plants have thorns
it's good to know which plants have thorns so you can stay away from them
but I don't think that's actually green briar
that's the thing that my microphone attaches to
that attaches to my microphone
I guess I'd call it a microphone clip
I think it's a microphone clip
everything's okay do you wanna play in the living room
okay
do you wanna get
yeah that plant
I'm gonna look at that and see if I can figure out what kind of plant that is
you know what that might
hmm
what is that
it might even be a rose
or it might be a blackberry
actually I think it's
it might be a blackberry plant or it might be a rose
rose bushes have thorns you know
they do
and roses are very nice flowers
you really need me to carry you
I'll carry you if you want me to
I wanna look at that plant
go ahead and look
I think it's a to me it looks like a

that is a little holly bush
it's called a holly bush

holly bush
it's a special bush called a holly bush
it's a small holly bush
hollies can be bushes or trees

a little later
okay here's Baby Kate Koala
okay
should we go in here
oh let's get the let's get the
camera
okay
and maybe we can go shopping after you are tired of playing
well the thing about going to the play ground is it looks like it's gonna rain
that means we really should go soon
if we are going to the play ground
because if it starts raining we can't go to the play ground
that's why I wanted you to go to the play ground now
because otherwise we might not be able to go at all
it might start raining soon
it's not raining right now but it might start raining soon
do you wanna try going to the play ground
well it's not raining right now
I'm with you
we won't go to the play ground if it starts raining
I would like to go to the play ground now but you told me you wanted to play here at home
you are gonna pretend the koala's going out in the rain
what are you doing
so that it doesn't drag on the floor
good job Naima
okay
that might be a little big for Koala Mala
you think
it might not be too big
well we'll see I guess
Kate is watching the Mommy Koala put on her rain coat
Naima's rain coat actually
let's see if we can get her to fit in this properly
she's gotta wear a rain coat you want her to play outside in the rain
I thought that's what you were telling me
I think the rain is
I just saw it somewhere I'm trying to remember where I saw it
okay
that koala is really ready to go out in the rain
let's find Naima's rain slippers
do you wanna drink of your juice
I'm gonna look for your rain in your room I think it's in your room

it's raining on the floor
what is she doing
oh she's playing on the side
with the slide
with the penguin

Koala Mala has her baby there but the baby doesn't have a rain coat
maybe we should make a rain coat for Koala baby koala Baby Kate Koala
what do you think
should we make her a rain coat
does that sound like fun Naima
we could make her a rain poncho
do you know what a rain poncho is
a rain poncho is a little bit like a jacket it also protects you from the rain

her jacket

and poop of course
of clourse
I think she is

I pull down my pants and sit myself down
then I fill the potty with my very own pee pee
good job Naima
I think you peed
yeah
you could poop too if you want
you wanna pull down that flap

mm that's the toilet paper
then
oh yep
someone older
mhm
someone
like a grown up puts the pee pee in the toilet
mhm
oop
Mommy will help you with that okay

like I've been saying
it's a good idea to always wash your hands
after you use the potty
well
after is more important than before
okay let's put soap on your hands
you know I want you to wash your hands before you touch anything
the thing is after you use the potty
you need to wash your hands before you touch anything else

and there he is riding a horse
and what's he wearing on his head
what kind of special hat is he wearing
riding the horse

you are making up a song about nursing
nursie in the cold
is that what the song is
let me take off my microphone and shut everything off and then we'll nurse

you need to get in your high chair but I need to
clean your high chair a little bit first
so you just go ahead and work on that raisin for a minute
please sit
sit properly
that's a little bowl of warm water

a stool is not a safe place to sit in funny ways
when you sit on a stool you really need to sit properly

it's very salty isn't it

when you eat salty cheese like that all by itself especially if you are really hungry that can happen
use both hands please
good job
you want juice
okay
I'll get you some
very slowly and carefully with that please
let me call
okay I'm gonna get it for you in a minute
four two eight six nine three three

how are you
I'm okay
how was your trip

yeah it was
three thirty or four
but I'd still like you to come
and
you'll
it'll just
it won't go as late as

is it hurting somewhere
where

well it doesn't look like it has a cut
is it really hurting
okay
well
it might be a cut that's hard for me to see
so I'll get some water
now
if it's hurting now from the kiwi that probably means it will hurt if you get tomato sauce on it
so I think you should try to
either use your other hand your right hand when you eat your spaghetti or you should use a spoon
or a fork
n'kay
okay
you want some more juice now
alright
you can have a little more later
I'll give it back to you

see
it's strong
do you wanna have a sippa your juice

it's a little on the chewy side
you can chew some but it's not quite ready yet
just needs another minute
I was pressing what kind of a button
on the timer
I was pressing a button on the timer
you are doing a good job not spilling very much

okay
I'm gonna take this
I'm gonna cool down the
spaghetti by putting it in the pasta
turn that off
whoa that's too much for you isn't it
I'm trying to cool down the pasta by putting it in the cold spaghetti sauce
it will make the spaghetti cool enough to eat
in the Max book that we saw at the library
I think he says zoom when he comes down the chimney
this might be hot
let's just wait a minute and see
Mommy test it and see
it's just warm
I think that's okay for you to eat
do you want some more salty cheese
or not
you want it over here or on top of your pasta
I think Mommy's gonna sit and eat with you too
is that a good spoon for what you are eating
Mommy's very very hungry too

electricity
electricity
oh you are talking
are you thinking about when we were at the center for breast feeding

we were talking about the electricity there
hmm
the electricity wasn't on
y'an a little more tomato sauce

electricity is what makes the lights go on
like this
and the camera it makes
it's what makes the camera work
and the stove
electricity is good for machines
running machines
well
like the slide that's at Daisy's playhouse
that makes all that noise
a reason it makes all that noise is because it's using electricity
sort of
mhm
that's what it's called
electricity
it's a funny word isn't it
electricity is what
you used to
if you want to use a hair dryer
or a computer
or a dishwasher
or a light
a lamp
or the television
what else uses electricity
let me see
the blender
the coffee grinder
you have to use electricity to use all those things
even that computer

he couldn't smell or hear anything that day because
cause the windows were shut I think
ooh what was it that was moving
a fat rabbit
was he chasing the rabbit
sometimes dogs like to do that
oh his collar fell off
oh that's what happened to his collar
I always wondered about that
his collar is what has something on it that says
where he lives
zoom went the rabbit through the zinnias
was he a zigzagging rabbit
he is
zoom went the rabbit through the zinnias
zinnia begins with letter Z
did you know that
that's the letter that it starts with
is he jumping up to try to get the
oh he's chasing the rabbit's legs
I think the rabbit has a hole in the ground that it's diving into
so he
he's using
Mcduff is using a lot of energy to try to
follow and chase that rabbit
yep
that's exactly right
it says Mcduff was so tired from chasing the rabbit that he laid down in someone's vegetable garden and fell asleep
what kind of a vegetable is he sleeping under
an eggplant
oh
now what is he doing

he's waking up
what does he see when he wakes up

rabbit emptying a garbage can into the back of the truck
so what kind of truck is it

and there's a dog who's also emptying some cans into the truck
hey that's a red white and blue truck with a picture of a stamp
postage stamp on it
that must be a mail truck
and this is a street sweeper

see the little camera
what a good book
which other book
you know what
we didn't buy that one
you know why we didn't buy that one
cause you put it back
you put it back at the store
we did get
we did get another book at the store but that
we didn't get that one
cause you were very upset at the store
you wanted to put the books back remember
well why did you want to put them back
did you like reading that book
well aren't you glad we brought it home now
yeah so at the time you were upset about buying the books but now are you glad we bought the books
yeah
and we have another book too
you want me to get it
okay
we'll get that one
this one is called Dinosaurs Beware
nkay called Dinosaurs Beware
look at all these dinosaurs
what are they doing
it is
what's that dinosaur doing
and look he has roller skates on
but he has three cause he has one on each foot and then there's one attached to his tail
one two three
yeah
and he's
got some headphones on
I think that means that he's listening to music
ooh
I think this is a book where lots of things are going to happen
huh
at home don't play with matches
whoa
he's throwing the matches over here and he's lighting his presents on fire
keep toys off the stairs
why do you think it's good to keep toys off the stairs
he tripped over some toys that were on the stairs and now he's falling
never play with electric sockets and plugs
they can shock you
see
it's hurting him
he put his tail into that and it's making him hurt
keep a list of important phone numbers handy in case of an emergency
what's happening in the kitchen
what do you see
what's going on
what do you think it is
what's a blue liquid
what kind of liquid is blue
yes
yes
in the kitchen
do you know what his floaty says
it says floatosaurus@wp
I think something was wrong with pipes and there's too much water in the kitchen
what's the cat doing
it is sitting on top of the freezer
I think a pipe broke and probably
the
a lots of the pipe and the kitchen is flooded
this is called a flood
when
when water
yeah
well he's not paying attention to what he's doing
he's lighting the candles on his birthday cake
and he throws them off on the side
he doesn't realize that he's putting all his presents on fire
that's not good
that's dangerous
what's this dinosaur doing now
what is that
is that a phone
it is
it's a phone on the wall
like that phone
there's a phone on that wall
floating in a floaty and dialing for help
probly dialing
y'know what
I bet she's dialing the fire department
cause if there's a flood
the fire department is one place you could call to help you get rid of the flood
this is a flood when water goes where it's not supposed to go and there's a lot of it
that's called a flood
that's just what it's called
look the milk is floating
there's the dinosaur's tail
looks like she was cooking some peas
cause the pan of peas is floating in the flood
let's see what else we have here
a hot stove or heater can burn you
don't touch either one
don't bang on glass doors or windows
oh look she banged on it and it broke
don't tell strangers who phone that you are home alone
just say hello and ask them to leave a message
well you are not gonna be home alone Sweetie
you don't even have to worry about that
dino phone
never play with things stored under sinks or in medicine cabinets
they can make you very sick
oh
never play with things under sinks or in medicine cabinets
cause they are not toys and they are not to be eaten at all
they make you really sick
they make you throw up
cause
they are bad for you
it's not for toddlers
or dinosaurs
it's just a rule that's why
it's just a rule because it's a rule
oh she's getting burned
she's touching the stove
if an adult isn't home don't let strangers into the house
tell them to come back later
mm
always put tools back where they belong
oh yeah if you trip on tools
sometimes tools are sharp
it can really hurt
I don't know
don't climb on thin branches
thin branches can break
cause they are thin
during a thunderstorm stay out of water and away from trees
lightning often strikes in both places
she's in her kiddie pool
to get cool
to have fun
she's got a shovel and a bucket too
and a boat
is that a bathing suit
do dinosaurs need bathing suits
mhm
what's the question
why does she have a shovel and a bucket
I bet she is
yeah
that's a good question
maybe that
Spinosaurus
during meals chew well before swallowing
look at this
he swallowed the fish without chewing it
and now his neck is shaped like a fish
see that picture
that's not good
you need to chew a lot when
before you swallow your food
don't lean too
don't lean back too far in your chair
she leaned back and
oh a big mess is happening
pay attention when using a sharp knife
well
that dinosaur was talking to another dinosaur
while he was using a knife to slice this orange
but he kept talking and he didn't realize he sliced the toaster in half also
oh no
by accident
cause he wasn't paying attention
cause he was looking at someone else and talking to someone else
if you have a knife in your hand you can't do that
you have to look at the knife and be very careful with what you are doing
don't gulp hot foods
taste them slowly
you know about that
that dinosaur's mouth is hurting because he ate something that was too hot
I don't mean hot and spicy I mean hot temperaturewise
I don't know
this green soup
was too hot
this looks like a good book
well
I think right now I'm gonna do some more cleaning up in the kitchen
you could
you could read it
or you
you wanna have your bears do a craft
are you hungry

Gospal in the hospital
okay
I did
I put a new batch of laundry in
I think he's done pooping
he's done so he's just gonna sit in my lap and read
well when you put yours in the potty you can pretend you put his in too
hmm oh that must be the hospital building
that's what that is
mm what's that
where
yeah
and what's that
here's it is kind of it's a helicopter that works like an ambulance it also brings people to the hospital but brings them in the air
Gospal in the hospital
last year I was Gospal the dog walker
when our neighbors went on vacation I walked their dogs
and guess what I bought with the money they gave me
a key chain with a little
what
race car yes
what's this thing
a ramp
hmm I thought it might be Gospal's shadow
well it's it's got a little key chain with a race car attached to it
yeah
ramps don't have ears so it must be his shadow
every one at school wanted it but it was mine
I was scared that some one would steal it well I'm not dumb I knew a perfect place to hide it I put the key chain in my
mouth oh oh
what happens to him
he does
what do you think the teacher is trying to do
what blue thing
that's the bench that they are sitting on
what do you think the teacher is trying to do
because because he's sick
he swallowed something
oh dear
the teacher called an ambulance
there it is
the ambulance people put me on a stretcher they asked me what happen but I still didn't want to tell
oh see they don't know he swallowed his key chain
they just know that he's very sick
it was a little hard to explain why I put a key chain in my mouth
I hope that you never do anything like that it'll be very bad for you they took me to the hospital what do you see in the hospital here
mhm
what do you think that is
not the red thing see this white thing it's in the room
that's the special water going into patient's body
you had some special water going into your body when you were in the hospital remember
okay what happens next I had a big room all to myself
the nurse took off my scarf and put a white gown on me
don't worry she said we'll take a good care of you it wouldn't hurt
but I was still little scared specially when she took me to the x ray room
do you remember getting x rays
you might not remember you did get x rays couple of times
that's his x ray and that shows the key chain right in his belly right there
poor little guy ah
the doctors asked him to count to ten of course I said
can you count
one
two
three
I'm reading the story
I fell sleep after counting to three and dreamed I was a race car driver
they were right I didn't feel a thing when I woke up it was already night
my parents were right there and Mom gave me a great big
I think you are right
inside was a race car so big I would never be able to swallow it
that's the end of the story
again
yeah
I think you might be finished on the potty there
you do
did you do more poop in there
can I look
you just want me to read the book more but I'll read the book more after you get off the potty
oh boy
maybe we should call Daddy and see if he's coming home
well he wasn't stung by the yellow jackets and that's a good thing because he said he was allergic
why don't we give Daddy a call
you wanna take off that sticker
that's the price sticker
that's to tell people how much the book cost
you need your hair elastic fixed
well that you took off the whole sticker
that's not a sticker that's the that's printed on the book
hey do you wanna try to start ah making a new bedtime poster tonight
we could do that
yeah you took all the things off of it though so we need to make a new one that says what what we do at night time
alright one more time and then I think you done on the potty
I don't think you are peeing or pooping are you
ah all this is is the title of the book Gospal in the hospital
last summer I was Gospal the dog dog walker when our neighbors went on vacation I walked their dogs
and guess what I bought with the money they gave me
did he buy dog food
no did he buy did he buy a Chompo bar
hmm did he
did he buy a tricycle
oh a key chain with a little race car
everyone at school wanted it but it was mine
he's in school he's an animal who goes to school
I was scared that someone would steal it well I'm not dumb I knew the perfect place to hide it I put the key chain in my mouth
but gulp oh no I swallowed it
I think he did gulp it
oh my god
oh you think he chewed it
oh maybe he did he definitely swelled though
suddenly I felt very sick
he really doesn't feel well
what happened Gospal said the teacher but I didn't answer I was afraid to tell her about my key chain
I think he's may be embarrassed
well he wishes he hadn't swallowed the key chain
she called an ambulance
the ambulance put me on a stretcher
this is the stretcher
they asked me what happened but I still didn't want to tell
it was a little hard to explain why I put a key chain in my mouth
well that's a good question I don't know I guess may be he thought the other children liked it very much
they took me to the hospital oh those are the ambulance people
see there he's on the stretcher they are carrying him in
ah let see
this is the special water
it's a i v fluid
called i v fluid it's also called special water it's something that goes for some people when they are in the hospital they need to get it
that's a patient
that's the patient's bed
yes I think you are right
the people who go to the hospital usually are sick
mm
I was a little scared that's what this page says
they saw what I swallowed
well it's no fun to be in the hospital
they said you wouldn't feel a thing you'll be sleep they gonna go in and take the key chain out of his belly
I fell asleep after counting to three and dreamed I was a race car driver
they were right I didn't feel a thing when I woke up it was already night
my parents were right there what's that
it's a great big package
it could be a bath tub
do you think it's a bath tub
it could be an apple tree
do you think it's an apple tree
you are probably right
it could be ten pairs of pants
it was a race car
what a nice present from his parents that's the end of the story
and I think it's time

just look at Mommy face Mommy I'm gonna put it on your back
this is the way you were in the backpack when you went to Kawadee Head
well I'm gonna

he needs to be more upright so he can see everything
okay
let's see
oh that's perfect I think he's looking forward to hiking
I think Griz is in the kitchen sitting in a chair let's go in 'cause I wanna start my water anyway
so you are hiking at Kawadee Head do you like it here
what are the kinds of things you can see at Kawadee Head
what's Griz gonna do at Kawadee Head
well he could find bear caves in the along the trail
oh what's the matter sweet heart
oh dear
yes
oh that's great should we go get some of those rocks
let's get some of the rocks for him
Griz got some at Blueberry Hill
oh gee I'm not sure I know which ones those are
but I know where there are some rocks
hmm
I think this would be make some very nice water for Kawadee Head
you get the rocks and
did you step on a lego or something
here are the rocks
okay Griz do you like throwing them
oh where's the backpack
the raccoon got out of it
oh is that why the raccoon got out
I see
ah
oh good
let's put your backpack on because you know what you are carrying your picnic lunch in it
you are on a hike you were on a hike to Kawadee Head and you need to still carry your lunch
well let's just pretend
really
where'r you gonna push Griz to on his very fun ride
oh does Kawadee Head have a play ground
oh the play ground with a bear walk
oh I'm trying to remember which one that is
oh I know where you mean
the I know the bear walk one where we took your shoes off
that was the Machias play ground
school play ground at Machias
yes we took your shoes off and it was a bear walk and it went up too
it was like bear walking up a hill
that was in Lubec that play ground
okay
meanwhile he's gonna find the doll
oh boy does he know that or is it going to be a surprise
oh Griz you are in for some fun that's such a great play ground
the main where we heard the hurdy gurdy
that was in Lubeck also
that was at a little shop a little actually a little art gallery and there was a hurdy gurdy man and a hurdy gurdy woman playing hurdy gurdies
nice musical instrument
you think Griz would like to listen to that music
great
oh
I'm going to come back and listen after I make my tea I hear the water boiling
mm
the raccoon plays the hurdy gurdy
wow
I can't wait to hear it I'm gonna come listen in just a minute
Naima we might go in a little while and bring shoes back to her
well I think we will
I'm not sure if we are gonna see her though that's the only thing
'cause she went somewhere to visit her cousins today
and I don't know if she'll be back
by the time we go
I think we'll go in about a half an hour
go and bring her shoes back
'cause I'm
because I'm sure she'll want her shoes
well they are her new shoes I don't think she's even worn them very much
she went out in the boots that you borrowed
I mean that you gave her
those are her boots now
'cause they were too small for you you've got
you've got bigger feet than she has
oh they are not very small but they are smaller than yours and they just fit those boots perfectly
would you like a raisin
mm
okay let's go hear that hurdy gurdy playing raccoon
I can't wait to hear it
I'm listening
oh my goodness
my clog is the hurdy gurdy
that's a beautiful black hurdy gurdy you've got there raccoon
are you turning the handle raccoon
do you remember the hurdy gurdies had handles that you turn
Griz is going to swim in the water
let's see how he swims
mm
are you gonna show him or does he already know
really
wow
woo look at you go
you guys are swimming together aren't you
I can just barely hear it
what does it sound like
you mean it sounds like the church bells
it was barely what ing
the red bell
on the floor right there
you mean your little bells
right there
next to the yellow chair on the floor the lego chair
near the helicopter yep
oh you are playing faith and our fathers on that
on the bell
he's scared of them
are you going to comfort him
no
you are gonna let him be scared
what did he swallow
hmm
did he swallow a shoe
he did
oh my gosh
that poor bear
oh
oh
what should we do
oh it was dark outside
oh and then is he having the snack of blueberries when he's home
blueberries in the car I bet that makes a big mess
you think so
the big vacuum cleaner not even the Dust Buster
you need to use the regular vacuum cleaner
to vacuum out the mess in the car
oh he must be a very little bear to make such a big mess
only little kids make really big messes
'cause big kids know how to be a little neater and clean up after themselves and they big kids don't drop their blueberries all over the place
because they know that it's good to put them right in your mouth
guhmuh what does that mean
he was
ooh y'alright

hello stranger friend I am Tondie a Nibilay girl in south Africa
I'm eight years old and my best friend look at all the necklaces she's wearing
and she has a head necklace around her head too
I'm eight years old and my best friend is a chicken

isn't that nice
you could wear a head band if you wanned too
and what's she holding there
chicken
you may laugh at that but when I tell my friend secret she can talk all she wants but no one can understand her except another chicken of course my chicken not only listens to my stories she has other uses if you play with her and take her mind off of what's going on you can quickly very quickly snatch a feather or two when she's distracted she doesn't notice and feathers come in handy later of course
I have two hopes one is my name Tondie which means hope in my language
did you know she speaks a different language Naima
Nibilay girls are named hope many Nibilay girls are named hope
the other hope I have is that at the end of this book I can say goodbye friend not goodbye stranger friend
here she's wearing a different necklace
