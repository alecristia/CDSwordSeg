the tale of two bad mice

once upon a time there was a very beautiful doll house
it was red brick with white windows and it had real muslin curtains and a front door and a chimney
what does your house have Naima
yes we do have a chimney

it belonged to two dolls named Lucinda and Jane
at least it belonged to Lucinda but she never ordered meals
Jane was the cook
but she never did any cooking because the dinner had been bought ready made in a box full of shavings
there were two red lobsters and a ham
a fish a pudding and some pears and oranges
they would not come off the plates but they were extremely beautiful
this is describing some toy food
one morning Lucinda and Jane had gone out for a drive in the dolls perambulator
which is another name for stroller
there was no one in the nursery and it was very quiet
presently there was a little scuffling scratching noise
in a corner near the fireplace where there was a hole under the skirting board
Tom Thumb put out his head for a moment and then popped it in again
Tom Thumb was a mouse
this is a story about mice
d'you want me to keep reading
a minute afterwards Hunka Munka his wife put out her head too
and when she saw that there was no one in the nursery she ventured out on the oil cloth under the coal box
the dolls' house stood at the other side of the fireplace
Tom Thumb and Hunka Munka went cautiously across the hearth rug
they pushed the front door
it was not fast
Tom Thumb and Hunka Munka went upstairs and peeped into the dining room
then they squeaked with joy
squeak
such a lovely dinner was laid out upon the table
there were tin spoons and lead knives and forks and two dolly chairs all so convenient
look they are eating
Tom Thumb set to work at once to carve the ham
it was a beautiful shiny yellow streaked with red
the knife crumpled up and hurt him
he put his finger in his mouth
it is not boiled enough it is hard
you have a try Hunka Munka
Hunka Munka stood up on her chair and chopped at the ham with another lead knife
it's as hard as the hams at the cheese monger's
said Hunka Munka
Hunka Munka isn't that a funny name
the ham broke off the plate with a jerk and rolled under the table
let it alone
said Tom Thumb
give me some fish Hunka Munka
Hunka Munka tried every tin spoon in turn the fish was glued to the dish
then Tom Thumb lost his temper he put the ham in the middle of the floor and hit it with the tongs
and with the shovel the shovel
bang bang smash smash
d'you still want me to keep reading

here's a lantern cupboard
Big Bear can get lanterns out of the big lantern cupboard if he needs them
there's a small one a bigger one and then there's the biggest one of them all
should we have Griz be a big bear

let's see
what's happening there
Big Bear is reading
the bear book

that's such a big bed Griz

we've had this book for a long time
come sit up here
oh I remember there was something funny you used to say when we read this book
let's see I don't know quite how this would work here
you used to say
Mommy
when we used to read this book together
there's a certain page were you used to say
Mommy
okay sometimes Pippo gets lost and Tom has to look for him
where is he Naima
what's in the book
what do you see in this picture
all his toys are all over his floor
right
he
he needs to clean up I think
doesn't he
hmm
yeah that's a tennis racket
I see a train train also
okay
Tom asks Mommy if she has seen Pippo and she says Tom should look in his toy chest again
Pippo isn't there but Tom finds Pippo's scarf
looks like the elephant in the toy chest has a an undershirt on
see
and I see a clown
do you see the clown too
Daddy says did you look under your bed
but Tom only finds Pippo's hat
Tom gets really worried about Pippo and thinks he might never see him again
what is he saying
that's what you used to say when you were a baby
that's where you used to say
Mommy
Naima is very congested
you can probably hear that
even Mommy is congested
hmm it's nice to sit and read books when you are sick
isn't it
Mommy says that Pippo can't be far away and that they should look in the living room and that's where Pippo has been all the time
in the
bookcase
one more page
Tom tells Pippo to let him know before he goes away next time
do you wanna do the dinosaur sticker book that I put at the bottom of the bed
and I also put the magnets there
I mean the magnet boards
should we do the
play with those together
come back over here and we'll play with them
yeah we'll just bring it over
what
transmitter
come here twansmitter
the transmitter was kind of
in your way huh
let's see here
transmitter
it's a kind of a machine actually
which one do you wanna look at you wanna look at the dinosaur sticker book or the magnetic beach or the magnetic
construction site
do we have any magnets in here
huh we don't
let's see are any of them
hey
she's surfing on a surfboard
you know this is a surfboard it's something that you use to ride in the water
she's balancing on it and the board which is shaped like this floats on the water
it's like a
it's a thing to ride on a surf board
and let's see what else do we have here
this boy is also on a surf board
are they surfing together
they are surfing on the sand now
here's the lifeguard
I think most of the magnets are actually in the car
how about a dump truck do we ever see a dump truck at the beach
we did see a
something like this at the beach once do you remember it was making the sand nice and clean and flat
and there's a radio
how many sand pipers do you see
at the beach
do you see any sand pipers
four
try again
one
two
three
how many dolphins do you see jumping out of the water
right there are two dolphins jumping out of the water
when we were at Craigville beach
we saw a I don't know what you call it a special kind of truck for beaches
it was actually it was scooping up the sand in this part of it
and then it was putting it through like a sieve almost and it was taking all the garbage out of the sand and also flattening the sand
it was kinda like a road roller for the beach
do you remember that
that was one time when we were at Craigville beach
there's a car is there a truck at the beach today
this is a pickup truck
you know there might be a couple of other beach magnets in your room
somewhere although I don't know where exactly
on a surf board
because it's a fun way to ride see you can make them ride
wee she's riding the waves on a surf board
here's the
the life the lifeguard watches people who are in the water and makes sure they are safe
is she riding the waves
I didn't bring the tissues very close
ooh
toward the lifeguard
what's this magnet
oh that's the radio magnet
what
the other kid
oh here
that magnet's in the living room
do you know where
where in the living room
you've seen it there
hmm
I think most of the magnets are actually in the car in that box that's in the backseat
well because this was something that you were playing with a lot in the car
we could go and get them
if you wanna play with them
this one
okay
climb on board and get to town
there's some trucks there
that truck
this is
this machine
this smashes things see this thing
this thing smashes concrete
smash smash smash
and this
can scoop up the gravel
like that
I think that's a building that's being built there
see this is gonna be the second floor of the building and this might be the first floor of the building
and this is the second floor of the building
and this is the floor
and pretty soon they'll build walls
around all four sides
one two three four
they are going to build four walls
one along this edge
one along this edge
one along this edge
and one along this edge and then it will be a building
did you know that buildings usually have
a regular building usually has four walls
if it's square
that's a square isn't it
or maybe it's a rectangle
I think that's more like a rectangle
now Mommy has to get herself some tissue
can you sit up for a sec
Naima do you wanna have some more smoothie or some juice maybe
you could have a sippy cup or a bottle of juice
you wanna nurse again
I don't think there's any milk left
I think the milk
Mommy's nursies have to make more milk
oops
oh
microphone yeah
let's see if we can do that for a minute
you wanna take a little nap
you are snuggling right there
ah
you decided to snuggle right down
it's good to rest when you are sick
hmm
you are not hungry
in
the one in the living room you were talking about
we could go to the car and get the other ones too
you got it
oh is that the dolphins
or is that a different one
oh good for you Naima
you were right
I dunno where you found that
here you wanna put them in there
do you need to blow your nose with a tissue
you were doing good job being a camel before
the lifeguard is in the water
the lifeguard's chair is in the water too
the dolphins are jumping over the lifeguard's head
that's kinda silly isn't it
oh everyone's on top of the lifeguard now
I wanna be a lifeguard
life life life life I
wanna save your life
that's a song that Mommy remembers from
a long time ago
I believe that that is a song by Johnathan Richmond and the modern lovers
I've never seen a lifeguard
floating on his chair in the water like that
that's very startling
do you want me to go to the car and get the other beach stickers
what happened to this
this was in your pocket
I don't mean stickers I mean the magnets
do you want them
okay
I think I might put my clothes on while I'm at it
and then go out to the car I guess I'm not gonna take a shower for awhile
okay
ho ho ho ho
alright
what looks like Naima
does
is there a child that looks like Naima
hmm
let me just put some clothes on
and then we'll go get those out of the
who used to make it do that
wig a dig dig and away we go
what do you see outside
do you see any birds at the feeder
yeah
yeah
yeah
hi little tiny baby that came out of her mama's belly
she's crying just like a baby
yes those are nursies in my bra
hi honey
why you pushing me
yes
yep
oh you know what we should probably do
oh except your tired
we should go to the store and buy
garbage bags and we should buy eggs so that we can eat eggs today
you don't
I'm gonna wash my face
well that's some face cream for Mommy
yep okay come off the stool
let's put some socks and shoes on you and we can go out to the car and look for the magnets
I think we might actually need something to carry them back in here with don't you think
you are gonna bring them in here and play with them
where's the one who looks like Naima
is there a magnet
with a picture of a child that looks like Naima
it's what
it's walking
the child
you wanna stay in the house while I get them
I don't think I'm gonna carry you out to the car
oh you can stay here you know it if you are not gonnna put your shoes and socks on
you can stay in the doorway while I go and get them
you can't come out without shoes and socks on
and I'm not gonna carry you
it'll just take a minute
oh is it raining out
it actually is raining a little tiny bit
you stay there
and I'll get the magnets
especially because it's raining
Naima stay in the house
Naima
stay in the house please
I'll be right there
here's the magnets
oh which book is that
oh you wanna match the letters
that's a great idea
the name of the book
which letters
do you wanna use the magnetic letters or the block letters
are there letter stickers in that book
you mean these letters you wanna match
okay
I don't remember that there
oh right right right I know what you are talking about
the words that are in blue
okay we could do that
there was lots to do Arthur gave Kate a ride in a little fire truck
the words fire truck are in blue
so can you find any pictures of a fire truck
in the page of stickers
I don't see a fire truck there
hmm
maybe some stickers are missing
okay
alright well I don't see the fire truck that one is missing
because I haven't found that one
I think maybe you used the stickers for something else
let's see this is apples or strawberries right
that's the word puppy in blue and I see a sticker that has
Pal the puppy here
puppy
p@l u@l p@l p@l y@l
for example this does not belong here
and there's shoes I bet there's a blue word shoes somewhere let's look for a blue word because there's a pair of shoes
hmm
that's the word shoes
s@l h@l o@l e@l s@l you can put those right on that word
yep
back at the street fair the clown with balloons tripped over his big floppy shoes
crash down he went
and as he fell he let go of his balloons
then guess what a little brown puppy jumped up and grabbed the balloon strings
that's in blue
with his teeth that's also in blue
do we have a sticker that has strings or teeth
I see teeth
a teeth sticker
do you see it
we need a tissue
ooh you see the teeth sticker
no actually these are the teeth look
that's a teeth sticker
oh where's that word
teeth
what letter do you think teeth begins with
what letter do you think that is
yes t@l very good
there you go
that's where teeth is and it does begin with letter t@l
okay let's look for another word
that
that is in blue
let's see
start at the back this time
that's the word one
the number one
and that's the number
that's the
ah word red
well I don't know
I don't see a sticker that has
maybe
yeah maybe it's somewhere else
you did
okay
I'll just look through the book and see if there's any stickers that are
there's the number one
see
that goes on the word one
and the sentence is when he got home he still had one beautiful red balloon
very good Naima
one
hey
is that an Arthur sticker
oh my gosh
you put it right on top of Arthur
let's find more blue words
some of them we've already done
red we are still looking for something that's red
all the blue words are covered up already there
we need strings
somewhere there's a sticker that should be a picture of strings
hmm
hmm
oh there's lots of blue words here
Arthur passed the ring toss table
I think there's a picture of a ring right
didn't I find that
here we go
what letter do you think that word begins with
ring
ring
can you guess
very good r@l
that's where the word ring is
see there's a lower case r@l that starts the word
put the ring right there
r@l i@l n@l g@l
ring
let's see what else
oh
yeah I think actually a bunch of these things go there
Arthur passed the ring toss table
yep
and there's the word table
right there
and there's a sticker for table
table
can you find the word again
great
Arthur passed the ring toss table
the bob for apples table
the word apples is in blue
apple
do you know what letter that begins with
apple
ah
very good Naima right there
that's where the word apples is
and you are right it begins with a@l
and a table with pumpkin pies
that word
that's actually two words pumpkin pies
but there's only one sticker do you see a picture of pumpkin pies
I don't think you've ever seen pumpkin pie
that's what it looks like
and take this
okay put it right on the pumpkin pies
pumpkin pies
what word begins with p@l
yeah
right here see
pumpkin pies
good
chocolate cakes and cookies
are the cakes
pictures of cakes
and the word
what letter do you think cakes begins with
that's a very good guess
because both c@l and k@l make the sound kuh
but for cakes it's actually c@l not k@l
see that begins with letter c@l
that's the word cakes
but you are right kuh sometimes is made by letter k@l
let's see
what else do we want here
yeah I've
see these stickers we could probably put them where they belong instead
hey and I see the color red which was on that page where the balloon is
hold on to this sticker
and I tape it off and give it to you
okay do you remember there was a page
where the color red
yes
what letter do you think red begins with
very good Naima
let's see
and there was something about an ice cream cone
right
hmm
cone
right there
that word down there is cone
cone begins with C too
this is a little
train
truck
you are right I said the wrong thing didn't I
okay
I'm looking to see if there are any other blue words
I think mostly we are done with that part
because I think we've
fire truck
oh maybe that's is that a fire truck
but that's a green truck
that's not a fire truck
hmm
you know what we could put these other stickers on a plain piece of paper and we could write a story and use the stickers
would you like to do that
okay
well this isn't part of the story
I can read the story if you want
alright
Arthur's Lost Puppy
what's that noise
Arthur and D W took baby Kate to the street fair
Pal came along too
there was lots to do
Arthur gave Kate a ride in a little fire truck
that went around and around
D W got her face painted
look Kate she said
I'm a cat
but Kate was looking at something else
suddenly Kate began to cry
are you hungry asked Arthur
here's your bottle
but Kate did not want her bottle
wa wa wa she cried
do you have a wet diaper asked D W
but Kate's diaper was dry
and still she cried
wa wa wa
Arthur lifted the baby from her stroller
he rocked her in his arms
he tickled her tummy
he made funny faces but still she cried
wa wa wa
Kate loves ice cream says Arthur
run to the store D W
and get a
get her a cone
because these are stickers that don't really belong here
we can use them for something else
let's see
D W tied Pal's leash to a bench
and went into the store
a clown with balloons walked by
Pal barked at him
woof woof woof
when D W came out of the store Pal was gone
she looked up and down the street
that dog is trouble
she cried
and she ran to tell Arthur
oh no cried Arthur why would Pal run away
maybe he's mad at you said D W
you yelled at him today for chewing your slippers
Arthur said nothing
he just looked very sad
but Kate had a lot to say
wa wa wa wa she cried
then Arthur said D W take Kate home maybe she needs a doctor
and I need to find Pal he began calling
here Pal here Pal
here Pal here Pal
Arthur passed the ring toss table the bob for apples table and a table with pumpkin pies chocolate cakes and cookies
he wished there was a table with hamburgers
Pal would be sure to be hanging around it
have you seen a lost puppy Arthur asked the police officer
a lost puppy said the officer
yes one was taken to the
is that the police station
to the school
let me see
yep
one was taken to the school
oh thank you said Arthur and he ran to the school
but the lost puppy was not Pal
Arthur sadly walked home
back at the street fair the clown with the balloons tripped over his big floppy shoes
crash
down he went
and as he fell he let go of his balloons
then
guess what
a little brown puppy jumped up and grabbed the balloon strings with his teeth
do you wanna blow your nose
the balloons rose higher and higher
over the
roofs
over the
trees and up up up they went
and so did Pal
look someone shouted
a flying puppy
a flying puppy
do puppies have wings Naima
what has wings
puppies do
puppies don't
you wanna nurse
okay
and
then suddenly bang pop bang the balloons hit a tall tree
one by one they burst
Pal floated slowly down
when he got home he still had one beautiful red balloon
and one was all he needed
to make baby Kate happy
oh my pumpkin
yeah okay
is that a good snack you are having
is it yummy
would you like some fresh banana too
okay
you could have some plain yogurt if you want
yeah
okay
the men on Zoboomafoo
I think they call him Zaab as a nickname
because his full name is Zaaboo
and Zaab is like a nickname
you gonna have this yogurt
you want anything with it
you could have a little banana
you could
alright
hmm
more blueberries
and wheat germ
you want the kind in the red container
hmm
let's see and I'm gonna drink some juice
because juice is a good thing to drink when you have a
cold
would you also like some apple juice
in a sippy cup or in a bottle
yes or no
okay
I will give you some water
what
oh
I know exactly what you are talking about and there's a picture of
a boy peeing standing up that way too in the book
mhm
that's the picture you are talking about in the potty book
yep sometimes boys and men can stand up to pee
and they don't have to wipe their bottoms
and you've seen
you've seen Daddy do that when he takes you to the Y M C A for swim class
what friend is behind the tissue box
oh it's Mr Grizz
it's Mr Grizz
do you need more yogurt
no
he is
what's the matter with him
running away
because he was so sick you mean
oh he was too sick to climb trees
that's pretty sick for a bear
yeah
that's good
just like
he walked outside
is a plant easier to climb than a tree
huh
do you want something else to eat sweetie pie
oh I'm glad he's better
you want something else to eat sweetie
you wanna get down
do you want some crayons
and markers
do you wanna sort the buttons
what do you wanna do
you wanna go in the car
do you wanna get down
oh it's Mrs Grizz
hello Mrs Grizz
you wanna try one of the cookies that Baba G made
he made them
these have cardamom in them
I can smell it can you smell cardamom
yeah
he put them in there
I think he thought it would be a good flavor in the cookies
hmm
Grizz says what
a muntamum
oh muntamum is instead of cardamom
is that bear language
I see
bear
bear
wondering inside a sponge
or wandering inside a sponge
you know what I think if you are done I'm gonna take away your food because I don't want any extra mess to clean up
and I think you are done aren't you
should we do that
should we take him in the car
oh already that's where we are
huh
well maybe the bird is Dr Bird
no
yeah
yep
because a tree is sometimes
a good place to hide from
animals
that wanna eat them
animals that can't climb trees that is
like
I dunno I think raccoons might eat birds eggs
raccoons can climb trees though
I
see yeah so I dunno
some
not all birds build their nests in trees though some birds build their nests in the grass
or in the sand
at the beach
or some of them even build their nests in houses
like in the little spot up there
I see a yellow jacket nest right there
I think those yellow jackets moved their house over here
right there
now that I'm looking at that I can see there's a little yellow jacket home
you wanna get down now honey
it's hard to see from here it's camouflaged but I'll show you next time we go outside
you wanna get down
camouflaged means it's the same color as the thing that it's on
oh there's chickadee
hello chickadee
have a little of your water
it's good for you it'll help you feel better
juice

a bear
her cave
oh is she hibernating
oh
I'll be very quiet
good morning bear
good morning bear
ooh

good night bear
good morning
it's a bear
oh my gosh
oh okay
well the bear's going to sleep now
good night bear
the mommy bear's going in here for a minute
I guess that bear is asleep
so I'll just put away some clean dishes for a minute
I think I hear a bear in there
oh mother bear to come in
okay
hello
is my bear cub waking up
or is my bear cub asleep
I better be
I'll be very quiet
yes
hello bear cub
a scary bear okay
you are very scary Naima bear
I'm gonna put this away in the kitchen where it goes
okay good night little baby bear
okay I'll say that
let's see I thought I heard a funny noise in here
what's that
I think it's a bear
waking up
coming out of her cave
scaring her mama
good night bear
okay I'll come and say that in just a minute
okay I'll be right there to say that in just a sec
hmm I hear a funny noise in the living room I wonder what that noise is
hmm
I wonder is it a rabbit
maybe it's a rabbit
maybe it's a
chicken
maybe it's a snake I better find out what it is
this must be a bear's cave and that must be a bear in there
it is a little bear
that's a roaring bear
she is
I'm gonna put this away over here
you are very scary
okay good night little bear
what's this it must be
a bear
the
what shall we call it
the little bag that clips on
should we go get that
to clip it on you so you can wear it
you just wanna eat grapes
okay
I'm gonna give you the grapes over here
find what
uhhuh
you already found them
you can have them out of this bowl if you want
it's a colander you are right
it's a strainer
I'm gonna put this here okay
are they good grapes
that's good
cause it's a transmitter
without having it bother you
if you are walking around it would be a good idea to
to wear it and put the transmitter in it
you could carry Olivia and the transmitter in it
is she too little to have a transmitter
mhm
well you know Amanda and Katherine sent us that for the transmitter but I think they wouldn't mind if Olivia also rides in it
Olivia might actually enjoy riding on top of the transmitter
what do you think
she might
she could stand on top of it in the little pouch
that might be fun
but we'll we'll get that in a little bit
we are going to cook some things now
after
you can have your snack
that's fine
you could put rags away for me in a minute too
that's fine you can just eat
it's fine
what am I doing
I'm making saag@sund which means I have to wash a big bowl full of
mustard greens
that kind of a vegetable is called mustard greens
one in
hanging in the bag there
that's what that is
well I need to put it in a lot of water to wash it really nicely
to make sure that the mustard greens get very clean cause we are going to cook them and eat them
cause they don't taste very good if you don't cook them
I think they are kind of bitter
I think they taste bitter
bitter is a flavor
lemme think if you've tasted anything bitter
I think you have tasted something bitter but I'm trying to think of what it was
you know what you had that was a little bit bitter
do you remember once I think you ate some brie@sfra cheese
when we went to Prodigal Son in Hyannis
and Mommy got some brie@sfra cheese and some fruit on a plate to eat
I think that you tried it and I think you actually liked it
but that flavor was a bitter flavor
well I don't really want this shirt to get messy cause this is a shirt that I like
and I'm gonna do some cooking
adjust this a bit
today is November
Thursday November fourteenth
so we are just about a week out from last time we taped
I'm gonna get the bowl
do you remember that
it was quite a while ago
he likes to go there to get coffee sometimes
he likes their coffee the way they make coffee there
he just does I think
I think he thinks it has a good flavor
I think he thinks the coffee that they make at Prodigal Son has a good flavor
well you'd have to ask Daddy
he's the one who knows why
Daddy's friends
okay you asked me what bitter is right
if you taste that and chew it for a while you'll see what bitter means
the flavor of that is bitter
actually it's also spicy so you might not like it
why don't you take it out
those are spicy greens
ooh we are gonna have spicy food tonight
do you like spicy food
do you think likes spicy food
do you think likes it
do you think Daddy likes it
do you think Mommy likes it
the Sleepy likes it too
I think Sleepy likes it
a little what of paprika
a drag
a drag of paprika
I don't know where you got that word from
a drag a drag
cause we are gonna make saag@sund which is a very nice spicy dish and we are gonna have spicy fish too
spicy nag
oh that sounds very interesting
spicy nag
what ingredients does it have
egg and milk and all that kind of stuff
mm
does he know how to make it himself
does he use a stool when he cooks
uhhuh
does he stir things
oh which stool
that one with the blue
the blue leg stool
that one right there
mhm
he uses that one when he cooks
and he doesn't know any better
I see
who is gonna jump into the neighbors
oh a squirrel
oh
oh I see it
I don't know if we are looking at the same one but I see one right by the fence here
are you looking at a different one
oh no it's the same one
the neighbors' yard
yeah I bet he will
oh where'd he go
did he in front of the neighbors
oh there he is again
look at him wiggling his tail
that's funny
you know that's something for us to look up
why do they make their tails move like that
hello

byebye
I just needed to talk to her

if it's not raining then we'll go to Old Townhouse Park
cause that's a really nice play ground and we don't go there very often
but we could go there with him
if it's raining hard then we'll probably do something different but we'll do something with
did you hear me leave that message for his mommy
when we were in the car
yeah if it's raining we might do that
I didn't say yes I said maybe
because I need to talk to her about it first and that's only if it's not
that's only if it's raining
if it's not raining we are gonna go to the play ground
that will be really really fun
do you want some other snack to have
you want a sippy cup of milk
you want some smoothie
okay
if afraid
what does it mean when he says if afraid
it's just a word oh
if Daddy asks you about the school you visited today what are you gonna tell him about it
if he says what was it like at that school what do you think you will say
yeah
uhhuh
will you tell him about the different kinds of toys you saw there and maybe the the ladder and stuff like that
the ladder that you thought was stairs
what toys did you see there
a felt board yep
you took your transmitter off
oh my gosh
you want me to clip it on
it it works kind of like a clothes pin
you squeeze those
except it's really harder than a clothes pin
you could actually really pinch yourself if you aren't careful

oh I was just having fun
it's just
are you cozy when you get into the bed between Mommy and Daddy at night
or in the morning
in between
well being in between
us is cozy so I was just joking that it was cozy for the letter t@l to be in between in the middle of all those other letters
that's like a joke
Tozy very good yes
alright I'll write it down
one second and I'll write it down
you mean like the name of the cat in Mrs McCats
Tozy
I guess that means the word toes
also begins with t@l
mhm

a puppy comes out at the end yes
I think you are right
now it spells oy
are you gonna eat those cookies by the way
now it spells yuh@n
now it doesn't spell anything

no
boys and toys
oys@n
ah
oys@n and doys@n

you need o@l to be next
o@l and then y@l
and then s@l
and now it spells toys
oys@n

t@l s@l o@l spells tso@n
tso@n
that's not really a word but that's what it would sound like if it was a word
so there
well it's just kind of a mean thing to say that's all
well I think you are eating the y@l
I think you are eating the y@l Naima
hello Michaela
is that what Henry the hippo says to Lars the polar bear
who are you and why are you so white
I often wonder that myself
yes
mm it's a good question
it's a good question
oh my gosh I do have an apron on
do I look a little bit like a polar bear
wearing an apron like this
I guess I must
mm
I have an idea about what's scary
I think there is something scary in here
I think it's a little girl who's scary
it's not a little girl
what could it be then
oh my gosh a bear
yikes
yikes
the bear is demanding salmon
oh brother
bah
I will give you some salmon
do you want some
I happen to have some right here for bear emergencies
I also have bear food for bear emergencies
it might be a little bit spicy why don't you try it
you've had it before
it's the same kind you had the other day
I think you liked it
it's salty but I think you liked it
cause you ate it
that's how I could tell
you actually ate it
it actually has salt in it
that kind of salmon
smoked salmon
that's just what it's called
cause been smoked
that means it's been cooked in a certain way
using some salt
and some smoke I think
okay big noise coming
watch out cause I'm gonna use this
close your ears if you need to
it's not
it's the Cuisinart noise
mm okay
I'm done doing that
oops
sag
are you still eating the salmon and the cookies
you are
I see
okay
you can let me know when you are done
I'll give you something else fun to do
oh
do you want to get down and play in the living room or do you want me to give you something fun to do here
okay
just a minute
I have to get it
he did what
he fixed the toast tongs
yeah we'll look for the wood glue later
okay
he did
I see okay
oh
right to the end no
okay
these are walnuts with the shells still on them
I'm gonna give you another muffin tin to put them into
or you could actually put them into the ice cube tray
in fact you could do
are they too big for that container
okay
mm okay I think you are right
so why don't we use this other ice cube tray
we'll take these out
and you can actually
I think we have a muffin tin that has twelve
yeah
I'm gonna give you this big muffin tin
because this has got twelve
and the ice cube tray also has twelve
does it
three four five oops
that has a different number actually
that's alright though
why don't you put them
you can just put them wherever you want okay
this isn't like the sponges where you make them all go in the same
these are different kinds of nuts
you can practice putting them in there
whoops
whoops whoops whoops okay
taking the nuts out
there you can take them out with your fingers
that's another walnut
that's an almond
actually you know I'm not sure
I think it's a Brazil nut
but I'm not positive about that
I think it's a Brazil nut
let me see
I think that's a hazel nut
there are lots of different kinds of nuts
that's a hazel nut
just a second
I'll look in a second
just a second
let's see
show it to me
I think that's a hazel nut
I think that's another hazel nut
just a second honey
the ice cube tray has more than twelve and the muffin tin has twelve places for twelve muffins
and I need some salt
just a second honey
let me see
oh
well I'm not sure
I don't remember
that's something we are gonna have to look up
usually when I buy nuts they already have the shells taken off of them
what you have there are the nuts with the shells still on
they have to be broken to be eaten
let's see
that one I'm not sure
you are right it is
those are the same
they match don't they
you have matching
do you wanna match match the different nuts and the different kinds
why don't you put all the nuts that match in one container and all the nuts that look alike with the dark brown in that container
no I mean you put all the ones that like like this in here put all the ones that look like that
oh you've kind of already sorted them for yourself
I see
if you want to do that
you don't have to do that
I was just suggesting that you sort practice sorting
they are too hard for your teeth to chew them
they are just too hard
it would break your teeth if you tried to
crack them
but a bird or let's see some other kind of animal with strong teeth could probably do it
people don't have teeth as strong as some animals' teeth
they just don't
a bird with a really strong beak might be able to crack that
I don't really know for sure
cause I don't know everything and I don't know everything about every kind of bird
I only know some things about some kinds of birds
oh dear I think I've forgotten what a chickadee eats
definitely eats some seeds
I think chickadees do eat insects
if I'm not mistaken
do you wanna take the nuts and play with them down on the floor
okay
do you wanna help me make some cookies
do you need to use the potty love
okay
alright
do you wanna help make cookies
okay
let's see to do that you will need definitely to wash hands
why don't you put all the nuts
let's put all the nuts in one container and save them
I think we'll save them in a good
how many are there
let's see
let's put all the nuts in a yogurt container
why don't you put them all in there and then
whoops
and then I will help you put the top on it
Daddy especially
yeah I think you are right
Mommy does too
cause it makes the food taste good
whoa
that sounds great
you made a musical instrument
you want another yogurt container
you could make two of those musical instruments
you put some more nuts in here then you could make another musical instrument
it's like a shaky a shaky yogurt container
not a shaky egg but a shaky yogurt container
whoops
here you go
you wanna put the other nuts in the other one
whoa
the top wasn't on
alright shall I help you put the top on more securely
are you making one or two of these
okay
okay
let's put all of them in then
here's some more nuts
let me see this
let me see
there try that
you know what it sounds a little different every time you put more or less nuts in it
that'll sound different
that one will sound empty I bet
but you know what might sound different if you put something really small in there like some of your beans
let's put beans in one of them and see what it sounds like
and close it close it up real tight
there
that does sound different
the nuts
nuts
who says nuts
does a squirrel say that
nuts
what did I put in here
cornmeal
whoop
oh this mixing bowl is very heavy
mixer I mean
mm
where's the butter that I just had in my hand
one two three
where's my butter
cause I just had four sticks of butter and now suddenly I only have three
I've lost my butter
what shall I do
lost my butter
what shall I do
oh Naima
oh my god I'm glad I got that on tape
you found the butter
well it's not for playing with
I didn't know you had it
it's for cooking with
it's not for playing with
does it feel interesting on your hands
you wanna build something with butter
well let's see
when we make the cookie dough I'll let you build something with cookie dough
how's that
alright
when we make the cookie dough
oh my goodness yes you did have the butter
I didn't know you had the butter
butter is food it's not actually a toy but I will
I will let you play with some cookie dough after we make the dough okay
but we need to make the dough first
you want me to help you put the top on that
oh
okay you are gonna need to pick
get on the floor and pick those up okay
no
you can put these in here first but then you need to go pick the other nuts up
I'll help you get down
and you need to put them away or play with them in the living room
I don't want them on the floor there
I'm gonna count to ten then you are gonna pick up the ones that are on the floor
do you need help getting down
I don't mind if you shake it but I want you to pick up the nuts that are spilled on the floor too
you can shake it
you can have it to shake after you pick up the other nuts
you are having Ring Around the Rosy at the dance party
here put your other nuts in there
and then I'll give you the top after you collect all your nuts
you are collecting nuts just like a squirrel does
and then I will let you help me make the cookies if you would like to
yeah this is some food that I'm picking up off the floor not the nuts
you are doing a good job picking those up Naima
there's one there
and there's some up on the table too
wanna get those
you want me to help put that on then you could shake it
okay
I guess we are gonna turn off the tape
speaking of keys where are they
Naima can you tell me what the date is today
dyou remember what we said
seventh of what month
what month is it
you remember
it's right on
yes
mhm
good job
it is January
it's definitely January
do you want to wear your slippers
are your feet cold
mm
uhhuh
oh
so you have a raincoat
oh he doesn't need a raincoat
you are gonna throw what in the stroller
hmm
the bookstore was closed that day too
did you see someone opening it with keys
do you mean Barnes and Noble
you were there so early that they hadn't even opened yet
is this warm
oh it is
he's shy about having his picture taken
yes
it's not food
are you pretending it's food
mhm
this is the microphone part is this part right here
and that back there is the transmitter in your pocket
yes
that's a very grownup thing to have in your pocket
I've got one in my pocket too
hmm hmm
mhm
you are his mommy
is his mommy hungry
does she need to eat
you could eat some grown up food
if you were hungry
does Sleepy Bear's mommy eat grown up food usually
oh she likes that
I heard you
okay
did he have his supper
oh
so he didn't have anything stinging because he didn't have any boo boos even though he ate with his hands
oh
that's good
but there's another reason not to eat with your hands
even if you don't have boo boos you might decide to eat with a fork and a spoon
you know why
because then your hands stay clean
and that's kinda nice
it means that when you are finished eating all you have to do is wipe them a little bit on a napkin
they are both shy about having their picture taken
why is that
why are they shy
is that how you have your picture taken
oh
should I bring the camera and be the person taking their picture
and they can pretend to be shy
mm okay
mhm
mm
oh what a great idea
I will bring the camera in there
and take a picture like that
oh
I'm looking for the camera
no I have
well that's a different camera Honey
you want to stand there again
I'll take a picture of you with him there
you hafta stay still and you hafta smile and you hafta ask him to smile
you gonna hold the handle of the stroller to show that you are strolling him in the picture
and can you smile
how about you
Mommy has to smile too
you are being still
okay I don't have any more
let's see
it's a good picture
you wanna see it
there it is
that's you
Sleepy Bear and his mommy
that's a nice picture
yes
oh by itself
well I have to erase some more pictures to make enough room
for me to take more pictures so you have to wait just a minute while I do that
are you gonna tell me if you need a potty Honey
would you wanna put some socks on to keep your feet warm
because it looks like maybe your feet are cold
okay
you sure
am I an obstacle course
you just leapt over my leg
you leapt over my leg
that means you leaped
leapt means leaped
it looks like you are getting toasty warm on that heating vent
I'm worried that you might be a little cold
are you a little cold
the wheels
oh the yellow part
I don't know what that's for exactly
mhm
she doesn't like having her picture taken
oh it's a nice blue pond isn't it
she's swimming
where is our chicken
where is our chicken
the mall's chicken
oh oh
oh okay
the pet store
oh the camera store
oh we already went there
hmm
there's a drugstore in the mall that we go to sometimes
oh
I'm gonna check and make sure this is recording
it is recording yes
oh are you thinking about Sears where we got our picture taken once
I wondered if that's what you were thinking about
you were only there once really
well we went to check and see if they were open yet but there were a lot of people in line
that's true
you thinking trying to think of other stores in the mall you could open up or go to
you know there's a toy store in the mall
you wanna take Sleepy Bear to that toy store
I don't think you know the name of it
it's called The Learning Connection or something like that
but it's a toy store in the mall
it's the toy store where we got the felt board
I don't know if you
you probably don't remember that
it's in the mall
and there's clothing stores in the mall
there are definitely clothing stores
that's good
he doesn't need them does he because he's got fur
how about we could pretend there's a salmon store in the mall
a bear grocery store with just things that bears like
mm
hmm
how about nuts
what other kinds of nuts
what was that other kind in in addition to hazel nuts that you just mentioned
mhm
how about peanuts
peanuts are nuts too
yeah
no I know you don't
well it's one of those things
some people like some foods and other people don't
it doesn't have to do with whether you are grown up or not really
just has to do with people people liking different things
like I like chocolate and you don't
and
let's see Daddy like
oh that's a good question
what does Daddy like that I don't like
Daddy likes something called
well let's see
that's not a good example
hmm there is some things there are some things Daddy likes that I don't like
Daddy likes whole wheat halwa@sund and I don't like that very much
Daddy likes
I like most things Daddy likes actually I think
but lemme think
Daddy likes
Daddy likes to eat a lot of nuts
I like to eat nuts but I don't like them as much as Daddy does
Daddy really likes to eat nuts
hmm that's a good question
Daddy likes soy milk
and I don't like it very much
Daddy likes
what do you like Naima
that's true I don't drink nursies
I don't need nursie milk because I'm a grown up
grown ups don't drink nursie milk
oh
even pretend
oh
Koala did
yeah
she dumped the coffee grounds in the hall just like you did this morning
she did that
what did her mommy do
that's good
did she help
I see
oh is Koala's daddy
oh
is Koala Mala afraid of the noise of the vacuum cleaner just like you are Naima
oh
oh why is she afraid of that
squares
the square shape of the vacuum cleaner
oh
so if the vacuum cleaner had a round shape do you think she would still be afraid of it
oh
mm
even if it was rectangular she'd be scared
what other shapes could it have
mm
mhm
globe shaped hmm
mm
trapezoid
diamond
do you need to use the potty
do you need to use the potty
child
okay that's a nice no no no song
didjou make that up
no no no no no no
yes
in the mall
did you already go to the bear grocery store
oh
oh
Digissi that's a store I don't know about
the y@l
that's an interesting name for a store
oh
at Shop and Shop
oh boy
what a lucky bear
someone gives him shrimp
he doesn't even pay for it
or he pays for it at the store
yes
ah
is that you
yeah yeah
your black wallet is right here
oh
oh let's see
I think it's down under here
that blue one that Dadaji gave ya
is that the one you are thinking of
well I think it might be in here though
here you go
here's your purse
you gonna put your wallet in your purse
are you leaving the house to go to the store
getting all the things you need to go
when I leave the house what's another thing I look for and I sometimes can't find do you know
my keys
sometimes I look for my keys when I need to leave the house and I can't find them
hmm
because you can walk a long ways
great
does he like to go for long walks in the stroller
oh
kind of a long walk
but if it's a sunny day that's okay
okay
okay
like that
okay
like that
he doesn't have a new what
oh pet
oh
what kinda pet would he like if he could have a pet
oh the Green Briar Nature Center
oh
oh the ones that he already has over there
what do we have over there
what kind of pets are over there
what kind of birds
is someone in there
who is it
I'll go check and see who it is
something's in here
it's a duckling
Sleepy Bear is this your duckling
oh
why is the duckling scared
oh that's nice
what are you gonna do to comfort the duckling
can't
oh
poor duckling
can't even quack
is it a little duckling
what's that duckling's name
oh yes Motorcycle Chicken
I've heard of Motorcycle Chicken
what are you gonna do
is there a veterinarian in this town
does this town have a veterinarian's office
or an animal hospital
oh
oh what do you think a duckling might have swallowed
other than grain
something really small other than grain
do you need to use the potty
I'll go with you
and we can take Sleepy Bear and show him how to use the potty
what could a duckling swallow
a duckling could swallow a key
that is
that someone left on the ground
or a duckling could swallow a coin
oh
is it stuck in the duckling's throat
oh
what do you think we should do
it turned out I was his mommy
okay
okay
by the way let's see
the new Sleepy Bear could be in the bathroom or in the
living room
should we check
oh he's right there
right in the hallway
yes I'm the person behind the counter
oh
what kind of store is this Naima
oh this is the toy store
yes we are open now and we do have some toys that little bears might like
let me
let me take out a few things I could show you and you can decide if you think your little bear would like them
we have some cups which are very nice for stacking and putting together
like that
that's good for a little toddler or a big toddler even
and another nice toy for a child is a watering can
in fact my little girl has several watering cans at home
my little girl has a green one just like this and she also has one in the shape of an elephant
so I I would recommend that as a very nice present to give your child
let's see there's something called a Magna Doodle
and you can draw on it and you can write words on it
like
what's your child's name
oh I think I will do that
Sleepy Bear s@l l@l e@l
e@l
p@l y@l Sleepy Bear
and then bear is his other part of his name
b@l
e@l
a@l
r@l
there I spelled his name
wouldja like to show this to him
bear
this part says Sleepy Bear
and this part says Sleepy Bear
yes
that's a very good question
well
doodling means to write or draw a lot of different things
some of them can be words but usually just little drawings
doodle means to draw really
okay
ah I'll beep it for you yes
beep
that's going to be five dollars
the cups are a dollar each
so that makes five
six
seven dollars is what you owe me
are you buying the watering can too
wouldjou like a little help with that
is this the toy store that
what were you asking me
oh it looks like you are buying two cups that are a dollar each
and you are also buying the Magna Doodle which is five dollars
so that's seven dollars that you owe me
five
six
seven
do you have seven dollars
okay
mm okay
oh I think those are mostly one hundred aren't they
oh do you think you have seven in there
how many do you have
oh
okay
yeah you are right
but how many of those bills do you have
on the floor
how many are on the floor
mm
well why don't you give me a couple of those and we'll pretend it's seven dollars
unless you'd like me to make you seven dollars
oh are we gonna make some money
you know we could actually get bunny money and take it downstairs to the photocopier and make money that way
with Mahatma Gandhi and
that's actually pictures of money
it's pretend money but we could do that
should we go down and do that
Chief Seattle
we could make money
mm
Jesse Norman
Martina Navratilova
Mother Hale
yep
hmm
who else
Jonas Salk
Mahatma Gandhi
well let's get the book and see
Fred Astaire bunny yes
Fred Astaire
oh Jane Austen
Desmond Tutu
you wanna go down and make money with the photocopier
are you a child who might like something to
oh you mean draw it with drawing
cutting construction paper
I could make you money that way
I could make it the same size as a real dollar bill
yeah
you like that idea yeah
yeah
yeah
Naima wouldja like a little supper
something to eat or snack
you heard a Daddy noise
your ears are better than mine
I hear the camera
wanna go check and see if Daddy's car is out on the side
we could do that
no
wouldja like a snack
would you like some frozen strawberry
what snacks like wouldja like
like
almond butter
bear food
glass of milk
milk and cookies
it's not breakfast time silly girl it's supper time
it's past supper time
it's dessert time

listen
do you want potatoes with ketchup
it's not breakfast time
do you want scrambled eggs
how about
oh
I'm
I'm sorry duckling
I apologize
you could have porridge
how about some fresh apple
and yogurt
I thought we decided the duckling had swallowed a coin
oh
oh alright
are you getting sick
come here
can I feel your forehead please oh
mm
I just wanna feel your forehead
I wanna go
just like that
can you feel your own forehead
don't hurt your toes honey
don't hurt those toes
you need them to tip on
do you need them
do you use them to tip on
you don't use them for tipping
just for toeing
do you use them for toeing
you don't use them for tipping
oh
walking is going somewhere on your feet
okay would you like me to do that
I will do that
okay
oh there's Bunny Money
oh this is where you make the money
see there's five dollar bills and one dollar bills here
but you said you wanted me to make the money out of construction paper instead of photocopying
making it by photocopying
let's go to the basement then
we hafta do it down there
okay
alright we'll go down and do that
alright
when we come back up we should probably clean up your room a little bit so nobody trips
oh okay once we make the money
alright
Sleepy Bear
it's dark
I know
dark
ow
jeez
ah that just gave me a shock
that's not good
alright
let's come here hold my hand
yeah I know
I'm gonna turn the lights on down here
sheesh it's very very dark I know
nobody's here but us monkeys
oh jeez
alright you know what
we are going upstairs
you know why
you know why
because the all the light fixtures down here are giving me a big shock and I don't like that
didjou feel something in your hand
didjer hand just feel funny
because you were holding onto my hand when I did that
did this hand feel funny
good
glad to hear that
I'm not
you know what
we can
I'm gonna make it out of construction paper okay
I'm gonna draw sevens on it
I'm gonna make it
well you know what
there's no such thing as a seven dollar bill
to make seven dollars you have to take a five dollar bill and two one dollar bills
and that makes seven
ah jeez
that was really weird
okay

could
you want the children to count the numbers that are on the white board over there

because
today is the eighth of January
good job Sleepy Bear
who else can count up to eight

let's hide an eight
okay I guess we need to write the number eight on something then
where is the seven that we had
oh the seven's up there
let's turn it over and write eight on the back
oh we could hide that eight
we could hide the number eight that's blue next to that seven
it doesn't have to be on a piece of paper
okay can you get the seven down
the seven on the brown paper on the white board
no
above it
up on top
that seven
yeah
I will write eight on the back
and then we'll hide the eight just like at Cotuit Nursery School
if I told you I wouldn't be hiding it
we do need a pen though don't we
because you are a teacher you mean
well we let's write the eight on it and then we'll figure out about hiding it
let me see
is there any pen up here
I'm gonna go get a pen
here's a pen
oh
I'm sorry that that happened
this is not supposed to be dragged around
cmon over here
no cords actually aren't allowed
okay where's that
here's that piece of paper
shall I draw an eight
dyou wanna write the eight
dwan try writing it yourself
okay
draw a funny eight
this is a pen
you've never used a pen before
oh this pen isn't working
there we go
here is an eight
that's not the eight down there
eight
okay
let's see
where should I hide it
mm hmm
children you are not allowed to look
I'm gonna hide it somewhere where you can see it but you'll have to still look for it to see it
which child is gonna find the eight
it has to be
there
actually I want it to be right side up
hmm maybe that's not a good place
yeah that's a good place
he did
mm okay
let's teach the children about cows when you are done
well because school is a place to learn things
let's read the story about different kinds of cows
let's show them the picture of the three cows on your door
on the door to your room
let's take it down and show it to them and explain what the different kinds of cows are
you can leave the tape on if you want

is it time to give the children their snack Miss
okay Motorcycle Chicken
can you see Motorcycle Chicken
yes
is it time to give children their snack do you think Miss
decide
I can decide you mean
I think we should give the children their snack
well I think we should give out some pretend cookies
so let's get some pretend cookies
what do you think
is that a good idea
yeah
that's a really good idea
usually when you eat you want something to drink too
do you think these children are old enough to have cups that they can drink with both hands without a top on it like a sippy cup
oh
she's pretty old to be in nursery school
oh
oh they know how to count
should we use get some
oh you put it back
good
that's right where it belongs
after the seven and before the nine
that's where an eight belongs
the nine belongs after the eight and before the ten
January tenth
well January tenth is a special day
it's somebody's birthday
you
I'm what
can I be Mommy your mommy again for a little bit
oh
I wanted to be your mommy again
they haven't come back yet
so they still need the teachers here
do you need to use the potty
your pants are falling off of your bottom
did you notice that
why don you take those off because they are gonna come off anyway
see because they are backwards
might as well take them off
and that way when you are ready to go to the potty you'll already have your pants off
and then we are gonna go soon to go look for the new Sleepy Bear who's lost
we need to go to Cotuit to look for him
well we don't want him to stay there
I don't
I wanna find him
so we are gonna spend another five or ten minutes and then we are gonna go to find him in the car
oh
let's give him honey cookies
why don't we pretend those rocks are the cookies
we can give one to each child in the school
because cats like milk
yes they could have milk in them
they could be milk flavor cookies
oh they are not milk flavor
I see
I see
okay let's give everyone a snack then
well we don't have enough chairs
everyone's gonna hafta sit on the floor for snack
everyone's ready
everyone's hungry right now
let's make sure we bring them some snack
every child can have one cookie

outdoor chair to sit in

the daddy's legs are cold
yeah
hey did you put that dress on the daddy
all by yourself wow

I usually do it one at a time
get one all the way on
and then try and get the other foot in
oh there now the daddy's legs aren't cold anymore
and should we put
oh okay
even though it's overalls
you wanna pretend something else is a jacket
how about
how about this
oh
oh okay
that's overalls also
yes it's the same pair
yeah
because when Grandma got you these last year for Christmas she got you two different sets of dolls
and some of the dolls were the same and had the same clothes even
I was wondering if you were a little bit cold there
it is
tickly
so is the daddy gonna stroll that baby
oh yeah
a velcro jacket
you gonna put it on him
now that you can put things on by yourself
now let's see
I was doing
a little cleaning up in here
oh
you having trouble putting the jacket on
do you want me to come and help
if you ask me I will come
would you like some help
you wanna scream oh
oh that jacket just won't go on huh
can we do it together
yeah okay
let's see
this arm
that's inside that arm's inside out maybe that's why it was a problem
now that both arm's are in the right place
you wanna put this other arm through
you gotta pull and stretch it
yeah
there
oh what a nice red jacket
that Daddy's not gonna be cold at all
oh dear
what's happening
the velcro doesn't attach
just a sec
do you want my help
okay
I was just putting down my drink so it wouldn't spill over here
okay what is the problem with the red jacket
okay okay
do you want me to put the daddy's hands on the stroller
okay
let's see how will this go
there how's that
is that how you want it to be
hmm
it must be somewhere in there
I bet
I would look for it in here
you might see it if you take a few things out
hmm
I'm not sure where it is you know it could be somewhere else
it's a very small thing
here's a piece of clothing
that's not a back pack though is it
hmm oh wait what's this tadah
is it empty is there something in it
oh dear
you need you need help putting the back pack on
okay
I think the green part's come check okay because I can't see too well from all the way over here
oh come show me yeah
the green part yes that's the back that's the part that will go against the back of the daddy doll
mhm
oh you know where it is it's on
it's on the it's either on the table where your stable is I think
oh goodness
hi

can you can you show me how you put that on and I'll take a picture
because now you can do it
this is the first day you've ever done that isn't it
yeah
there's some clothes here
how about that
oh
well that's
we'll fluff them up
yeah
yup
you got her arms right out in front of her that's a good idea
mhm
they do
here put her hands right up like that and put one of the sleeves right over
you know what
you wanna put it this way
right
yeah
that's fine
do one arm at a time
you need to put it on inside
look look this is where her arm goes
there
you know what
can I show you
this is where her arms are gonna go inside these holes
they are not gonna go in this way that would be putting it on backwards
her arms have to go in these holes
one at a time is a good way to do it
yup
I see her other arm
there
now she's got a night gown on
is she gonna velcro up the back
it's that green one right there isn't it
and I think you put the is the mattress and the blanket over here
I think this is the mattress
and that's the blanket
the red's the blanket and that's the mattress the futon
I'm going to make a phone call
seven seven one o@l o@l nine three
o@l o@l nine three
hi I have a Eureka Mighty Might that needs a little repairing
it's actually just the part that attaches I don't know even what you call it
attaches into the main body of the vacuum
yeah the place where the hose attaches there's a tiny tiny piece of plastic that's broken off
but it may need the whole hose may therefore need replacing
do you carry all those parts or
yeah
right
that's right except that it's been a really good machine so
yeah
yeah
how long does it take to order parts usually for those
mm
that's awhile okay well if I can I will try and bring it in later
what are your hours normally
thank you very much okay byebye
mm
phooey said Mommy
you okay
oh to pretend that they are
yeah
is that gonna be Pikes with Parents
do you need some help
oh
do you want some help sweetie
no
oh dear
there seems to be a lot of unhappiness in this house
is there something you'd like to do
that would be more fun
oh
that's the swimsuit it's it is very hard
can I hold her while you put it on
would that help
you know yeah
that's not how it goes you are right
let's look at this if you were putting on your swim suit would you put your feet in first
is that how we put your swimsuit on you
okay if you hold it
I'll put her feet in
there's one foot
hey is she gonna wear these black shoes into the pool
they don't come off I know
yeah
so now she's got it on her bottom
now she just needs to get out her arms
I will hold it and what you wanna do is stretch it way out until it gets unto her shoulder like that
now her other one stretch that sleeve way out there yup
it's very stretchy fabric
oh it's like the yarn sweater
now you can velcro it up
hey
okay on this there's only been about five or ten minutes
interval between the last tape and this one
on the twenty second of January
hmm
that's my name
yes
what about the doll's stuffed animals
the daddy's gonna go to work now
oh he's gonna work down in the basement
that kind of office
the home office the office at home
okay
is it we could make that could be the basement down there
oh
hmm
okay we could try to do that
uhhuh
and that's where the office will be
oh
okay
well we could put the base plate there
and then we could build the desk and put the computer and what else is down there
in the basement
yes
yeah he has a lots of messed up papers down there that's true
okay
well we could use regular chairs for his desk chair
and we could make this this could be his desk
we could put two of these together to make his desk
like that
that's about the size of his desk and we could put a chair there
here's here's a here's a green chair
you know we could build it and then we could slide it underneath after we build it
what do you think
what else is in his office
the base plate
but while we are building it we can keep it right here if we want to
kay
what else does he have down here
the treadmill
okay
this block almost look like a treadmill if it was this way
not really
that's true it doesn't have a hold in it
hmm
the treadmill also has like two handles
doesn't it
kind of like you know to go up to the side that he holds onto I thought I would make that part
wait wait wait wait wait wait
because I thought you know like he when he walks on the treadmill
he holds on
right
yeah
and then there's a bar across them
let's get one more yellow small yellow lego
to go here
and then something goes across that he
I don't really
huh
something is wrong with this lego
so it can kinda look like the treadmill
well that's I think it looks kinda like the treadmill
then he has he has a sofa right here doesn't he
next to his desk
a pink one
do you need to use the potty
okay
let's go look
the one that's a pull out sofa that great grandma slept on when she was with us
it pulls out
and turns into a bed
yeah you know which one I mean
should we make that
you are right
could we use red instead maybe
you are right there are no pink legos
there does that kinda look like that's a sofa
that's part of the sofa
I'm pretending that's the part that you sit on and this is the back of the sofa
I'm just pretending
this is the part to lean against that's what I was thinking
and you sit like this
if the doll was there she'd be she'd sit like this
on the sofa
this is a nonfunctioning Lego
yup push
yeah push
yeah yup
watch Mommy do it
pushing
you can use your regular voice if you want help with something sweetie
Bibby would sit like that
is that Bibby
Bibby
Bibby and Bobby
mhm
would you are you interested in sitting on your bed and reading a book and having some quiet time
it might be nice
because it's kind of nap time for you
oh build a guest bedroom okay
here's a bed
how about right over here
guests sleep over here
in the guest bedroom
there's the bed
yup
there's a little table in our guest bedroom isn't there
like this table was on this side
this side
the table that holds magazines and things
and I think maybe there's even
is there a little table on this side too
yeah
alright
okay
did you see that I put the water colors and papers out for whenever you are ready
to paint with the water colors
yeah there might be just one I don't remember
if there's two or one
it's still snowing out look
you can see some snow falling still
because the lights aren't on
and it's a dark day it's not a sunny day
alright here we are
oh there are two tables see
one on that side
and one on that side
and there are two lamps too
you could do that
and there's the chair in the guest bedroom also
okay
yeah
alright
is your neck itchy
why don't you walk up the stairs
oopsie
because it's got a zipper
here hold still for a second
okay leave that there
please
you wanna unzip it all the way
okay I'll move the microphone then
okay just a second
alright
alright
you don't have to inhale it
let's go upstairs
inhale means to breathe
you looked like you were breathing in the microphone
I don't know
oh that's what you were doing
yes oh you are in luck
Naima I'm gonna check and see if there's any laundry I need doing I'll be right back
just to the washing machine
hi
hey where's your microphone
oh brother
oh Naima
alright where is it honey
on the floor okay
okay
you wanna do the painting now
because I thought that it might be easier if I give you one color and then another and then another
because that way the colors you won't get all all mixed up on the brush
which is what sometimes happens
well there's actually some water right there
and there's also some on top so there's some in there
yeah ooh
yeah of course not you can take as long as you want
thank you sweetie
you can let me know if you decide you want another color
okay
which color would you like next
purple green blue orange red
brown
you want brown okay
I'll get you brown
and then after you are done with brown you can pick out another color
there's red
he says wed with a w@l
yeah
Wodney Wat
some toddlers can't
well because even when you are a little kid you are still learning how to talk aren't ya
it's not so easy
to learn how to talk
it's a very difficult thing
yup that's another way you can do it alright
oh what color would you like next
wed or red
red
okay
let me have that brush
and I will get you the red now
do you like that Wodney Wat story
yeah
why does the title of the book say Wodney Wat instead of Rodney Rat
the title of the book uses
the way Wodney says his name
because it's about him it doesn't use
what probably his parents probably say Rodney rat right
well they aren't toddlers they probably can pronounce their r@l
properly
well grown ups usually can pronounce things
it's just that when you are little and growing up some things are hard to pronounce
it's hard to twist your mouth in that just the right way
don't you think
do you think it's hard to say some words
what words do you think it's hard to say
there's water right in there
yup the paint gets into the water and colors the water red
he does
he can't
what's in my nose or anyone's nose
hmm
there's little hairs in most people's noses
the hairs keep all the dirt out
and other things from getting up into your nose and your throat
well if you didn't have all the little hairs in your nose then you might get big pieces of dust or little pieces of dirt up in your throat
because your nose is actually connected to your throat
okay
oh
with a tail
oh
oh my
a blue ear above
blue air above oh like sky you mean
here's some black
yeah I gave you a different brush because the other one it looked like the pieces of the brush were coming out on your paper because you were banging the brush on the paper see how there's little pieces of brush on your paper
on your painting
what things are black
well sometimes the sky can look black if there's a storm coming
it's usually a very very dark grey not actually black
but at night sometimes the sky can look black
when it's nighttime
okay
the animal eats the black thing
oh
that's alright
I'll clean it up
when you are done with the painting
oh
oh the black stuff is stuff inside the animal's nose
oh
which pink part
oh
that's where its nose is
huh
uhhuh
okay
oh
hmm
oh so the sky has dark parts and blue parts
wow look at all the snow in the sky right now
my goodness
it's really snowin
you want some blue now
okay
should I take that
mhm
that's part of the sky
yeah
it's getting to be dark yeah
I think the you haven't had the green or the orange or the purple but you've had the other colors
yeah okay hold on
what do you think sometimes is
yeah
funny shaped grapes
that are not good to eat
oh that are good to eat
sometimes the sky can be purple what other things are purple
the sky can be purplish if there's a nice sunset
and some flowers are purple
let's see
let me get you the purple
are you all done with the blue
do you want me to get the purple or are you still painting with the blue
okay
do you want me to get the purple for you
when you are done with that
yup you can call them pictures or paintings
yup
well they are pictures
you could say your painting a picture or you could say your painting a painting
because painting means what you are doing but it also means what it is you painted
yeah I think that's probably what we say in this house we say you are painting a painting
or your painting a picture
I guess maybe we say both
here is the purple
sky can be purple sometimes if there is sunset
and it's more that it's purplish it's not usually bright purple
mhm
oh boy
are you done with the purple
you wanna keep the purple there and I'll give you some orange
I'll give you a separate I'll give you a different
brush for the orange so that the orange and the purple don't get all mixed together
so I'll put the orange all the way over here let me get some water for that
let's see
okay
now I'll actually move this down here since you are mostly done with the purple
now you can use the brush for the orange
oh sun
yes sometimes it is
well
usually it's part of a sunrise colors or sunset colors you can see orange
I think green is the only one you haven't had
okay
don't paint on the table please
you can use this brush for the green
can you think of anything
no
when you go outside what things do you see that are green outside
ah yes
grass
yes
would you like another piece of paper
you mean you are done painting that one
okay
wow
oh alright
do you need a little water next to the green
looks like it
here
oops a little too much
that's for me
yay
I'm gonna come look at it
do you want me to write anything on it or do you wanna just leave it without any writing on it
would you like another piece of paper
hmm
mm
yeah it needs sometime to dry
lemme get you some paper
I'm gonna get you a smaller piece this time
okay
so now you have three colors
you have orange green and purple all together there
well so that you don't mix the colors up
if you use one brush for the orange and then you use the same brush for the green
the colors will mix up and probably become some version of brown
sometimes you wanna do that but you may not wanna do that all the time
so this way you can use more than one brush
one for each color if you want to
uhhuh
ah
and what color are you finding that you make when you do that
what would you call the combination color
I was peeling carrots and slicing them
woo peeling them
no I was actually peeling them
hmm
making some lines
hmm
hmm
well when he comes home you can tell him about combining the colors
it's seems like I do get a picture almost every day you've given me one
it's very nice to have them
really
he's at work
you know those brushes really are shedding their their brush their
these aren't very good brushes
because they are just coming out
the bristles these are called the bristles
the bristles just are coming right out
are you done with this one do you want me to put it aside
do you want any writing on it
mm okay
you wanna write with a different with a pen or a crayon or something
you can write letters with paint
do you wanna try that
you can
is that what you wanna do
yeah
you are gonna do it
it says for Daddy from Naima
you mean right here
mm
hmm
yup
you want another piece of paper to make another one
okay
Naima what did I just ask you
Naima what
I'll pour some extra water how's that
you are right a tooth brush is another thing that has brushes on it
brushes like this
do you wanna ask me for some certain colors
you want a set of colors for your painting
not the same ones
okay
which ones then
I'm gonna give you the the really thick brush
you don't want the white one
Naima what colors of paint would you like for mixing colors
that's from what you painted yesterday that's dried up
I wanna get you some
remember we bought brown and yellow yesterday
do you want brown or yellow to mix with another color
shall I display some paint
the older paint
okay
the batteries just ran out I think
ooh look at those colors look at that blue that you made
we are combining wow
I really like that color
you seem to give me a lot
that's for me

would you like more of the same colors
white and blue and
a yellow banana
is this for Daddy
are you gonna what
yeah it's okay
hmm
oh
we'll take it all off and we'll wash it
I think you do
you haven't had one for awhile and now you do have a lot of paint on you
I think we'll wash all of you Naima
Daddy
mothers call their children babies even if they are not really babies anymore
it's kind of you know it's kind of just an expression you know that means
an expression is something that's not exactly true
but in this case it means
it's kind of like saying I love you I remember when you were a baby
you are my baby because you are my baby from the day you were born
or you are my baby ever since you were teenie and tiny
and I took care of you and did everything for you I remember doing that
when a mommy or a daddy calls a toddler or a bigger kid a baby even my mother sometimes says you know you are still my baby
oh it's just a way of saying
so when Mommy or Daddy calls you baby it's just another way of saying hey I love you
what do you think of that
I know Daddy is going to really like that picture a lot
yeah
you are done with all your painting
okay
well I'm putting them on your table first but I really need to remind you to not touch them until they are dry when they are on your little black table in the living room
I need to make sure
that is a really splendid painting
splendid means quite nice quite nice
it will dry but it will take awhile it might be dry tomorrow morning
it might even be dry tonight but I'm not sure

here's some finger paint
oh well you know what since you are gonna be using finger paint anyway
okay
this is finger paint paper it's a little bit slippery
kind of like a slippery paper
oh snakes I think
yes
the people who made the paint are the ones who decided to paint the pictures on them
why do you
why do you think they might do that
why do you think there's any pictures at all
on the paint containers
maybe to show people who are in the store what's inside
the container
I was big
oh thanks
oh
does finger paint dry
if it does it's don't know if it does
what's so funny
it's kind of slimy

oh I'll have to take off my sock won't I
just a moment
let's see here alright
here I'll take my I'll take my
with my ear fine
because of the medicine you gave me
okay can you examine my toe
I stubbed the little baby toe on the book rack
are you putting toe cream on my toe
oh good thank you what are you going to do to make it better
ah thank you
should I give my toe toe cream every day
can you get that over my heel there
oh thank you
I'll do the rest of it
okay thank you very much doctor Lisa
I will go home now
I have an idea
we could make an animal hospital and Pushpa could be the the veterinarian instead of the farmer
and she could take care of the farm animals that the farmer brings into the veterinary hospital
yes
Veena has to walk with the animals is there a vehicle that
whoop
oh okay
it's not a farmer
okay
oh hmm let's see hmm let's examine this young calf here
is it this boo this ear or this ear
both boo boos on both ears let me see
hmm hmm hmm everything's going to be alright little calf
hmm okay I'm going to give you a prescription and I want you to put this ear cream on the calf
go get that at the pharmacy is there something wrong with your adult cow as well
oh you have a microphone injury
oh this big cow has a microphone injury hmm
where is it exactly
on the tip of the cow's ear alright
let me just examine this with my special cow otoscope
hmm yes there's a different prescription that cow needs a different kind of medicine
from the pharmacy here you go
okay
yeah
thank you for coming
I think you should call me tomorrow and let me know if the ears have gotten better after you put the ear cream on
okay
Veena put them on both
that's good
you know usually it's the farmer who brings the cows to the veterinary hospital
yeah because cows don't actually
well cows cows usually really need a human to to drive them places
I guess that's the main reason
oh they were walking yeah
oh it's close by that's why you told me
that's good
I think they are all in the chicken coop that you made
oh dear is there a chick emergency
oh what's the problem with this young
that's good yeah
well hello little chick what seems to be the trouble
oh you have a foot on the oh injury on the bottom of your foot there
let me examine this
this chick's foot here oh yes okay
let me bandage up that up a little
and I suggest that you wrap this chick in a warm blanket
for at least a couple of hours
well you'll have to find something smaller like a cloth napkin
and wrap the chicken in the cloth piece of cloth
just for a few hours to help while its while its foot is bandaged and it needs to rest
it needs to stay warm while it's injured
and then at one o'clock you can take the bandaid the blanket off
well you don't need to tape it on all I'm saying is you need to keep the chick chick warm and dry
and stop it from running around for the next few hours
well I I would suggest you try to keep it keep it nice and quiet and maybe read it a book or something
the chick doesn't like long stories I see well maybe you could read it some poetry
thank you for coming why don't you call me tomorrow and let me know if the chick's foot has gotten better or not
oh
Pushpa's over here checking the camera
oh good
I'm glad to hear that
those these cows need to go back home
bring those cows home to get better
oh dear a fox
was this fox hit by a car accidentally
hmm hmm
think that I will put some nose cream on this fox and just let it go it's a wild animal
I'm gonna let it go it should get better by itself
the nose cream
mm
let see
well it's a wild animal and I expected that that might happen
wild animals don't take directions very well
alright well that's all you are going to get
even the little bit that was on you for short while should've helped you
oh someone ate the chicken and spit it out
okay this chick needs to be in a little tiny tiny blanket is there anything we can get how about one of those blue socks on the floor over there
let's wrap the chick up in that sock
here's the chick
okay that should keep the chick nice and safe and warm for a while
yes
yes
who's saying help
mm
oh dear
Pushpa is the veterinarian
oh dear

because tomorrow you got to go to the dentist

yeah but don't they use your license for i d usually
I mean it would just be easier if you had your license and you need it
since you've been driving a year without it now
why
why can't you get it
oh you probably just have to pay
oh they are not going to make you take the test
no
they don't do that
it's very rare that I think they make you take the test
unless is your license expired
oh well you better get a hold of your self
