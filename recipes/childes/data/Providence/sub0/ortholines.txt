uhhuh he lost his button

yeah probably

and what did he find on the mattress
dyou remember
he found a button
and he pulled it off
there he is there's a picture of him
right
what's he doing
he lost his button yeah
Corduroy is a bear
who once lived in the toy department of a big store
day after day he waited with all the other animals and dolls for somebody to come along and take him home
what's there there's a giraffe and a doll
bunny rabbit and a
what's that
yeah it's a clown
the store was always full of shoppers buying all sort of things
but noone ever seemed to want a small bear in green overalls
then one morning a little girl stopped and looked straight into Corduroy's bright eyes
oh mommy she said look
there's the very bear I've always wanted
not today dear her mother sighed
I've spent too much already
besides he doesn't look new
he's lost the button to his overalls
Corduroy watched them sadly as they walked away
I didn't know I'd lost a button he said to himself
tonight I'll go and see if I can find it
what did he do
late that evening when all the shoppers had gone and the doors were shut and locked Corduroy climbed carefully down from his shelf and began searching everywhere on the floor for his lost button
uhoh what's that Ethan
an escalator
suddenly he felt the floor moving under him
quite by accident he had stepped on an escalator and up he went
could this be a mountain he wondered
I think I've always wanted to climb a mountain
is it a mountain Ethan
no what is it
yeah it's the escalator
he stepped off the escalator as it reached the next floor
and there before his eyes was a most amazing sight
tables and chairs and lamps and sofas
and rows and rows of
beds
this must be a palace Corduroy gasped
I guess I've always wanted to live in a palace
he wandered around admiring the furniture
Bob wants to read the story
this must be a bed he said
I've always wanted to sleep in a bed
and up he crawled onto the large thick mattress
all at once he saw something small and round
what did he think it was
hmm
what did he think it was
why there's my button he cried and he tried to pick it up
but like all the other buttons
on the mattress it was tied down tight
and then what happened Ethan
he yanked and pulled with both paws until
pop
off came the button and off the mattress Corduroy toppled
bang into a lamp
over it fell with a crash
yep there's Corduroy
Corduroy didn't know it but there was someone else awake in the store
the night watchman was going on his rounds on the floor above
when he heard the crash he came dashing down the escalator
now who in the world did that he said
somebody must be hiding around here
he flashed his light around sofas and beds until he came to the biggest bed of all
and there he saw two fuzzy brown ears sticking out from under the cover
who was it
who's that hiding
Corduroy
hello he said
how did you get upstairs
and the watchman tucked Corduroy under his arm and carried him down the escalator
and put him on a shelf in the toy department with all the other animals and dolls
what are they doing Ethan
they are sleeping that's right
Corduroy was just waking up when the first customers came into the store in the morning
there looking at him with a wide warm smile was the same girl
he'd seen only the day before
I'm Lisa she said and you are going to be my very own bear
last night I counted
mhm
I counted what I saved in my piggy bank
do you have a piggy bank too
yup it's upstairs
that's right
and it has lots of money in it
and my mother said I could bring you home
shall I put him in a box for you the sales lady asked
no thank you
no thank you said Lisa
and she carried Corduroy home in her arms
she ran all the way up four flights of stairs into her family's apartment and straight into her own room
Corduroy blinked
there was a chair
an a dresser
and next to a girl sized bed
what was next to a girl sized bed
yep that's right a little bed just for him
yup for me
this must be home he said
I know I've always wanted a home
Lisa sat down with Corduroy on her lap and began to sew a button on his overalls
I like you the way you are she said
but you'll be more comfortable with your shoulder strap fastened
you must be a friend said Corduroy
I've always wanted a friend
