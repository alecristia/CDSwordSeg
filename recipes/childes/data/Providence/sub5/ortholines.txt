that's the special pillow
today is
are you hiding
ah let's see twenty twenty one twenty two Monday September twenty third
is that a bed
today is Monday September twenty third and
we are in the new house and we are playing legos and we just finished having a big snack and playing with crayons
okay let's play legos again
good idea
yeah I have a microphone
you have one too
yeah I'm bringing the legos over here
in fact
let's play with the legos right up here
so just as a little preface this is a very this is very much a transition time for Naima since we've only slept in our new house three nights so far
although all our stuff has been here longer than that
and this week we have noticed that Naima
goldenrod
what did we do with the goldenrod
we were digging it
we've noticed Naima using adverbs of time a lot more and accurately some of the time like nursie now she says
or she says it's raining today
and she likes to say a while ago and she likes to say
I think she says yesterday and she has said tomorrow
what's up
raining tomorrow
it's raining today actually
and she's using personal pronoun you and me
mostly you to refer to herself much more frequently
Mommy carry you she'll say that
and it's also a transition time cause we are doing lots of new things and meeting lots of new people just in the last couple weeks
because it's the fall and we started new activities like music class and new music class with new kids in it
we've only been to that twice
and we are at a different group in the library with the big kids
and Naima started a swim class with Daddy and there's new kids in that and it's a new thing to do something with Daddy alone like that
and Naima has a potty now which is right here
which is a very
which is basically a toy right now
so all those things are going on
and there's a lot more sentences and long sentences
things off
you mean the legos
let's play with them up here
can I have the Lego base plate please
ooh

oh the fun to be one book is right there
I don't know where those balls are
did you almost fall over
let's go in Naima's room and read it
