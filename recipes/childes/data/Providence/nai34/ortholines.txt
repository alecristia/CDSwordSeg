on the way home pa stopped at a drug store when he came out he got into a jeep
by mistake see the jeep it's a green jeep
you should be wearing your glasses pa pig
Harry and Sally thought that pa had swapped cars with a soldier
then he went to the supermarket
when he came out he got into a police car
you made a good swap Daddy said Harry but pa wasn't listening and he didn't seemed to be thinking very well either don't you agree
ha look at that police fox
he is blowing a whistle and he's saying stop
stop
that's the pig family in a police car
driving a police car
who's in back of them that's a good question
oh the police fox is chasing them that's right
and then what happens
next he drove to a fruit stand to buy some apples
when he left he took farmer fox's tractor
my but pa is absent minded isn't he
oh there's the tractor

it looks as though he is very angry that means mad
with that someone who took his power shovel

Roger please be careful you are squeezing ma's little car just a little bit too tightly
well let's all hope that pa pig will never again make that many mistakes in one day
hmm
he's mad
he's bringing the pig's car back to them cause he wants to get his steam shovel
pa pig took the steam shovel by accident
it's over here
she is very surprised and looks like Loly Worm's right here in the maw of the steam shovel

that pig is worrying because the boat that he's in is about to sink
she's very surprised
the steam shovel is almost knocking her over
by accident
those are the pig children they are watching their daddy drive the steam shovel
let's see what else's in the here
these are different stories
I wanna look for a different story
oh here's a Loly Worm story okay let's go back and stick this one
the story is called the talking bread
Humper Dink the baker was mixing bread dough with the help of able baker Charlie Mouse
this little girl Flossy watch them squish and squash the dough
they are making dough for bread
you've seen me do that haven't you
yes I use a rolling pin when I make bread
that's the dough that's a lot of dough look at all the
they are kneading the dough
they patted it into loaves of all different shapes and sizes
balls yep bowls are like balls
then Humper Dink
that pig's name is Humper Dink put the uncooked loaves of bread in the hot oven to bake
that's the oven
they are putting the bread dough into the oven to bake it
okay what happens over here
after the loaves
look at all that bread on the wagon
there must be twenty loaves of bread there
after the loaves had finished baking Humper Dink set them out on the table to cool
oh here you are right on Mommy's microphone I didn't realize that
mm mm mm fresh bread smells good
Mama Humper Dink says Mama
let me just adjust this okay okay
Mama
that's what he says he's surprised
Mama
finally he took out the last loaf
listen did you hear that one when he pick that loaf it said oh it said Mama
huh but everybody knows that bread can't talk
the bread is talking Naima
it must be haunted
huh help police Humper Dink picked up Flossy and ran from the room
I must telephone Sargent Murphy he said
the bread said Mama
sergeant Murphy
that's the police dog
arrived in a hurry
he is driving the motorcycle without his shoes on and his shoes are tied to the end of the motorcycle
cause he was in such a hurry
he reached down and picked up the loaf of haunted bread
Mama
oh my goodness the bread is saying Mama
the bread is talking
Murphy was so startled he fell into the mixing trough
that's where the dough is
he fell into the dough
look at what a mess he is huh
at just that moment Huckle and Loly came into the bakery
who's gonna get him out is right I don't know who's gonna get him out
somebody had better get him out he is going to be all sticky and messy and gooey
that is a very strange loaf of bread
said Loly

he took a nibble the bread said nothing he nibbled and nibbled til only his foot showing
he went into the bread
and still the bread said nothing
Mama
