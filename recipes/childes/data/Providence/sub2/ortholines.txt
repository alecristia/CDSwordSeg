corn flakes
he liked to tie knots in the sleeves of her pretty dresses
he bored poured blue paint in her yellow paint jar and yellow paint in her blue paint jar

after that he put her favorite fuzzy bunny blanket in the freezer
what happens when you put something in the freezer
yeah it gets cold and hard too
at bedtime he hid under her bed and yelled

then one night
when Honey Bunny was fast asleep p j painted her face bright green
Mom cried Honey Bunny in the morning look what p j did
Mr Funny Bunny was very angry

you were a very bad bunny Mrs Funny Bunny said
after that things were very different at the Funny Bunny house
Honey Bunny had her corn flakes with

Honey Bunny sat down by the window
she did not want to paint
she did not want to play dolls

Honey Bunny just stared at hers
when it was time for bed Honey Bunny's fuzzy bunny blanket was soft and warm
but Honey Bunny did not care
yeah her ears are big too
well they are bunnies bunnies have big ears
Honey Bunny looked under her bed

Mrs Funny Bunny looked at Honey Bunny then she smiled
what should she say

Mrs Funny Bunny took Honey Bunny to the bathroom
she lifted her up in front of the mirror
Honey Bunny could not believe her eyes
her face was painted blue with
yellow polka dots

Poppleton's house grew very long icicles in the winter
you are right in Poppleton the Pig there were no icicles because it was spring or summer
it was hot out
and it has to be cold to have icicles
Poppleton was proud of them
mhm
he never knocked them down
he just let them get longer and longer
Gus
who's Gus
right the mail carrier said Poppleton you should do something about those icicles
Hudson down the street said Poppleton those icicles are not pretty
who's that
that's right
and when Poppleton's mother visited she said that an icicle was surely going to
bonk him on the head
what
that's right
he has a ruler to measure them
but Poppleton didn't listen to any of them
he loved his icicles
every morning he took a ruler outside to see how much longer they had grown
a roller
that's different
that's like Rolly huh
this is a ruler

it's a long think snake
a snake's head
snakes don't really have heads
they
just keeps going and going and going and at its very end of the snake's body
there's a mouth
and two eyes
and snakes have very long tongues
so we hafta make a tongue
sticking out of
the mouth
there we go
he's going on
whoops the tongue fell out
wanna make it bigger
now can you shut it
maybe when he goes to sleep he shuts his mouth
now you are putting it all over your pants
this Play Doh is just too crumbly
you wanna make a belly button again

that's important too
we have a window in our bathroom

mm fits in doesn't it
but he can't dump it the way Dumpy can dump the sand
that's a good idea
where's the construction zone
let's
let's pretend they are building a city over here
and this
they are building all kinds of buildings
most of the buildings don't have roofs yet
they need some roofs
so the trucks are working hard
to put the roofs on the buildings
where's that that one
the bigger one there we go
we might need some sand too
because they are going to build a play ground
hmm
where's
where are we gonna build the sandbox
you know where I think a good place to build a sandbox is right over here because it looks like a park
there are lots of trees
so we'll clear some of these things out of the way
Harold's gonna help
how is he gonna get through the tunnel
we need to attach him I have a way to attach him
I think there's a seat belt over here
I saw a seat belt in this box over here huh
let's see is there a seatbelt in here
yeah
I'm just looking for a seatbelt
to attach Bob to his scooper
hmm
crayons
what you doing honey bunny boo

wanna try to attach him
want this
you had Bob now we need scoop
mixed up
there you can mix them up even more
oh
okay
you gonna try to take that part off
there you go
doesn't the red
does the red front go with the red back
or there's the red front
no it's front to front
which way does the car go
this way this way this way this way this way this way
this way this way this way this way
mhm
I don't know
it's like playing tug of war again
mhm

that's the backhoe
I was trying to mix it up
wanna mix it up with a fire truck

oh you are gonna really mix it up this time
we could even mix it up with the trains too
that's still a dumptruck isn't it
but it could be a dump mix truck
a mix dump
let's try the potty
yeah it's still a dumptruck
it just has a different cab up front huh
uhhuh
yeah but the cabs look almost the same except for the color of the circle huh
mhm
that's right and one circle is
is there another circle
does this one have a circle yeah
that's right
I don't know if that comes off honey
I could take this off
that's nothing now
but when you put that on
it's a signal it's a crossing gate right
is that what it's called
crossing gate
there you go big sigh
a digger
that's really a backhoe
because a backhoe has two
oh no you are right it's just a digger
then when you put this on together with it it's a backhoe
I think
a backhoe has two shovels
one in the front and one in the back
mm let's see
that's just a digger
let's try the potty
oops
attach it
see this one has little special places to attach it
this one doesn't
we can try and attach it but I don't think it
