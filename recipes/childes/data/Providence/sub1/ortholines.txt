now where's Scuffy
Scuffy the tugboat
who's looking down
mhm
Scuffy was sad
Scuffy was grumpy
Scuffy sniffed his blue smokestack
the toystore is no place for a red painted tugboat said Scuffy
he sniffed his blue smokestack again
I was meant for bigger things
he's in a toystore
perhaps you would not be grumpy if you went sailing said the man with the polka dot tie
there he is
who owned the toystore
so one night he took Scuffy home to his little boy
he filled the bathtub with water
sail little tugboat said the little boy
I won't sail in a bathtub said Scuffy
a tub is no place for a red painted tugboat
I was meant for bigger things
the next day the man with the polka dot tie and his little boy carried Scuffy to a river
sail little tugboat said the man with the polka dot tie
and what did he do Ethan
it was full of water
and Scuffy moved along quickly down the stream down the river
come back little tugboat come back
cried the little boy
not I tooted Scuffy not I
this is the life for me
he keeps going
all that day Scuffy sailed along with the stream
past cows and women washing clothes
Scuffy almost got hit by a cow
that was not fun
night came and the moon came out
there was nothing to see but the quiet trees
suddenly an owl called out
hoot hoot
toot toot
cried the little tugboat
he was scared
he wanted to see the man with the polka dot tie
the next morning Scuffy moved on
he saw two streams
to make a big river
Scuffy sailed down the river
he sailed past villages
he sailed past men with logs
what are they doing Ethan
they are gonna get the logs ready for the logging truck
this is a fine river said Scuffy but it's very busy and big for me
he sailed under some bridges
the river got deeper and wider and now there were big cities
and big boats
the river got deeper and deeper and deeper and it moved faster and faster
then it started to rain and Scuffy was riding on the waves
up and down
lots and lots and lots of rain
people had to bring cranes and put sand bags by the river
because the river was getting bigger and bigger and bigger and higher and higher and higher
and there's Scuffy all alone
on went the river to the sea
at last Scuffy sailed into a big city
here the river got wider and there were docks and wharves and big ships
it was a big noisy place
and cranes loaded freight onto some ships
Scuffy said toot toot
but nobody saw him the little tugboat
oh no said Scuffy when he saw the great big ocean
there's no beginning and no end to the sea
I wish I could find the man with the polka dot tie and
yup there's a red truck and what's that
yep it goes all the way to the dock
just then just as the little red tugboat sailed past the last piece of land a hand reached out
mm there's a lot of smoke coming out of those ships isn't there
that's Scuffy again
he's all by himself
but look who picked him up
who picked him up
the man with the polka dot tie and the little boy
and he said I wanna go home to the bathtub
that's just the right size for me
the end
there's Scuffy again yup
and there's the little red engine
little engine that could
I think I can
I think I can
a coal car yes he does
there's some coal
mhm Scuffy the tugboat
that's right
and who else
yup the little engine that could
and there's Scuffy again
mm there's a collie dog
and we know that story too
what was his name
the tawny scrawny lion
yep there's a rabbit
and there's a
what's that
kitty cat
Scuffy the tugboat

Peter saw his dog Willie coming
quick as a wink
he hid in an empty box
lying on the sidewalk
wouldn't it be funny if I whistled Peter thought
Willie would stop and look all around to see who it was
Peter tried again to whistle
but still he couldn't
so Willie just walked on
Peter got out of the box and started home
on the way home he took some colored chalks out of his pocket and
drew a long long line
look at that
he drew it right around the girls jumping rope
and still he's drawing it
joop
joop
right up to his door
he stood there and tried to whistle again
he blew until his cheeks were tired but
nothing happened
he went into his house and put on his father's old hat
to make himself feel more grown up
he looked in then to the mirror to practice whistling
still no whistle
when his mother saw what he was doing
Peter pretended that he was his father
he said I've come home early today dear is Peter here
his mother answered
why no he's outside with Willie
well I'll go out and look for them said Peter
he's pretending to be his daddy
first he walked along a crack in the sidewalk
then he tried to run away from his shadow
there's his shadow
he jumped off his shadow
but when he landed
they were together again
he came to the corner where the box was and who should he see but
Willie
Peter scrambled under the box he blew
and blew
and
suddenly out came a real whistle
Willie stopped and looked around to see who it was

Harold and the purple crayon
one evening
after thinking it over for some time
Harold decided to go for a walk in the
moonlight
there wasn't any moon
and Harold
needed a moon oh
needed a moon for a walk in the moonlight
and he needed something to walk on
he made a long straight path so he wouldn't get lost
and he set off on his walk taking his big purple crayon with him
there it is
but he didn't seem to be getting anywhere on the long straight path
so he left the path for a shortcut across a field
and the moon went with him
the shortcut led right to where Harold thought a forest ought to be
he didn't want to get lost in the woods so he made a very small forest with
just one tree in it
that's right
it turned out to be an
yep
the apples would be very tasty Harold thought when they got red
so he put a
yep a frightening dragon under the tree to guard the apples
it was a terrible frightening dragon
it even frightened Harold he backed away
his hand holding the purple crayon
shook
yep
suddenly he realized
that's right your hands are shaking
that's right he's falling right into the water
by then Harold was over his head
in an ocean hmm
mhm
just like you were in the ocean the other day
he came up thinking fast
and
thinking fast and thinking big heh
he's thinking a lot yep
he has to think a lot because he has a lot of adventures so he has to
he has to
protect himself
and in no time at all he was climbing aboard a
a trim little boat
he quickly set sail
and the moon sailed along with him
mhm
and what did he draw
mhm
the sailboat
after he had sailed long enough Harold made land without much trouble
he stepped ashore on the beach
mhm
wondering where he was
where was he
right
the sandy beach reminded Harold of
yep picnics
and the thought of picnics made him hungry so he laid out a nice simple picnic lunch what was his lunch
yep lots of pies
there was nothing but pie
but they were all nine kinds of pie that Harold liked best
when Harold finished his picnic there was quite a lot left
he hated so to see so much pie go to waste so Harold left
mhm and a
yep the moose is gonna eat the pie up and what is the other animal he left
a porcupine a deserving porcupine to finish it up
and off he went looking for a hill to climb to see where he was
mhm a moose and a porcupine they are gonna finish up all the pie
Harold knew that the higher up he went the farther he could see
so he decided to make the hill into a
yep mountain
if he went high enough he thought he could see the window of his bedroom
he was tired and he felt he ought to be getting to bed
he hoped he could see his bedroom window from the top of the mountain
but what happened
as he looked down over the other side he
yep he slipped
and there wasn't any other side of the mountain he was falling in
thin air but luckily
right he kept his wits and his purple crayon
he made a balloon and he grabbed on to it
and he made a basket under the balloon big enough to stand in
he had a fine view from the balloon but he couldn't see his window
no I can see your window right over there right over there too
you have two windows in your bedroom
and usually the moon is
we can see the moon out that window
at night
he couldn't even see a house
so he made a house
with windows
two houses yup
and he landed the balloon on the grass in the front
looks like your house
none of the windows was his window
he tried to think where his window ought to be
he made some more windows
he made a big building full of windows
he made lots of buildings full of windows
he made a whole city full of windows
it does look like New York City and there's the moon it's still there
but none of the windows was his window
he couldn't think where it might be
yep
that's right
he decided to ask a policeman
the policeman pointed the way Harold was going anyway
but Harold thanked him
he followed the way
as he walked a
and he walked along with the moon wishing he was in his room and in bed
you gonna walk straight to your bed
then suddenly Harold remembered
he remembered where his bedroom window was when there was a moon
going to your bed
just like Harold did
the purple and brown book that's what color it is
mixed up
like your color and like your eyes are a little bit blue
and a little bit green
now this book is a lot brown and some purple
a different color purple
that's a color purple and that's a different color purple
he remembered where his bedroom window was when there was a moon it was always right around the moon
that's right
we are both wearing stripes Ethan
my shirt is stripy and your shirt is stripy
you wanna mix our shirts together
mix mix mix mix mix
and then we would have a new stripy shirt
and then Harold made his bed
he got in it
and he drew up the covers
the purple crayon dropped on the floor and Harold dropped off to sleep
