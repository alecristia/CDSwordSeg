little miss spider popped pout of her egg
swinging down from a thread she hung on by one leg
watching brothers and sisters all scooting for cover
she dangled there wondering where is my mother
did she squeeze down a hole or dive under water
why won't she come out here and meet her new daughter
she climbed to the tippy top of a tree
gazing out on the world she sobbed where can mom be
a beetle named Betty buzzed by this high perch
a child needs a mother may I please help you search
that's beetle Betty
I don't know for sure but
yeah I don't know for but she doesn't know that
I don't know for sure but I'll offer this clue if I were your mother I'd be looking for you
they flew through the trees spying down from the sky
and asked all the butterflies fluttering by
but none of the insects they happened upon had any idea where her mother had gone
that is a lady bug
she then asked a small spider as plump as a pig
have you seen my mom she's like me only big
the sly spider laughed
that is a spider
as he gobbled his snack
up there is a mother who's yellow and black
with a heart full of joy she peered over the straw
but it wasn't her mother that miss spider saw
it was six hungry hatchlings and a goldfinch who cried
your dinner is here darlings so open up wide
yikes
oh they think miss spider is their dinner
before she could
she was whisked out of sight and Brave Bittle Brave Beetle Betty was hugging her tight
oh goodness
Betty saved her
in her warm cozy home
she did
in her warm cozy home in the bark of a tree
the kind beetle asked won't you stay here with me
then miss
then miss spider smiled and held Betty fast
I looked for my mom and I found you at last
for finding your mother there's one certain test
you must look for the creature who loves you the
best

I'd take a vacation fly off for a rest
if I could find someone to stay on my nest
if I could find someone I'd fly away free
do you wanna read Chester's way instead
okay
Chester's way
Chester had his own way of doing things
he always cut his sandwiches diagonally
he always got out of bed on the same side
and he never left the house without double knotting his shoes
Chester always had the same thing for breakfast
toast with jam and peanut butter
and he always carried a miniature first aid kit in his back pocket
just in case
you definitely have a mind of your own said Chester's mother
that's one way to put it said Chester's father
Chester's best friend Wilson was exactly the same way
that's why they were best friends
Chester wouldn't play baseball unless Wilson played and they never swung at the first pitch or slid head first
Wilson wouldn't ride his bicycle unless Chester wanted to and they always used hand signals
if Chester was hungry Wilson was to
but they rarely ate between meals
some days I can't tell those two apart said Wilson's mother
me either said Wilson's father
Chester and Wilson Wilson and Chester
that's the way it was
they loved to go on picnics
once when Wilson accidentally swallowed a watermelon seed and cried because he was afraid a watermelon plant would grow inside him
Chester swallowed one to
don't worry said Chester if you grow a watermelon plant I'll grow one to
Chester duplicated his Christmas list every year and gave a copy to Wilson because they always wanted to same things anyway
for Halloween they would always dress as things that went together
salt and pepper shakers two mittens on a string
ham and eggs
they really are two peas in a pod said Chester's mother
looks like it Chester's father
in spring Chester and Wilson shared the same umbrella
in winter they never threw snowballs at each other
in fall they raked leaves together
and in summer they reminded each other to wear sun screen to they wouldn't burn
Chester and Wilson Wilson and Chester
that's the way it was
and then Lily moved into the neighborhood
Lily had her own way of doing things
let's not hurt your teeth okay honey
she wore bandaids all over her arms and legs to look brave
she talked backwards to herself sometimes so no one would know what she was saying
and she never left the house without one of her nifty disguises
Lily waved at all the cars that passed by even if she didn't know who was in them
and she always carried a loaded squirt gun in her back pocket just in case
she definitely has a mind of her own said Chester
that's one way to put it said Wilson
when Lily asked Chester and Wilson to play they said they were busy
when she called them at home they disguised their voices and said they weren't home
if Lily was walking on one side of the street Chester and Wilson crossed to the other side and hid
she's something else said Chester
looks like it said Wilson
one day when Chester and Wilson were practicing their hand signals
some older boys rode by
well those are some older boys who rode by and they circled
well that's an older boy and he's not very nice
that's Wilson and Chester
and that's an older boy
and that's an older boy
Chester and Wilson didn't know what to do
right
Chester and Wilson didn't know what to do
just when they were about to give up hope a fierce looking cat with horrible fangs jumped out of the bushes and frightened the older boys away
are you who I think you are Chester asked the cat
of course the cat replied
thank you Lily said Chester
thank you cat
you are welcome Chester said Lily
thank you Lily said Wilson
right
she was
you are welcome Wilson said Lily
I'm glad you were wearing a disguise said Chester
and I'm glad you had your squirt gun said Wilson
I always do said Lily
just in case
afterward Chester invited Lily over for lunch
you have a muscle mouse cup said Lily
of course said Chester
I do too
right there see he's holding his cup
oh her her cup must be at her house
Chester and Wilson cut their sandwiches diagonally
Lily asked Chester's mother if she had cookie cutters and she made stars and flowers and bells
mhm
and a flower right
is that a flower shape sort of
right
right
mhm
right
that night Lily invited Chester and Wilson to sleep over
you have a night light said Chester
of course said Lily
right there
wow
Chester and Wilson wanted toast with jam and peanut butter for breakfast the next morning
boring said Lily
try this instead
wow this is good said Chester
wow said Wilson
after that when Lily asked Chester and Wilson to play they said yes
right
that's right
sometimes I can't tell these three apart said Lily's mother
me either said Lily's father
Chester and Wilson and Lily Lily and Wilson and Chester
that's the way it was
right right
drums
you are right
you are right
Chester has a purple balloon
Wilson has a pink balloon and a drum
Lily has a broom
you are absolutely right
for Halloween they dressed as the three blind mice
for Christmas Lily gave Chester and Wilson nifty disguises
well I think this is Chester because he's brown
this is Lily because she's white
and this is Wilson because he's grey
right right Chester right Chester is wearing one of Lily's boots
and Wilson is wearing the other one of Lily's boots
you have a drippy lollie
right a big picture
in spring Chester Wilson and Lily shared the same umbrella
in winter they never threw snowballs at each other
in fall they raked leaves together
and in summer they reminded each other to wear sun screen so they wouldn't burn
Chester and Wilson and Lily
Lily and Wilson and Chester

guess what I bought with the money they gave me

that's his little key chain

everyone at school wanted it
but it was mine
I was scared someone would steal it
I'm not dumb
I knew the perfect place to hide it
I put the key chain in my mouth

suddenly I felt very sick
our teacher was worried

but I didn't answer
I was
oh he swallowed his key chain
oh he swallowed his key chain and now he was a tummy ache
my teacher called an ambulance
and the ambulance people put me on a stretcher
they asked me what happened but I still didn't want to tell
well his name is Mike
and I think his name is Joe
think so
yeah
it was a little hard to explain why I put a key chain in my mouth
they took me to the hospital
I had a big room all to myself
the nurse took off my white scarf and put a white gown on me
don't worry she said we'll take good care of you
it won't hurt
but I was still a little scared
especially when she took me to the x ray room
he's a little bit scared
looking for him
and there he was
hi she said I'm Isabelle
and I'm Vik he told her
Isabelle and Vik had lots of fun together
Isabelle told silly stories and Vik whistled like a bird
he knew how to cross his eyes too
I wish I could do that Isabelle said laughing
then Vik said let's go to Rhino city and you can meet all of my friends
in Rhino city everyone stared at Isabelle
they whispered to each other an elephant in Rhino city
how very strange
lady Rataxes was terribly angry
you cannot be friends with that little elephant she told her son
king Rataxes ordered Isabelle to leave at once
and don't come back
we don't like elephants in Rhino city he shouted
Isabelle walked back to Celeste Ville
she felt so sad
would she ever see her new friend again
Vik was unhappy too
the very next day he snuck out of Rhino city to look for Isabelle
Isabelle had the same idea and it was not long before they found each other

yeah
we go over the little bridge
and we see the lake
yeah
look there's an island Isabelle pointed
let's land there
Isabelle and Vik hurried ashore to go exploring
follow me Vik said
what kind of bird does that look like
it does look just like a flamingo
you are right
Isabelle and Vik played toss the coconut and hide and seek
what do you do when you play hide and seek
do you count to ten and say ready or not here I come
hmm hmm
suddenly a strong wind started to blow
the sky grew dark and it began to rain
Isabelle and Vik ran back to the boat
but it was gone
how will we ever get home cried Isabelle as they searched for the lost boat
don't worry Isabelle said Vik trying to sound brave
you are my friend and I won't let anything bad happen to you
we'll find the boat
oh look cried Vik there it is
Mister Mister Isabelle shouted that's our boat
I know you the hippo told Isabelle
you are Babar's little girl
I'm Murphy Heavy Bottom
oh I remember you Isabelle said
this is my friend Vik
nice to meet you Vik Murphy replied
hop aboard I'll tow you back to the mainland
the hippo took Isabelle and Vik back to his house
Missus Heavy Bottom was there to welcome them
you need to dry off she said and then we will call your parents so they will not worry
what's Murphy wearing
it looks like underpants
it might even be a bathing suit since he was swimming right
yeah
Missus Heavy Bottom gave them towels
Isabelle pretended hers was a long flowing gown
I am the queen she told Vik
and I must be King said Vik
soon the sun came out
Isabelle and Vik played with a telescope while they waited for their clothes to dry
I can see Celeste Ville from here said Vik
I think that's Isabelle's dress
it's drying
because it was so wet
right
yeah
oh I bet you are right
and what is Vik looking at
what's he holding
what's he looking into

ah looks like he's wearing his underpants

there was a water slide on the side of the house and Isabelle and Vik took turns
let's see who can make the biggest splash said Vik
me first Isabelle laughed and down she went
whoosh
then the hippo came to the window
come inside said Murphy it's time to go
I've tried to call your parents but there's no answer
I'll take you home myself
first we'll go to Rhino City and then we'll go to Celeste Ville he told the two friends and off they went
they had not gone far when Isabelle said wait I hear voices
it was Babar and Rataxes
Celeste and lady Rataxes were there too
everyone had been searching for the children and now they were arguing
what have you done with Vik shouted Rataxes
I bet he's with Babar's little girl said Lady Rataxes
Babar shook his head angrily
I have no idea where Vik is he said
I'm looking for Isabelle and I'm as worried as you are
the children ran to their parents
here we are they cried
thank you so much for bringing the children back safely Babar said to Murphy
but lady Rataxes was still angry
keep your daughter away from our son she said
let's get home now said Babar
and as they drove off towards Celeste Ville Isabelle waved
bless you
Isabelle waved to her friend
and Vik waved back
Isabelle couldn't stop thinking about her friend
do you think I'll ever see Vik again Isabelle asked her father that evening
I hope so said Babar
he's a nice little boy
sure enough the very next day there was a tap at the window

one morning Ariel the Little Mermaid went looking for hidden treasure with her best friend
Flounder
Ariel was supposed to sing for the first time in front of her father king Triton and all the other mer people
but for now she was much more interested in sunken ships than her father's concert
while they were searching Flounder began to get nervous
what was that he said
did you hear something
suddenly a very large
shark smashed through the side of the ship
swim a shark Flounder cried
they swam away very quickly
Ariel and Flounder found a safe spot where the shark couldn't reach them
you big bully Flounder shouted at the shark
as soon as she was sure they were a safe distance from the shark Ariel thanked Flounder for being so brave
even though he was a very small fish he had a very big heart and he was Ariel's best friend under the sea
after their adventure Ariel and Flounder headed home hoping that they would not be too late for her father's concert
ooh it's a big concert
what's the octopus playing
right
and what's Sebastian doing
what is he
he's the conductor and he's conducting the orchestra
and these fish are all playing horns
and what does she have on her head

Cinderella
what's the story called
The Dance lesson
just imagine said Cinderella excitedly there's a ball at the palace tonight in honor of the prince and every maiden in the land is invited
that means me too
all of Cinderella's friends clapped and chirped as they gathered around
they loved their Cinderellee
oh dear said Cinderella with a sigh there's so much to do
I can only go if I've finished my chores and today Stepmother has given me more work than ever
there's washing mending ironing cooking scrubbing sweeping
suddenly three loud shrieks came from downstairs
Cinderella come down here immediately and help us get ready for the ball her stepsisters cried
her cruel stepmother and stepsisters wouldn't give poor Cinderella any time to do the rest of her chores
mend my dress screeched Anastasia
polish my shoes whined Rosella
iron my cloak demanded her stepmother
are they nice
no they are not so nice
but is Cinderella nice
she's nice
and are Cinderella's friends nice
yes
hours later Cinderella began to sweep and scrub the endless stone floor
suddenly Jack had an idea
I know he said
we'll help Cinderella
all the other mice nodded in agreement
what would I do without you she said patting each of them on the head
you are so good to me
everyone joined in the cleaning singing happily as they went
as she worked Cinderella began to imagine the magical evening ahead
everyone would be dressed in the finest clothes and Cinderella would wear her mother's beautiful gown
the ballroom would come alive with music dancing and laughter and the prince would bow before Cinderella and ask her to dance
suddenly Cinderella stopped dreaming
oh no she cried I've never been to a ball
I don't even know how to dance
dontchu worry Cinderella Jacques smiled reassuringly
we'll show you how to dance easy as pie
with that Jack bowed before Perla and extended his hand
dance please Missy he asked
Perla blushed as she took Jack's hand
Gus was the conductor and he got all the birds to sing
Jack and Perla spun round and around gliding across the floor
Cinderella watched and copied their movements
just listen and move see said Perla
not so scary
using her broom as an imaginary partner Cinderella danced and twirled gracefully through the room
she led everyone across the floor sweeping and cleaning as they went
good Cinderella said Jack beaming
lucky prince gets to dance with Cinderellee
the mice collapsed on the floor laughing
lets
oh there's Ariel
a Special surprise
the underwater kingdom was quiet and peaceful
every mermaid and merman was in bed fast asleep
everyone except princess Ariel and her friend Flounder
hurry up Flounder cried Ariel
it's almost time for the party
we can't be late
trying not to make sound Ariel and Flounder swam away from king Triton's palace
they began their journey toward the surface
but Ariel said Flounder are you sure we should go to the surface
remember last time
your father got so angry
you know how he feels about humans
that's right this time we can't get caught said Ariel
she wasn't to let anything ruin her plans for tonight
prince Eric the prince Ariel had saved in a shipwreck was having a royal ball
and Ariel had a very special surprise for him
swim faster Flounder she cried glancing back at him
and Flounder raced to catch up
just as Ariel and Flounder approached the surface Ariel saw beautiful lights dance across the water
I don't think anyone's wearing yellow there are they
no
what do you think's happening
well I guess prince Eric is out on the balcony
he just didn't feel like joining in the royal celebration
he could
Melody is crying
yeah

when they had the party for Melody she didn't wanna be at the party either did she
she just wanted to go swimming right
yeah
she went back in the sea again
yeah
she was happy there right
did she go with Sebastian
yeah
Sebastian fell in the water again
yeah
prince Eric stood on the palace balcony
he couldn't stop thinking about the mysterious girl with the lovely voice who had saved his life
Flounder spotted the prince first
look Ariel he said pointing a fin at the castle
Ariel's heart leapt with joy when she saw Prince Eric
it's time for my surprise she said winking at Flounder
swimming up to a nearby rock Ariel and Flounder hid behind it
ready asked Flounder
with a nod Ariel closed her eyes opened her mouth and began to sing
suddenly the night was filled with the sweet sound of Ariel's voice
she sang a song she had written just for Eric
it was Ariel's special gift for him
hearing her beautiful voice again Eric's face lit up
it can't be he said
I must be hearing the sounds of the wind
still he remained on the balcony enchanted by the beautiful song
when the song was over Eric looked out across the sea
he hoped to catch a glimpse of the wonderful girl who had saved him
who are you he called out into the night
but all he heard was the echo of his own voice
I'll be back soon Ariel whispered as she and Flounder swam toward home

what's Corduroy looking for
I donno
tadah
tadah
tadah
oh my gosh what do you say
you are welcome
please
hmm
what's this book about
Corduroy
is Corduroy a little bear
what's he wearing
is he wearing overalls
yes
what color are they
oh
late one summer afternoon Lisa and her mother took their laundry to the laundromat
as always on such trips Lisa took along her toy bear Corduroy
a laundromat was a busy place at this hour
now Corduroy you sit right here and wait for me Lisa said
I'm going to help with our wash
Corduroy waited patiently then he suddenly perked up his ears
Lisa's mother was saying be sure to take everything out of your pockets Lisa dear
you don't want your precious things to get all wet and soapy
pockets said Corduroy to himself
I don't have a pocket
he slid off the chair
I must go find something to make a pocket out of he said and he began to look around
first he came to a pile of fancy towels and wash cloths but nothing was the right size or color
then he saw a huge stack of colorful clothes in a laundry basket
there ought to be something in there to make a pocket out of he said
without hesitating he climbed inside the bag which was filled with pieces of wet laundry
the dampness didn't bother Corduroy in the least
this must be a cave he said sighing happily
I've always wanted to live in a dark cool cave
when the time came for Lisa to fetch her bear he was gone
oh Mommy she said Corduroy isn't here where I left him
I'm sorry Honey said her mother but the Laundromat will be closing soon and we must be getting home
Lisa was reluctant to leave without Corduroy but her mother insisted
you can come back tomorrow she said
I'm sure he will still be here
as they left a young man wearing an artist's beret was taking his wet laundry out of a bag a very bad Corduroy had discovered
before he knew it Corduroy was being tossed together with all the sheets and shirts and shorts and slacks
into the dryer
but just as the artist was shutting the glass door Corduroy tumbled out onto the floor
how in thunder did that bear ever get mixed up with my things the artist wondered
poor Corduroy was damp all over
the least I can do for him is give his overalls a good drying said the man thoughtfully
he unbuttoned Corduroy's shoulder straps and put his overalls in the dryer
Corduroy grew dizzy as he watched the clothes spinning round but the artist became inspired
this would make a wonderful painting he said as he took out his sketch pad and began drawing the swirling colors
I can hardly wait to get back to my studio
finally the dryer stopped whirling and the man gathered up the clothes
and he helped Corduroy put on his warm dry overalls
all at once the manager of the laundromat called closing time everybody out
Corduroy was gently placed on top of a washing machine
I wonder who that bear belongs to said the artist as he was leaving
it seems to me he should have his name someplace
he's too fine a fellow to be lost
as soon as the lights were turned off Corduroy began searching
began his search again
he was surprised to see something white glowing in the dark
what is it
maybe it's snow he said
I've always wanted to play in the snow
he accidentally tipped over the open lidded box and suddenly he was covered in soft slippery soap flakes
it's soap
gradually Corduroy began to slip and slide
what fun he said with a smile
I've always wanted to ski down a steep mountainside
he landed paws first in an empty laundry basket
this must be a cage he said
I've never wanted to live inside a cage
but by now Corduroy was drowsy and soon he nodded off to
oh he's sleeping
next morning when the manager came to open the door of the laundromat Lisa was waiting
I left something here yesterday she said
may I look around
certainly said the manager
my customers are always leaving things
Lisa was searching under the chairs and in back of the washing machines when he
when he
when she heard the manager call her
is this whatchor looking for
yes he's my best friend shouted Lisa as she came running
she reached in and picked Corduroy out of the basket
so this is where you've been you little rascal she said
it's time I took you home
Lisa thanked the manager and ran out of the door down the street holding Corduroy tightly in her arms
why did you wander away she said
I went looking for a pocket said Corduroy
oh Corduroy why didn't you tell me you wanted a pocket asked Lisa giving him an affectionate squeeze
the very next morning Lisa sewed a pocket on Corduroy's overalls
and here's a card I've made with your name on it for you to keep tucked inside
that's his little pocket
I've always wanted a purple pocket with my name inside said Corduroy as he and Lisa nuzzled noses
that's some thread
that Lisa used to sew the pocket on
wow
that's great
well you want Mommy to pick it out
oh you wanna pick it out
okay
you have to carry your box
you want me to hold your milk
okay
what would be a good book to read
are those good to read

okay Franklin's class trip
Franklin could count by twos and tie his shoes
he had gone with his class to the bakery the fire station and the pet store
today Franklin's class was going to the museum
Franklin was so excited that he could hardly eat his breakfast
the museum had lots of steps and huge doors
wow said Franklin it's big
it has to be said Beaver there are real dinosaurs in there
do you remember in New York we went with grandma and grandpa to the museum with the dinosaurs
yeah that's called the museum of natural history in New York
Beaver had been to the museum before she knew everything about it
big dinosaurs she emphasized
so big that they ate trees for breakfast
Franklin was afraid to ask what dinosaurs ate for lunch
Franklin sat down on the steps
what's wrong asked Snail
Beaver says there are real dinosaurs in the museum
Snail looked alarmed
that sounds scary
and Franklin nodded
we are not gonna get that
in the museum lobby Mister Owl went over the rules
no shouting no running and stay with the group
Mister Owl said Beaver one more thing
watch out for the dinosaurs
Moose and Bear laughed
but Franklin didn't he moved a little closer to Mister Owl
their first stop was the bat cave
it was dark inside
squeaks and squawks filled the air
what's that asked Franklin
Beaver giggled
that's the sound bats make to find their way around
Franklin was relieved that it was bats and not dinosaurs
the class visited the rainforest next
Franklin climbed high into a tree house
he could see the tops of trees
can you spot any dinosaurs asked Snail
Franklin shook his head and climbed down quickly
there was so much to do in the museum that Franklin almost forgot about the dinosaurs
in the medieval room Franklin had fun dressing up like a knight
we saw knights in the other museum in New York at the Metropolitan right
yeah
Franklin even got to dig in a sandy pit
he was the first one to find an arrow head
it was just like being a real archaeologist
wow that's neat
an archaeologist is when you dig in the sand for very old things
yeah
the best part is still to come said Beaver as they sat down in the cafeteria
yes agreed Bear lunch
Mister Owl smiled I think Beaver means the dinosaur exhibit
Franklin gulped I'm too tired to see more I think I'll stay here a while he muttered
me too said Snail
you'll forget about being tired when you see the dinosaurs said Mister Owl
eat up and let's go
reluctantly Franklin and Snail followed the giant footprints down a long leafy corridor
there was a loud roar
the floor shook and so did Franklin
ah
screamed Franklin when he turned the corner
he was looking right into the bony mouth of a tyrannosaurus
Franklin blinked
they are bones
real dinosaur bones
but the dinosaurs aren't even alive
alive giggled Beaver of course not
there hasn't been a live dinosaur for millions of years
you sure make good jokes Franklin
you sure do said Snail
as they were leaving Franklin and his friends walked past the egyptian
the egyptian exhibit
next time said Beaver you should visit the tomb there's a mummy inside
is it real asked Franklin
yeah and it's scary said Beaver
but Franklin wasn't scared
he had a mummy at home
and he hardly could hardly wait to tell her all about his adventures at the museum
yay
can I try one of your cherries
are they good
tasty
sure I can
let's see what we have
let's try these
Auntie gave us these books too and I don't think we've read them yet
Maisy
oh we read Maisy takes a bath right should we read that again
okay can I have another cherry

mm tasty
mm it's Maisy's bath time
she runs the water and puts in some bubbles
and in goes duck
ding dong
oh that's the door bell
Maisy runs downstairs to see who it is who do you think's at the door
oh Tallulah you are right hello Tallulah
Maisy can't play now it's her bath time
what's Tallulah holding
a tennis racket you are right
Maisy runs back upstairs and gets undressed
what's Maisy wearing
underpants wow
Maisy jumps into the bubbly bath
ding dong

it's Tallulah again Maisy's still taking her bath
come and play later
oh where are you going Tallulah

she's going upstairs
Tallulah runs up to the bathroom and takes off her clothes
splash splash Maisy and Tallulah play in the tub
hooray
I did
and the bathtub oh the last page where it has all the pictures of Maisy
wow
sure
do you wanna read this one or this one
this one
Maisy's bedtime
Maisy is sleepy it's time for bed
it's bedtime for Panda too
Maisy closes her bedroom curtains hoots the owl
Maisy washes her face and brushes her teeth
Maisy puts on her pajamas
Maisy gets into bed and reads a story
but where is Panda
is he in the toy box
oh there he is behind the curtain
Maisy turns off the light
but she still isn't ready to go to sleep
hmm
she forgot to use the potty
wow
Panda sits on his potty too
look at that
she's using the potty
and she wears big girl underpants
wow
Maisy's very sleepy now
good night Maisy
good night Panda
that's great
there's the last page with all the pictures
terrific
should we read this
I'll teach my dog one hundred words
you wanna see the
oh fruits and nuts
in late summer and fall trees produce seeds
some come in nuts others
alright you wanna do the cobweb cake
okay hello fruity crumble yummy
fall leaves
okay well Honey I start reading and then you don't like that page maybe oh
mushroom hunt
early fall is the best time to go I didn't know this Honey
early fall is the best time to go hunting for toadstools and mushrooms
we should tell Daddy that
you can find an astonishing variety in fields and forests and even in gardens
toadstools and mushrooms are fungi
these are plants that don't have any leaves or flowers but send tiny threads down into other plants or animal other plants or animal dung and feed on them
some fungi grow on dead leaves and others grow on tree trunks or dead logs
here are some to look for
cepes@sfra
also known as the porcini I believe
has a dark brown cap with pores underneath instead of gills
ooh this is a poisonous one we are not allowed to eat that one
let's see which ones look like the ones that we see
look at that giant puff ball
it's a giant puff ball mushroom
that's very funny
Dryad's Saddle has a pale yellow brown cap with darker scales
and a crimson wax cap is red
that's a honey fungus mushroom
yeah ooh this mushroom is called a stink horn and it has a nasty strong smell P U
yeah
yeah you could
yeah
yeah look at those and these are called Chanterelle mushrooms
mm this is called a parasol
because it looks like an umbrella
Sweetie can you eat some of your
cinnamon toast
look this is all about spiders Honey
uhhuh
is that tasty
uhhuh
the best time to see spiders' webs is early on a fall morning when their fragile threads are strung with beads of dew or mist
spiders spin webs to catch insects
different spiders have different types of webs
hmm
they don't look so nice you don't think
they do
do the spiders look very nice
pretty nice
how small
yeah
that spider's trying to eat that bug
don't ya think
how spiders spin sheet webs in the corners of rooms
you are right
you are right
does that look like a mushroom that might be a spider hiding
planting
mhm
many spring flowers grow from bulbs but you have to plant them in the fall eight to twelve weeks beforehand
you can plant them in a garden or in pots
you can also plant them in indoor pots as long as you keep them in a cool dark place for two to three months
indoor bulbs flower earlier than outdoor ones because it is warmer inside
hmm pretty
chocolate cobweb cake
make this delicious cake for a fall party or celebration
it is very easy
yeah a little spider
all of the ingredients are mixed together in the same bowl
that looks good doesn't it
mhm
yummy
you know what that is
chocolate right
that is a chocolate cake
yummy
yummy
as the days grow shorter and colder in the fall some birds and animals leave their summer homes and travel great distances to spend the winter
oh a butterfly how pretty that's called a monarch butterfly
look at that funny bird
oh that's a swallow
that little bird
and this is a hoopoe apparently
well some birds and animals leave their summer homes and travel great distances to spend the winter in warmer lands where there's plenty of food this is called migration
that means when it gets cold out Honey the birds fly south to the warm weather that's called migration
neat huh
mhm
preparing for winter
in the fall wherever you live you may find signs of birds and animals getting ready for the winter
many of them stock up on food before it becomes scarce and others are preparing shelters or homes to keep them warm and safe for the winter
squirrels bury nuts in the fall
any nuts that a squirrel forgets about may sprout and grow into trees
oh look at that
I'm not sure what kind of butterfly it is but it's pretty huh
yeah
there's the stars at night
these star maps will help you identify the constellations that you can see in the night sky in the winter
the best time to use the maps is at around eleven P M on a clear night away from city lights
you know Mommy and Daddy grew up in the city and we never saw any stars because there were so many lights in the city
but the stars look pretty here
and one day when you were a little tiny baby Mommy and Daddy got you up in the middle of the night and took you out to a play ground to look at the stars at night
I think there were some shooting stars or something like that
but we bundled you up and you were nice and warm
yes I can
hello
winter weather
in most parts of the winter winter is colder than other seasons
the days are shorter and the nights are longer
in countries where the temperature drops below freezing point for much of the winter there is a lot of frost and snow
and some places there may be snow on the ground for several months
hmm
this is neat this says how to make a snow shaker
yeah that's very neat
stormy skies
water colors are very good for painting moody skies and clouds
especially if you wet the paper first
before you start a picture try some of the ideas shown below to find out how to create different effects
wow
look at this you can make clouds
oh how pretty
ooh and there's a castle
and stormy stormy air
winter buds
in the winter trees hardly grow at all but slow down and rest
oh
I think it's a tree actually with a little bud
see
is that neat
all these look at all these different little sticks with things growing on them huh
let's see if we can find our tree in the back
our tree's a red oak tree
I don't see any oaks here
here's sort of
sort of like ours
yeah
let's see
that's right
look at all those beautiful green leaves
that's an oak leaf
that's like what falls from our tree
this one
that's brown and then these are green right
winter trees
trees that lose their leaves in winter are called deciduous trees
well you learn something every day huh
almost all of them have broad flat leaves
deciduous trees lose their leaves each fall and grow new ones in the following spring
do all the leaves fall to the ground and we rake them up into big piles
or Manny rakes them up for us because he's better at it than we are
winter flowers oh look at all
few plants flower in the winter because frost and ice harm them but toward the end of the winter when it starts to get warmer the first flowers appeal
look for them in sheltered spots in gardens parks and woodlands
the crocus sometimes we see little crocus flowers here
when winter is over
camellias those are pretty huh
they do look like roses they do
baked potatoes
yummy
oh those are tomatoes you are right those are tomatoes and these are potatoes
baked potatoes are one of the easiest things to cook and make a warming meal on a winter's day
below are
they are potatoes
do they look like little rocks
they do
okay this does not sound good to Mommy
below are two suggestions for different fillings
tuna and sweet corn
does that sound good to you tuna and corn in a potato
really it doesn't sound so good to Mommy
but you know maybe it's good but
it kind of looks like someone threw up
but don't let me hold you back
cheese and bacon ooh doesn't that sound good cheese and bacon on a potato
who likes bacon
that sounds good to me does it sound good to you
cheese and bacon you like bacon don't you
so this is how you bake
make a baked potato Sweetie
you wash your potato
and you poke it with a fork
and you put it in a hot oven
and then it gets all cooked and you cut it open and you can fill it with things
yummy
that's right
that's right
bird watching
it is hard for birds to find enough to eat in the winter so you can help them by putting out food and water for them in your yard or on a window ledge
this gives a good opportunity to watch them at close hand
know what we should probably do Honey
I think on our tree back there we have a bird feeder but it doesn't have any bird food in it do you think maybe this weekend we should buy some
and then we could see some really neat birds
maybe we could see a blue jay
or a cardinal
that would be neat
hmm
oh look it says here we can put bread or cheese or potato or bacon
birds like bacon too
everybody likes bacon
except for maybe a pig
surviving the winter
different animals have different ways of coping with the cold weather and lack of food in winter
some of them go to sleep all winter that's called hibernation
others have thick coats to keep them warm so they can continue looking for food throughout the winter
that's a little sleeping hedgehog
this is a marmot
it's an alpine marmot
alpine marmots seal themselves into their burrows underground and sleep for the winter
that is they sleep for half the year
six months
well that's right caterpillars will turn into butterflies right
bugs that's right sometimes they shed their skin
let's see what it says about summer and spring okay
look at the pretty paper daisies you can make
that's very pretty
yeah but this would be a pretty thing to make one day
we should make this with Phoebe I bet she would like to make these don't you think
would you like to take your Cinderella wig off Sweetie
no
looks pretty snazzy
planting seeds did we plant
we planted some things in the backyard didn't we
plant flower seeds indoors early in spring and they will flower in the summer
here you can see how to grow pansies from seeds but you can plant most other small flower seeds in the same way
you fill the little containers with soil
and you put two little seeds in each section
cover the box with newspaper and leave it outside
water every few days
that's interesting
I did not know that
after two weeks shoots will appear
that is very very interesting
hmm
how about that
soak the egg box wow you can plant them in the little egg box
I did not even know that
and put them in a big pot
is that a bad piece
you don't like the crust Honey
of the bread
no hmm
you know what I don't have any more bread those were our last two slices Mommy has to go buy some more bread
I don't have any more but I can get you something else
oh look at this from tadpole to frog
well I don't have any more toast Sweetie Pie
we hafta go to the supermarket to buy it
oh that is a beetle
that's a swimming beetle
whoops watch out for your
right
that's right
that's right
from tadpole to frog
early in the spring frogs lay their eggs which are called frog spawn
a newt
that's a newt
newt
newt
it's a newt
it's a newt
okay
frogs lay their eggs in
and those are newts
wanna hear about frogs how frogs grow
frogs lay their eggs in clumps of clear jelly which float to the surface of the pond
after about ten days
yeah that's kind of a little weird
after about ten days tadpoles wiggle out
that's what they look like it kind of looks
sort of looks like a frog but sort of looks like a fish
and they swim in search of food
the tadpoles then grow legs
and they come to the surface of the water to breathe
after twelve or thirteen weeks the tadpoles have turned into tiny frogs
wow that's neat
oh look at all these eggs that you can decorate look how pretty these are
that's right did you go did you go on an egg hunt last year
who'd
that's right with Matt and Aunt Jill hid all sorts of yummy treats didn't she in the eggs
yeah she's a good egg hunter
that's true you guys found bunnies too
you are right
oh look
that is cute
bunnies
bunny
bunny bunny bunny
look at the baby animals
the baby ducks
and what are these
little baby pigs called piglets
do you know someone named Piglet
who is he friends with
Pooh Bear that's right
oh summer
summer summer summer
what's that
butterfly that's right
spring is a good
that's a caterpillar
spring is a
mhm
caterpillar caterpillar
spring is a good time to look for caterpillars you might spot some in a garden or out in the country
many of them live on leaves but you may also find one wiggling across a path in search of its food plant
wow
he is looking at you
the tiny caterpillar eats and eats and grows bigger and bigger
and then it makes a hard case called a pupa around itself
or a cocoon
and when it comes out
well this is the little cocoon they make around themselves and when they come out of the cocoon what are they
ah a big butterfly or a moth
hmm
well this is a butterfly but a caterpillar can also turn into a moth
a moth is a moth
wow
oh yummy
that is tomatoes and mozzarella cheese with fresh basil
yes and you love cheese too so that's just delicious
we had mozzarella and tomatoes last week when Manny brought us lots of yummy tomatoes right
you want something to eat now
would you like some you want me to get you some champagne crepes
well how would you go about asking for that water
okay
put you some water in this cup for you okay
here ya go Sweets
tomato feast
sorry Honey I just coughed on you
let me hold this until you get up on the couch
can you scooch over a little
thank you very much
what do you say
you are welcome
mm homegrown vegetables taste delicious and you don't even need a garden
here you can find out how to grow tomatoes in pots
hmm interesting
maybe we should do that next year
yes tomatoes are red so delicious
yeah delicious
mm strawberries
that's yummy
hmm summer flowers oh that's very pretty
bug watch
what are those
beetles have hardened front wings that protect their delicate flying wings
look for them under bark
that's called a devil's coach horse beetle
and this is a green shield beetle
and this is a click beetle
that apparently is a cockchafer beetle
yeah and what's this
that's a dragonfly right
right
wow you are right
beetles eat all kinds of plants and animals and there are thousands of different beetles living everywhere
ants live together in enormous groups called colonies and they make nests by burrowing in sand or soil
if you watch where a line of ants goes you will probably find their nest hole
the ants work hard carrying food and other things back to the colony
they leave a scent trail between the food they find and the nest so the rest of the ants will know which way they went
bees there's a little bumble bee
bees feed on nectar a sweet liquid found inside most flowers
most bees gather nectar from one type of flower at a time
as a bee flies from flower to flower it also gathers pollen
the sticky yellow dust inside flowers
it carries the pollen to other flowers and this helps the flowers to make new seeds
that's great
okay you hold the bug page open Honey
okay
when I come back are you gonna tell me something great about bugs
you know what we may Sweetie what we may do later
we may hafta stop at the mall okay
we don't need to get beetles at the mall but we hafta get you socks you need socks at the mall
you want me to hold that you get comfy
did you learn anything exciting about bugs while I was gone
what did you learn
did you find did you learn that let's see
dragonflies fly
those are ants
dragonflies fly low above ponds and streams early in the summer
their brightly colored bodies flash as they swoop across the water chasing insects
you may see them resting on leaves their wings outstretched in the sun
butterflies and moths are attracted to brightly colored scented flowers
like bees they feed on nectar
watch how they stretch
yeah there's a butterfly
hmm
interesting
okay snail trail
snails live in damp shady places and are easy to find
that's a snail
a damp shady place that's where they like
damp is like kind of wet
mhm
let Mommy get a paper towel Sweets
here we go
better
delicious
snails slither along the ground
snail trail
snails slither along the ground leaving a trail of slime behind them
ew
slime
see here's the slime a trail of slime
the slime
yeah the slime helps them cling to things
no those are little eggs
those are little baby snails
those are baby baby snails
a snail has two pairs of tentacles
it smells with one pair and has eyes on the other
ew that is so neat huh
kind of yucky but neat too right
my goodness
that is very
oh the slime the slime
well
it's neat too
yeah
well you could touch some that's true I guess
snails usually come out to feed at night or after rain
this is because their skin is not waterproof
and they die if they dry out
oh look that's interesting
that's on top of a banana
that's the snail
and that's his shell
in the winter or hot weather snails hide in shady spots they close themselves into their shells with slime
most snails feed on plants and are especially fond of soft growing shoots
interesting very interesting
if you go to a beach you can have fun looking for shells pebbles and other treasures
it's best to explore at low tide when the sea is out
try looking along the line of seaweed that marks the high water level
at the top of the beach
I don't see any seaweed in this picture but
oh yes you are right
that is seaweed
seaweed
we saw seaweed when we went to the beach with Tamara didn't we
mhm what's this what's this
the starfish
a starfishy hmm
look at all these different types of shells
that is really neat
cone shells prickly cockle shells spider conch
cat's paw scallop
oysters
wow
mussels Welch's
that's pretty neat
hmm
beach treasures
there are lots of things you can do with the treasures you have collected from the beach
you could make
well

Graham wanted to take the turtle
he just wanted a turn to play with the turtle right

right
okay what's this book called
Franklin
rides a bike
Franklin could swim underwater and hit a home run
he knew how to climb the monkey bars and pump himself high on the swing
but Franklin had a problem he couldn't ride his bike without his training wheels
in the Spring all of Franklin's friends had training wheels on their bikes
Beaver was the brave one she took her extra wheels off first
she practiced and practiced then she went to the park to show off
look at me she shouted I can ride my bike all by myself
Franklin watched Beaver ride around in circles
it wasn't long before Beaver could signal with one paw and hold on to the handle bar with the other
soon everyone but Franklin could ride without training wheels
we are going on a picnic said Bear come on
Franklin was worried his friends would make fun of his training wheels so he fibbed and said I'm not hungry and went home to eat lunch alone
that's sad isn't it
yeah
what's wearing
a helmet and
a backpack right
right
that's so that if they fall down they don't hurt their heads right
just like when you go skating you wear your helmet right
yeah
afterwards Franklin asked his mother to help take the training wheels off his bike
he wanted to ride all by himself
he sat on his bike and his mother gave him a push
Franklin wibbled@wp and wobbled and teetered and tottered
and he fell into the
oh no
I can't do it he said I'm never riding this bike again
for the rest of the week Franklin felt left out
he watched as his friends rode off without him
they were becoming great explorers on their bikes
what are they on here
a bridge
that's Rabbit's bike
that is Bear's bike
oh oh my gosh Honey you are absolutely right
you are right
you know what the purple one must be Fox's
right oh my gosh you are good
I didn't even realize
right
you are right and the blue one's Bear's because Bear is big right
right
right
on Saturday Franklin's friends zoomed by his house
that looks like fun said Franklin's mother
I can't ride without my training wheels groaned Franklin
did you give it your best effort asked his mother
well said Franklin maybe I could try one more time
Franklin sat on his bike
it's tippy he cried
his mother held on to the seat try it I won't let you go until you tell me to
Franklin pedaled while his mother guided the bicycle from behind
he felt very unsteady and very unsure
I'm going to fall he said and stopped pedaling
riding a bicycle is difficult said his mother but you can't give up just because it's frustrating
it's too hard for me said Franklin it was easy for my friends
do you think everything comes easily for them she asked
Franklin had to think about that
Franklin went to the park he saw Beaver struggling to swing on the monkey bars
each time she got to the third rung she fell into the sand below
no Beaver said Bear do it like this it's easy
easy for you said Beaver she tried one more time and fell again
maybe tomorrow Beaver grumbled
did you go on the monkey bars at school yesterday
what did we do we went this one then the next one then the next one then the next one then we
then you fell
but I caught you right you didn't really fall
Franklin remembered when Beaver when Badger learned to swim she was afraid to put her head underwater
it's easy said Franklin just do it
Badger had spluttered and cried it took her a long time to feel good in the water
but now she could swim from one end of the pond to the other
I think she's swimming underwater
are you gonna swim underwater one day
yeah
with goggles like Phoebe wow that's going to be neat
Franklin thought about the first time Fox played baseball
he couldn't hit the ball at all
but he tried and tried until one day Fox got a home run
he's playing baseball
like Daddy's team right
well Rabbit's just hoping that Fox can hit the ball
he wants Fox to do well right
and he's waiting to catch the ball he's got his mitt on
and if Fox hits the ball Rabbit is gonna get ready to catch it
that would be great
right Rabbit's gonna catch that ball wow
just then Porcupine came by she moved very slowly
she pointed to the pads on her knees wrists and elbows
they make me feel funny she said but they keep me safe
that's it cried Franklin and he hurried home
Franklin put on
padding
he lined the walk with old pillows
I'm ready to try again he told his mother and now I won't worry if I fall
Franklin sat on his bike and his mother held on to the seat
Franklin wibbled@wp and wobbled and teetered and tottered and he fell many times but he never gave up
then it happened Franklin told his mother to let go
he didn't veer into the bushes and he didn't crash
way to go cheered his mother
Franklin was thrilled
finally he was riding his bike all by himself
I can do it he shouted
Franklin rode to the park to show his friends
look at me he called
Franklin tried to signal with one hand like Beaver but he toppled over I think I'll work on that he laughed
not everything is as easy as it looks
sure
sure do you want Frog and Toad
Thanksgiving book

at night we were nestled all snug in our beds
while visions of turkey legs danced in our heads
and the very next morning Thanksgiving yippee we got up and watched the parade on tv

relatives arrived from near and far
by taxi and airplane by train and by car
my brother came up the basement stairs lugging the kids' table and folding chairs
we counted and polished our best silverware
well you mean the little turkey
I think that's her hand
and then that's the napkin and then that's a little turkey napkin ring
right she's gonna put it down next to the plate right
yeah
we counted and polished our best silverware
and set the two tables with patience and care
the turkey went in and as more cousins came I laughed and I shouted and I called them by name

all were assembled except Uncle Norm
who called us to say he was stuck in a storm
meanwhile my mother was getting out yams
cranberry jelly and honey baked hams
when mom wasn't looking we stuck olives on fingers
and said they were puppets and grand opera singers

while dinner was cooking we played dodgeball outside
our tummies were growling can we eat yet we cried
the timer then sounded the turkey was cooked
Mom opened the oven she sniffed and she looked
when what to our watering mouths should appear
but a marvelous bird which caused us to cheer
it's a big turkey
right
its skin oh so golden the drumstick so juicy
the stuffing was fluffy thanks to Aunt Lucy
Dad slid out the bird it weighed thirty pounds
he turned and he tripped over one of our hounds
up in the air the turkey did fly
oh my gosh the turkey's flying in the air
right over the string beans
he's saying oh catch that turkey
over the string beans and straight for a pie
my brother and I made such a clatter as we leapt and caught the bird on a platter
alright said Grandpa get on with the carving
can't you see that these people are starving
Dad spoke not a word but went straight to his work
he sliced up the turkey and turned with a jerk
in front of our house we heard beeps of a horn
a trucker delivered none other than
Norm
with a wink of his eye and a twist of his head the party can start I made it Norm said
we all took our places the food smelled so great
we started to dig in but Dad said to wait
we are thankful that everyone is together this year
in our home and our hearts where we hold you so dear
that's right yummy yummy

the very next day was a leftovers feast

how about do you like Frog and Toad
oh how about this Frog and Toad
oh
okay let's see what we have here
should we start with spring
Frog ran up to the path to Toad's house
he knocked on the front door
there was no answer
Toad Toad shouted Frog wake up it's spring
said a voice from inside the house
Toad Toad cried Frog the sun is shining the snow is melting wake up
I'm not here said the voice
Frog walked into the house it was dark
all the shutters were closed
Toad where are you called Frog
go away said the voice from a corner of the room
Toad was lying in
oh my gosh
he had pulled all the covers over his head
Frog pushed Toad out of bed
pushed him out of the house and on to the front porch
Toad blinked in the bright sun
help said Toad I can't see anything
are you dripping on my arm Angel
a little lollipop drip
I do you are right
oh you are right maybe if you kiss it it will be better
thank you very much feels better already
mhm
but I can't see anything said Toad in the bright sun
don't be silly said Frog
what you see is the clear warm light of April
and it means we can begin a whole new year together Toad
think of it said Frog we'll skip through the meadows we'll run through the woods we'll swim in the river in the evenings we will sit right here on this front porch and count the stars
you can count them Frog said Toad I will be too tired I'm going back to
right
Toad went back into the house
he got into the bed and pulled the covers back up over his head again
but Toad cried Frog you'll miss all the fun
listen Frog said Toad how long have I been asleep
you've been asleep since November said Frog
well answered Toad a little more sleep will not hurt me
come back again and wake me up at half past May
good night Frog
but Toad said Frog I'll be lonely until then
Toad did not answer he had fallen asleep
Frog looked at Toad's calendar
the November page was still on top
so Frog tore off November tore off December January February March came to April
Frog tore off the April page too
then Frog ran back to Toad's bed
Toad wake up it's May now
what said Toad can it be May so soon
yes said Frog look at your calendar
Toad looked at the calendar and the May page was on top
why it is May said Toad and climbed out of bed
then he and Frog ran outside to see how the world was looking in the spring
wow
the story you sure know all the titles don't you
the story
one day in summer Frog was not feeling well
oh Frog you are looking quite green said Toad
but I always look green said Frog I'm a frog
well today you look very green even for a frog
he's a toad
and he's a frog

okay get into my bed and rest said Toad
Toad made Frog a cup of hot tea
Frog drank the tea and then he said tell me a story while I'm resting
alright said Toad
let me think of a story to tell you
Toad thought and thought
but he could not think of a story to tell Frog
I will go out on the front porch and walk up and down said Toad
perhaps that will help me to think of a story
Toad walked up and down on the porch for a long time
but he could not think of a story to tell Frog
then Toad went into the house and stood on his head
why are you standing on your head asked Frog
I hope that if I stand on my head it will help me to think of a story said Toad
Toad stood on his head for a long time
but he could not think of a story to tell Frog
then Toad poured a glass of water over his head
why are you pouring water over your head asked Frog
I hope that if I pour water over my head it will help me to think of a story said Toad
Toad poured many glasses of water over his head but he still could not think of a story
well chewing lollies is not good for your teeth
well you definitely can't chew without teeth but you have teeth but it's better to lick it instead of chew it
right because that could hurt your teeth
right
right and you know what if you lick it it lasts a lot longer than if you chewed it
it's true
yummy yummy yummy
that's one red tongue you have
then Toad began to bang his head against the wall
why are you banging your head against the wall asked Frog
I hope that if I bang my head against the wall hard enough it will help me think of a story
he has a headache
because he banged his head against the wall oh no
well he has a headache now he hurt his head
right
I'm feeling much better now Toad said Frog I don't think I need a story anymore
oh then you get out of bed and let me get in said Toad because I feel terrible
would you like me to tell you a story Toad
yes said Toad if you know one
once upon a time said Frog there were two good friends
a Frog and a
right
the frog was not feeling well and asked his friend the toad to tell him a story
but the toad couldn't think of a story
he walked up and down but he couldn't think of one
he stood on his head but he couldn't think of one
he poured water over his head but he still couldn't think of one and he banged his head against the wall but still could not think of a story
then the toad did not feel so well and the frog was feeling better
so the toad went to bed and the frog got up and told him a story
the end
how was that Toad said Frog
but Toad didn't answer he had fallen
right
do you wanna help Mommy make a cup of tea
what's this one called
the lost button
Toad and Frog went for a long walk
they walked across they walked in the woods and along the river
at last they went back to Toad's house
oh drat said Toad not only do my feet hurt but I have lost one of my
buttons
oh don't worry said Frog we'll go back to all the places where we walked and you will soon find your button
they walked back tall grass
here's your button cried Frog
oh that's not my button said Toad my button my button is white and that button is black
so Toad put the black button in his pocket
a sparrow flew down excuse me said the sparrow did you lose a button because I found one
well that's not my button said Toad that button has two holes and mine had four holes
Toad put the button in his pocket
they went back to the woods and looked on the dark path
here's your button said Frog
oh that's not my button cried Toad that button is small and my button was big
big but Toad put the small button in his pocket
who's that
a raccoon came out I heard you were looking for a button he said here's one that I found
well that's not my button wailed Toad that button is square and my button is round
but he put the square button in his pocket
the button yes I think it has holes
I think it has four holes but it's square instead of round
Frog and Toad went back to the river and looked for the button in the mud
here's your button said Frog
oh that's not my button shouted Toad that button is thin and my button was thick
Toad put the thin button in his pocket
he was very angry
he jumped up and down and screamed
our whole world is covered with buttons and not one of them is mine
Toad ran home and slammed the door
there on the floor he saw his white four holed big round thick button
oh said Toad it was here all the time
what a lot of trouble I have made for Frog
Toad took all the buttons out of his pocket and took his sewing box down from the shelf
then he sewed the buttons all over his jacket
the next day Toad gave his jacket to Frog
Frog thought it was beautiful
he put it on and jumped for joy
none of the buttons fell off
Toad had sewed them on very well
yay
oh my you are so drippy oh no

Toad and Frog
let me get a little wipe for you
oopsie

Toad and Frog went down to the river
what a day for a swim said Frog
yes said Toad I will go behind these rocks and put on my bathing suit
I don't wear a bathing suit said Frog
well I do said Toad and after I put on my bathing suit you must not look at me until I get into the water
why not asked Frog
because I look
I look funny in my bathing suit that's why
Frog closed his eyes when Toad came out from behind the rocks
Frog and Toad jumped in the water and swam all afternoon
Frog swam fast and made big splashes
Toad swam slowly and made smaller splashes
a turtle came along the riverbank
Frog tell that turtle to go away said Toad I don't want him to see me in my bathing suit
Frog swam over to the turtle
turtle you'll have to go away because Toad thinks he looks funny in his bathing suit and he doesn't want you to see him
some lizards were sitting nearby
does Toad really look funny in his bathing suit they asked
a snake crawled out of the grass
if Toad looks funny in his bathing suit I for one want to see him
we want to see him too said the dragonflies
me too said field mice
field mouse I haven't seen anything funny in a long time
Frog swam to Toad

I dripped on you
I don't have anything to drip silly girl
I did but I don't have a lolly you have a lolly
I did
oh when I was cleaning your face

yeah do you love your big girl bed
oh yes sorry
I'm sorry Toad said Frog everyone wants to see how you look
I will stay right here until they go away said Toad
the turtle and the lizards and the snake and the dragonflies and the field mouse all sat on the river bank and waited for Toad to come out of the water
oh please go away cried Frog
but no one went away
Toad was getting colder and colder
he was beginning to shiver and sneeze
I will have to get out of the water he said I'm catching
a cold
Toad climbed out of the river and the water dripped out of his bathing suit and down on to his feet
the turtle laughed the lizards laughed the snake laughed the field mouse laughed and Frog laughed
right
what are you laughing at Frog said Toad
I'm laughing because you do look funny in your bathing suit said Frog
of course I do said Toad and picked up his clothes and went home
what's this one called
oh the letter yes it's true
Toad was sitting on his front porch when Frog came along and said what's the matter Toad you look sad
yes said Toad this is my sad time of day
it's the time when I wait for the mail to come and it makes me very
very unhappy because he thinks he's get any mail right
one more chin wipe
I never get any mail said Toad
not ever asked Frog
no never said Toad
no one has ever sent me a letter
every day my mailbox is empty and that is why waiting for the mail is a sad time for me
Frog and Toad sat on the porch feeling sad together
then Frog said I have to go home now Toad there's something I must do
Frog hurried home
he found a pencil and a piece of paper
he wrote on the paper
he put the paper in an envelope and on the envelope he wrote a letter for
Toad
he ran out of his house and saw a snail that he knew
snail said Frog please take this letter to Toad's house and put it in his mailbox
sure said the snail right away
then Frog ran back to Toad's house Toad was in bed taking a nap
Toad said Frog I think you should get up and wait for the mail
no said Toad I'm tired of waiting for the mail
Toad said Frog you never know when someone may send you a letter
no I don't think anyone will ever send me a letter
Frog looked out of the window the snail was not there yet
but Toad someone might send you a letter today
don't be silly said Toad no one ever sent me a letter before and no one's going to send me a letter today
the snail was still not there
Frog why do you keep looking out of the window asked Toad

yes there will said Frog because I sent you
a letter

I wrote dear Toad I am glad you are my best friend your best friend Frog
oh said Toad that makes a very good letter
and Frog and Toad went out to the front porch to wait for the mail
