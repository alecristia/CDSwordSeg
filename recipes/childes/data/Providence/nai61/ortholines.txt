I put a new batch of laundry in
I think he's done pooping
he's done so he's just gonna sit in my lap and read
well when you put yours in the potty you can pretend you put his in too
hmm oh that must be the hospital building
that's what that is
mm what's that
where
yeah
and what's that
here's it is kind of it's a helicopter that works like an ambulance it also brings people to the hospital but brings them in the air
Gospal in the hospital
last year I was Gospal the dog walker
when our neighbors went on vacation I walked their dogs
and guess what I bought with the money they gave me
a key chain with a little
what
race car yes
what's this thing
a ramp
hmm I thought it might be Gospal's shadow
well it's it's got a little key chain with a race car attached to it
yeah
ramps don't have ears so it must be his shadow
every one at school wanted it but it was mine
I was scared that some one would steal it well I'm not dumb I knew a perfect place to hide it I put the key chain in my
mouth oh oh
what happens to him
he does
what do you think the teacher is trying to do
what blue thing
that's the bench that they are sitting on
what do you think the teacher is trying to do
because because he's sick
he swallowed something
oh dear
the teacher called an ambulance
there it is
the ambulance people put me on a stretcher they asked me what happen but I still didn't want to tell
oh see they don't know he swallowed his key chain
they just know that he's very sick
it was a little hard to explain why I put a key chain in my mouth
I hope that you never do anything like that it'll be very bad for you they took me to the hospital what do you see in the hospital here
mhm
what do you think that is
not the red thing see this white thing it's in the room
that's the special water going into patient's body
you had some special water going into your body when you were in the hospital remember
okay what happens next I had a big room all to myself
the nurse took off my scarf and put a white gown on me
don't worry she said we'll take a good care of you it wouldn't hurt
but I was still little scared specially when she took me to the x ray room
do you remember getting x rays
you might not remember you did get x rays couple of times
that's his x ray and that shows the key chain right in his belly right there
poor little guy ah
the doctors asked him to count to ten of course I said
can you count
one
two
three
I'm reading the story
I fell sleep after counting to three and dreamed I was a race car driver
they were right I didn't feel a thing when I woke up it was already night
my parents were right there and Mom gave me a great big
I think you are right
inside was a race car so big I would never be able to swallow it
that's the end of the story
again
yeah
I think you might be finished on the potty there
you do
did you do more poop in there
can I look
you just want me to read the book more but I'll read the book more after you get off the potty
oh boy
maybe we should call Daddy and see if he's coming home
well he wasn't stung by the yellow jackets and that's a good thing because he said he was allergic
why don't we give Daddy a call
you wanna take off that sticker
that's the price sticker
that's to tell people how much the book cost
you need your hair elastic fixed
well that you took off the whole sticker
that's not a sticker that's the that's printed on the book
hey do you wanna try to start ah making a new bedtime poster tonight
we could do that
yeah you took all the things off of it though so we need to make a new one that says what what we do at night time
alright one more time and then I think you done on the potty
I don't think you are peeing or pooping are you
ah all this is is the title of the book Gospal in the hospital
last summer I was Gospal the dog dog walker when our neighbors went on vacation I walked their dogs
and guess what I bought with the money they gave me
did he buy dog food
no did he buy did he buy a Chompo bar
hmm did he
did he buy a tricycle
oh a key chain with a little race car
everyone at school wanted it but it was mine
he's in school he's an animal who goes to school
I was scared that someone would steal it well I'm not dumb I knew the perfect place to hide it I put the key chain in my mouth
but gulp oh no I swallowed it
I think he did gulp it
oh my god
oh you think he chewed it
oh maybe he did he definitely swelled though
suddenly I felt very sick
he really doesn't feel well
what happened Gospal said the teacher but I didn't answer I was afraid to tell her about my key chain
I think he's may be embarrassed
well he wishes he hadn't swallowed the key chain
she called an ambulance
the ambulance put me on a stretcher
this is the stretcher
they asked me what happened but I still didn't want to tell
it was a little hard to explain why I put a key chain in my mouth
well that's a good question I don't know I guess may be he thought the other children liked it very much
they took me to the hospital oh those are the ambulance people
see there he's on the stretcher they are carrying him in
ah let see
this is the special water
it's a i v fluid
called i v fluid it's also called special water it's something that goes for some people when they are in the hospital they need to get it
that's a patient
that's the patient's bed
yes I think you are right
the people who go to the hospital usually are sick
mm
I was a little scared that's what this page says
they saw what I swallowed
well it's no fun to be in the hospital
they said you wouldn't feel a thing you'll be sleep they gonna go in and take the key chain out of his belly
I fell asleep after counting to three and dreamed I was a race car driver
they were right I didn't feel a thing when I woke up it was already night
my parents were right there what's that
it's a great big package
it could be a bath tub
do you think it's a bath tub
it could be an apple tree
do you think it's an apple tree
you are probably right
it could be ten pairs of pants
it was a race car
what a nice present from his parents that's the end of the story
and I think it's time
