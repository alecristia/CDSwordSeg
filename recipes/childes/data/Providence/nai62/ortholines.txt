I can't tell
no it's just a piece of fuzz
I don't know what that was
well it for a minute it looked like a little dragonfly but it wasn't it was just a piece of fuzz
look doesn't it a little bit
I'm trying to think of what this may have come off of
it may have come off of the raccoon
m'not sure
yeah if you feel this fuzz and then feel the black part of the raccoon's tail
they feel similar
the texture is similar
what thing
what thing
oh did you drop it
I think I gave it to you to feel
here

okay
you wanna go to your room together

why don't we buy some more things at this store
and then we'll go to the other store we'll be doing a lot of shopping today
you know you could pretend to buy the barn that we just bought at the Waldorf school store
we could buy it from miss Mahoney who we bought it from
I'm gonna go put some water on for my tea okay
the raccoon and us don't have a name
I'm gonna go put my water on I just wanted to find your backpack first
where is Naima's little
where is your little pink
oof that was loud
here it is
would you like to carry a friend around in it
would you like to take someone for a ride in it
mm
maybe Griz
no Griz is too big
how bout
well actually the raccoon would fit
raccoon
go ahead and put him in
yeah
shall I put him in
get your tail in raccoon
Naima's gonna carry you and you can look outside while you are going
maybe you could take him on a hike like the way Mommy and Daddy took
I bet he's gonna like that
you are going to Kawadee Head with him
okay lemme put this on your
just look at Mommy face Mommy I'm gonna put it on your back
this is the way you were in the backpack when you went to Kawadee Head
well I'm gonna
oh the way it is on Mommy and Daddy sometimes
okay
let me turn around let me fix him
he needs to be more upright so he can see everything
okay
let's see
oh that's perfect I think he's looking forward to hiking
I think Griz is in the kitchen sitting in a chair let's go in 'cause I wanna start my water anyway
so you are hiking at Kawadee Head do you like it here
what are the kinds of things you can see at Kawadee Head
what's Griz gonna do at Kawadee Head
well he could find bear caves in the along the trail
oh what's the matter sweet heart
oh dear
yes
oh that's great should we go get some of those rocks
let's get some of the rocks for him
Griz got some at Blueberry Hill
oh gee I'm not sure I know which ones those are
but I know where there are some rocks
hmm
I think this would be make some very nice water for Kawadee Head
you get the rocks and
did you step on a lego or something
here are the rocks
okay Griz do you like throwing them
oh where's the backpack
the raccoon got out of it
oh is that why the raccoon got out
I see
ah
oh good
let's put your backpack on because you know what you are carrying your picnic lunch in it
you are on a hike you were on a hike to Kawadee Head and you need to still carry your lunch
well let's just pretend
really
where'r you gonna push Griz to on his very fun ride
oh does Kawadee Head have a play ground
oh the play ground with a bear walk
oh I'm trying to remember which one that is
oh I know where you mean
the I know the bear walk one where we took your shoes off
that was the Machias play ground
school play ground at Machias
yes we took your shoes off and it was a bear walk and it went up too
it was like bear walking up a hill
that was in Lubec that play ground
okay
meanwhile he's gonna find the doll
oh boy does he know that or is it going to be a surprise
oh Griz you are in for some fun that's such a great play ground
the main where we heard the hurdy gurdy
that was in Lubeck also
that was at a little shop a little actually a little art gallery and there was a hurdy gurdy man and a hurdy gurdy woman playing hurdy gurdies
nice musical instrument
you think Griz would like to listen to that music
great
oh
I'm going to come back and listen after I make my tea I hear the water boiling
mm
the raccoon plays the hurdy gurdy
wow
I can't wait to hear it I'm gonna come listen in just a minute
Naima we might go in a little while and bring shoes back to her
well I think we will
I'm not sure if we are gonna see her though that's the only thing
'cause she went somewhere to visit her cousins today
and I don't know if she'll be back
by the time we go
I think we'll go in about a half an hour
go and bring her shoes back
'cause I'm
because I'm sure she'll want her shoes
well they are her new shoes I don't think she's even worn them very much
she went out in the boots that you borrowed
I mean that you gave her
those are her boots now
'cause they were too small for you you've got
you've got bigger feet than she has
oh they are not very small but they are smaller than yours and they just fit those boots perfectly
would you like a raisin
mm
okay let's go hear that hurdy gurdy playing raccoon
I can't wait to hear it
I'm listening
oh my goodness
my clog is the hurdy gurdy
that's a beautiful black hurdy gurdy you've got there raccoon
are you turning the handle raccoon
do you remember the hurdy gurdies had handles that you turn
Griz is going to swim in the water
let's see how he swims
mm
are you gonna show him or does he already know
really
wow
woo look at you go
you guys are swimming together aren't you
I can just barely hear it
what does it sound like
you mean it sounds like the church bells
it was barely what ing
the red bell
on the floor right there
you mean your little bells
right there
next to the yellow chair on the floor the lego chair
near the helicopter yep
oh you are playing faith and our fathers on that
on the bell
he's scared of them
are you going to comfort him
no
you are gonna let him be scared
what did he swallow
hmm
did he swallow a shoe
he did
oh my gosh
that poor bear
oh
oh
what should we do
oh it was dark outside
oh and then is he having the snack of blueberries when he's home
blueberries in the car I bet that makes a big mess
you think so
the big vacuum cleaner not even the Dust Buster
you need to use the regular vacuum cleaner
to vacuum out the mess in the car
oh he must be a very little bear to make such a big mess
only little kids make really big messes
'cause big kids know how to be a little neater and clean up after themselves and they big kids don't drop their blueberries all over the place
because they know that it's good to put them right in your mouth
guhmuh what does that mean
he was
ooh y'alright
looks like you did fall Betsy
I don't know maybe you weren't watching where you were going
is that right
are you gonna fall asleep right during supper again
