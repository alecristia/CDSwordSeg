what do you want for breakfast
is it dark outside
do we want to go outside
where is it
where
are you going to change your diaper
what's on the pictures
do you want your coat on
Tisha's watching you
she can't have the book
what's your name
don't let her pull your hair
what's Tisha doing
what was Tisha doing
the dog was in the back yard
was Mummy mad
where did the dog go Marjorie
put it down
yes
what do you like to watch on tv

where is it dark
what's heavy

what are you going to draw
matches
what did Daddy do
the kids are fine its you I'm worried about
what you been doing
where does the fork go

what else have you done

what shall we do
what's the boy doing
do you like Sesame Street
what did the man do
what's he doing
who is that
is he a monster
why is Ernie crying
what do you want Daddy to do
where's the sun
where has he gone
what toy do you like to play with
what's that
where did you wear it
what else did you wear on your head
