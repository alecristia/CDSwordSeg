the blocks
yeah
well cause that really got her she was the most
does she have any at home
not like this
she s got
actually I was gonna ask you where you got em she
but these are more fun to knock down
hum
do you have any routines you play a lot with her
she seems to play a lot of hiding routines
yeah on the changing table I do put a diaper over her face and
d you do it with blocks also
I ve never done it with blocks before
I ve never really been right in front of her and had blocks
usually y know if we re in this situation we re
when you took the doll and the dog with her you tried to get
yeah like combing the dog and stuff
yeah does she do things like that
yeah
we ve got a dog with a brush and yeah
and she combs her own hair
Loren has a couple of brushes and yeah
she s she s combed our dog before
oh I mean watched me and then y know had it in her hand but
she s also got some telephone routines
oh yeah
she s got a telephone
yeah and ours has a dial and I make it ring and she picks it
Hello
and we usually pretend it s Daddy
he calls sometimes at home
we call him
yeah You want this
you call her attention to things like
look at the boy look at the girl
Do you think she knows the difference when you say words like that
no That picture no no she might relate better to baby
a lot of times I call things baby or We have a
we call him baby bunny mommy bunny sometimes too but I
no and I do nt think these would probably be
but since these were side by side did nt hurt to
what re you doing
she likes to put things the putting in and taking out we
she likes to put them away
her books right now
I do nt know why she did nt really respond to
or just the plain blocks like that but s characters doing
she s really into books
she will bring books wherever you are in the house
she ll go into her room and bring books out and she backs up to
I realize that the whole first half I was really directing
I think that s that happens a lot at home too
I did nt think she was saying very much but
before when you had I think it was butterfly the next
is that the way she the way she handles it
so far yeah
yeah it was ants I think the second time
does she know that they are
has she ever seen
an ant
a bug whatever
yeah yeah we have in the yard we point at them and stomp
they are carpenter ants
big ants
now can she name them can she say bug
oh yeah
and does she do it appropriately
yeah
yeah
because we've seen butterflies out in the yard we call that
this time she named duck again
well she was saying duck and then she started consistently
I didn't care
right
and you are not gonna quibble over things like that
no because not now not at this point
I think a little bit later on I mean if if it had
now you did this time call attention to boys and girls
do you do that with her now in the real world
does she know the difference
I don't think she knows the difference
she doesn't attempt to say boy and girl
well she was saying boy she said boy at one point in this
she doesn't say girl
you say good girl but she doesn't
she doesn't respond
now this time you used a bunch of parts of the body with her
I thought it was interesting
she's definitely got you used the word hand with her a lot
oh well I never even thought of naming that
she knows that so well but we started with well the face
and she knows
oh the tongue and the teeth and the mouth and the nose and
do you play any games with her like stick out your tongue
Alice where's your tongue
where's stick it out
stick it right out
go
now she knows how to say shoes
and socks
does she know shoes from other things like sneakers and sandals
they are all shoes
they are all shoes to her
she knows socks
in the food book she pointed to she says juice
and then you sort of pointed out the other things that went with
things like drinking out of the cup
does she know those words because you named them and she didn't
she doesn't use a bib so she doesn't know that word at all
and we don't say cup she doesn't use a cup she uses either a
and soup
does she eat soup with a spoon
cereal and soup yeah
do you play kissing games with her
we kiss a lot
and we ask her for kisses a lot and she kisses her sister a
at one point
but so the smelling the book let's see we had a couple a
now because of the puppy she's into biting so she's learned a
well the puppy bites her
I tell her to tell me whenever the puppy bites and then we whack
does she play with the blocks now
oh yeah we got some cloth covered blocks like this that we
big new word is apple right
yes yeah
she always recognizes an apple
and she learned to say the word chair you were disappointed that
does she have her own little chair
well she climbs on everybody else's
no she doesn't
well yeah she has some
she has a set of chairs but it's really Lauren Lauren's set
is that a recent word
yeah I was surprised
about a week and a half ago she started saying chair and I
and she knows the word for key
yeah
and I don't know where that came from
does she play with yours
well occasionally
about a couple of weeks ago she had my keys where's Groucho
she can say Groucho and Chico
we've got these two cats that live in our house and she says
well a lit occasionally she does she'll reach for
that's when I noticed that she could say it
and so I give them to her if she can say it
she can have it
she had trouble with the word ball
well she she says that a lot
is it perhaps because other words are now sounding like that
and you can't figure out what word she means
yeah
she used to say ball
well she calls balloons balls
and when she saw that she said ball right away
but she said it very clearly the way she used to say it
she's got some long sentences now
she has mommy see and of course all gone but that's not
daddy bye is daddy gone
or sister
and she says something else that I thought is a really long
it has about three words in it
no
I don't
no Yeah well it's there is a difference in in
yeah I like to do that I don't I don't think she knows
she knows bird she knows a rooster she knows a cow a
she's never seen butterflies either She looks at them a
she she really likes books
she what she does mostly is look at them
and either you can ask her to show you what the different
probably more often is sit there and point to the picture
and have you tell her what it is
yeah most of the time
she usually she usually looks for what she wants
I use em both
a lot
sometimes I call them bunny rabbits y know I just do use
no
I don't think I every really thought about it
yeah I do I guess
I don't I never really thought about it much
I I talk to them a lot I think probably and I usually
on her self she knows she knows all the face parts she
yeah just playing but she does
she does zippers
she likes zippers
she's always been kinda fascinated with zippers She doesn't do
she doesn't do snaps or button or anything
up and down which way
oh I think she knows when she is somewhere if I say to her
do you want to get down
that it means out of where she is
down from where she is I guess she does know that
I think she does I don't really think she knows asleep as
and there's a cat in here that was asleep and
and she knows when yeah when your eyes are open it means
yeah different from these but she does have some
she stacks them some but mostly what she does is put them in
and knock them over
we'll I think dragons are a pretty distinct thing
y know I mean it's like saying it's a horse or a cow
that's what it was
well if it's a dragon it's a dragon y know
I think adults probably associate bad things with dragons but
yeah
yeah I point out a lot of things to her y know we are
I've even tried making a distinction between pigeons and other kinds
yeah yeah she's probably not as specific Well
yeah she does
yeah well she just she kinda picks it up and she
The other day I was on the phone and she was sitting in the
like she was talking to somebody on the phone
a lot of times she picks up the phone and then yells for me
yeah yeah she really likes playing peekaboo
she likes putting things over her face and disappearing
are you brushing my hair
are you brushing my hair
No
I I think they probably understand maybe the same amount
y know she kinda sits there like she's talking to you sometimes
doesn't really do that
she does once in a while but not like Amelia does
no I've been reading to them a little bit but they don't pay
that's that's about all she does
she she does that and she points or she brings me somewhere
otherwise she doesn't I don't think have any
yeah the same way
are there some of these books that are better for her stage than
are there words in some of these books that are more familiar than
well she knows baby and flower
and ducks
and birds
and she's easy to pick she can pick those out pretty easily
she was also looking at the truck and dog and screws and sneakers
house and owl does she understand any of these words
yes probably everything but the mouse and the owl
does she tend to say those words at home
she tries to say boat
we have a boat
so she's familiar with that
she she does say dog I guess
yeah she does say dog
we have a dog also so
would you like a cat
do you know anyone who would like one
no
my mother's trying to get rid of some cats
she's always saying dam wan or du dat
is that supposed to be
what's that
I don't know
well I thought maybe she was she was saying
another one
because I was saying that to her
y know and I think that's something I probably say to her a lot
and she was doing that pointing to the same thing
I think she has another expression for “what's that” that sounds
what's that
yeah she's always asking what things are
you know in new books or anything she always wants she
you indicated that she was going to like one of those books because
well they don't have any books with paper pages and they like
and things they like to rip up things with paper pages
has she gotten to the point where she can manipulate
she appeared to be having some difficulty with the clothing on the
she can take her clothes off
y know she can't put her anything on
but she she she does try to put things on
she was interested in the sneakers
yeah
they have new sneakers
and she tried to untie
yeah she unties her shoes and takes them off
and then she comes running to you and wants them back on again
no she usually doesn't want them back on again
wha d yo want
this
she really got into the word flower
yeah she's been saying flower for a long time
wha do you want this
it's not a baby it's a boy
looks like a baby to you I guess
another baby
she's very interested in putting the dog in and out of the house
is she into putting doll furniture into houses or anything like
no
she really wanted to open and shut that door so much
does she do that much at home
no she doesn't
does she understand the terms house and door
well I don't know
she knows what house and door are at home but I don't know if
or a door
she was pointing to the words on the paper
yeah I usually point out
words numbers that's probably why she was pointing them out
does she understand the word
words
no she doesn't
but she does pay selective attention to them
I think that she knows that they are different than pictures
she was really into the textures in this book here the way you
no
but this book rips apart
has she got any new routines that she didn't have the last time we
I don't know
I can't think of anything really
today she had many more words or things that sounded closer to
does she attempt to use them with
does she talk to
she talks to but never sounds like she's saying anything to
they kind of babble back and forth to each other
and at this point you would say that Amelia has a vocabulary of
I don't know
maybe six seven words one two probably has two
yeah says Grover and
she has words now doesn't she
oh yeah she does
she spent a lot of time talking about the dog
and she especially mentioned the house
she has the word house right
does she know it for real houses and play houses does she use it
well she knows real houses she doesn't really have
well well Kristin does Kristin has a doll house that she
and she says what
hau
oh I don't know it
and she knows the door and everything
she wanted something to get out or something and she said
take it out
or
it out
or something
she says she says a lot of things like that that sound like
y know like she says something like
I wanna walk
and the only thing you can really understand is the walk part
she wouldn't play with the phone
no
well there was nobody talking to her
that's interesting because many kids prefer toy phones to real
she doesn't have a toy phone anymore
she used to but she doesn't any more
and she's only had contact with a real phone recently
does she talk on it
she listens She doesn't talk much she listens more
that's the dog's
it's funny because she said No when she picked it up
is that because there was no one there
that disturbs her apparently
well it didn't do anything I guess for her
she's very good at grooming the dog Does she play at grooming
no
she just she brushes her own hair but she doesn't she
she's really good at looking for the parts of the animal
she was good at identifying the eyes although she got confused
the nose it looked just like the eyes
and she knew where to look for the mouth
and was disturbed when it wasn't there
and I think I was really surprised when you said
Where's the tail
she went and looked right away
we have a dog
so I think that's probably why
ya wanna go in there
does she play with the dog's tail
yes
she hangs onto the dog's tail and lets the dog pull her around the
she puts the dog in the house but you don't have a doghouse for
no
now with the dragon She seemed afraid of the dragon but
I think she was afraid of it because it moved
huh but after she put her own hand in it
yeah then it was okay
does she have puppets at home
no
so it's new for her to put her hand in and make something move
they have had a puppet I can't I can't remember
recently they go outside a lot they play with cards
y know they like things that do things
the book that pleased her the most apparently was were the two
does she seem to prefer those kinds of books
yeah that's mostly what she's got at home
although she now likes to look at magazines She likes to
and kids
how did you get that out
that's the first time anyone got that out
I did it The first time I could get it out though
of the books though does she seem to prefer
the books she has are very simple
probably because I prefer those kind of books
not you look at books that have a cluttering of things on the
she was good at turning the pages when you asked her to
does she do that by herself
hum
so she'll sit there and just flip through
yeah
she doesn't need help
no
I marked down here that you were supplying the words for some
no she's usually very good about it I don't know maybe
she picks out cats very well
she didn't name the boy and the girl
she pointed to them but she didn't name them
no
she calls them kids
a lot of times
do you want this in
I just had it in and there you wanted it out
she did notice the dogs that she had a word for
she calls the dog her name
she knows the word chair
a couple of kids her age have recently been fixated by chairs
yes she does
does she have her own
no just her high chair
you don't want this
alright why don't you go put it away
can you go do that for me
she obviously doesn't like help getting in and out of
no
now with the crayons she didn't say crayons but she knew what
does she play with them
yeah
she does
she scribbles with them
and she knows that they are for writing do you think that was what
yeah she was saying write that was what she was saying
with a lot of things you were giving functions so that with the
no I think she understands
and she uses a cup so she knows what it's for
yeah she knows
I think she understands those
just pull it out it'll come out
another word that she had and I wonder if it was from the summer
she likes holes
now with the blocks
she used to just carry them around in a bowl what does she do now
oh yeah she likes to stack them she likes to knock them
so she's not just carrying them from place to place
no
she's trying to build with them
hum
the last thing
she was noticing the cow and the bird and then she had trouble
and again you said the bird is to fly
she knows birds fly
she says that a lot
birds fly
cause we feed the birds and then she watches them fly away
you are gonna put the brush in there
she was real good at knowing all the names on the dapper Dan
she calls all fat we have several Hupty Dumpty's and she
I noticed I noticed there's an several other play areas
I don't know why
it's a familiar familiar character I guess
she seemed to know the difference between buttons and snaps
yeah she knows buttons n snaps
she can't do them
she can't do them but she knows when we do them
she can't motor do them
but she recognizes the difference between all of them
I think so
snaps is odd except that all baby t shirts have
you'd think that zippers would be easier to manipulate
no they are not
they are two handed
I mean you have to hold one and pull with the other
who are you calling really
you never call mommy
who are ya callin
hello
we don't have this kind of telephone yeah they are all dials
that's a nice one isn't it
hello
hello
ding ding ding stop playing with the phone
put the phone back
hello
this makes a sound
yeah usually we call daddy
is daddy there
but she uses the real phone she'll talk to him on the phone
byebye
can ya put it back
she calls the dog puppy
do you have a dog at home
no
my sister my sister lives in the same house with us
daddy home
no he went to work
does she use doggie and puppy interchangeably
yeah and puppy dogs no difference same word
I was noticing in fact thinking about this yesterday quite a
so she seems to make a distinction on the size
but not with dogs
she thought the dragon was a birdie
yeah
originally
except that we have a book that has a dragon in it
so she knows a dragon
y know that's why I was a little surprised frankly
I frankly was surprised that she didn't know that that was a dragon
she has a lot of out and in and up and down sort of words
this is a nice toy I've never seen this one before
she hasn't been to a zoo yet so she doesn't understand what those
she's tried puppets at home she's a little afraid of it though
but she knows she knows what puppets we have
she's also watching the muppets on television my husband
she seems to know the difference between toy and not toy
I hope
yeah I hope she does
because stereos and televisions oh aren't toys
so she doesn't play with them although she does play with them
this is Nan's this is Nan's it's not Annie's and it's not a
right
she thought that the cow was a puppy
yeah a lot of things are horses words animals that she's
has she ever seen a cow
no but we have a yeah she's seen lots of pictures of cows
let's get down alright
let's get down
you didn't even see this bunny
what's that
mousie it's not a mousie it's a bunny
I'm reminded of a handicapped C P girl that I worked with for
and she said the words that were appropriate to her
and I think that's what happens with a kid
that's why the mother can can interpret what she's saying
my husband hates cats and every time he sees one he goes
rat
it's obviously working but I think it's getting her a bit
are there toys that seem to make her talk more
obviously the books make her talk less
do you use books for that activity
yeah yeah we have lots of books she doesn't use books at
it's usually at a quieter y know when I'm trying to get
but it's hard for someone her age to sit anyway
she doesn't under stand that concept
does she really understand the concept of counting
to three at least she only skips five so number
did she learn to count herself or is it something you
she started the routine cause I haven't been doing any
I think she really start counting because in the gym we she
they all do that
is it the gym class that's taught her words like “turn around”
on my knees
I don't think so
I don't think so
they just have that one routine
where does she get words like “on my lap” and “turn around” an
the other side
well “on my lap” I guess because we have a baby next store so
because she speaks in a high voice to a baby
and she speaks I mean I don't remember speaking in a high
and she goes through that whole routine with the baby thing
and we we were really amused
I think the word lap because the baby always sits on the mother's
does she do a lot of that
other side
turn around
stuff that's very sophisticated
I don't know
see I don't I don't think that we teach her anything
but you know except by what we say
she's in day care right
no no
she wouldn't accept the boy sitting just any old way
on his knees yeah
she was much more sophisticated about the little boy doll for
yeah instead of Humpty Dumpty
Yeah she really does know
if that had been a girl doll
yes by hair
not by any sex parts although she knows there's a big difference
with the blocks she used the boy as an agent Does she use
she uses me to do things for her usually
it's usually Mommy do it and I have to urge her to do it so
she still used me
does she have blocks at home that she plays with
smaller ones
just started to play with blocks
she's not that
she had some sophisticated ideas about what to do with them she
I initiated the bridge concept and she still doesn't do that
but won't make a bridge herself
she'll make a tower she knows what a bridge is like she
so she knows the concept of a bridge but she's not I don't
no I'm not done yet
she wanted to take pants off and zipper and change diapers
does she try to do that with her dolls
no
I don't like that toy
we have we just have baby dolls
does she do any of that stuff on her own clothing
yes
and Michael's
she wants to zip and unzip my pants and my belt
she doesn't have a lot y know she doesn't have belts
shoelaces and
yeah she's trying to do shoes now
but she can't do them yet
she can't tie obviously but can she untie
she doesn't try to untie
she knew every picture in the book
yeah
easily
I was amazed
there are pictures in that book I have a hard time with
she doesn't have that book at home so its that she understands
she's very good interaction wise with you
things like
it's Annie's turn
the boy's turn
he do it now
Now has become a big word
she gets on the phone and says
Daddy come home now
yeah well we are trying to share now because she has
she's entered that stage when everthing is
mine
when she says
Annie's turn
does she really
yeah
yes
but she would never say it's Mike's turn
but she said it was Mommy's turn
yeah well she likes to play with me
she also used comparatives
sit down like Annie
yeah
yeah a lot of
like me
like Annie does
like she wants to be like someone else is
if someone's bigger
so like
mommy does
again again again again
she likes to really repeat like songs I mean we'll sing
and she asks for help now
right
does she help other kids
a very small baby like she'll help Peter my nephew's
but no one her own size she's really not sharing very
I don't think
she was very into opening it and closing it Is she into
yes
yes and turns everything on and it's getting difficult
does she then put it back
that's one of the phrases that she talks about
well we try
Yes
she'll put one thing back
she likes things in their place
if its something like a coat she always insists that I hang it up
but when it's all her toys all over the floor she's not the
she had other interesting concepts
at one point she said to you
this is too heavy
you were taken aback by that one
where do you think she grabs terms like that
well because lots of times I'll tell her that something
for instance we've been putting in a garden
I'll tell her that the wheelbarrow is too heavy for her
but she insists on trying it anyway
proving to herself that she can't carry groceries in the house
she remembered the dragon
you know I I almost mentioned it to her this morning and
so I was surprised
does she have boy dolls and girl dolls at home
I don't know what she thinks some of them are
I I mean most of them are neuter
except the obvious little girl dolls
well the Humpty Dumpty's I think she considers as boys
what's the date today
she'll be twenty months tomorrow
that big sound after the elephant is my husband makes a huge sound
I was afraid to hold her off because we are going away on Friday
she calls people up
does she have any special routines
it's always hello the person's name and then oftentimes she
I mean she gets a response
do you think she talks more on the real or the play phone
no on the fake
or on the real one when there's no one on the other end
does she have particular people that she picks to
call
yeah her father and then Mark and Christopher who
always
she wanted to put the dragon in the high chair
the dragon
oh
She puts everything up in do You mean in human
everything goes every place
but she'll try to make the toys do human things
oh yes
always
she usually reads to the toys
the toys don't usually take can't usually do anything that's
can you put everything into the box for us
she thought the spoon was a kite
no the steam coming out of the the steam coming out of the
the kite tail
then you told her it was steam and that meant it was hot does she
she knows about steam because we she oftentimes will in
but I'm not sure she's ever seen steam in a book
because lots of times things are too hot and the stock phrase
I'm going to separate this with my spoon to let the steam out
is the phrase
so she knows what steam is
you were pointing out a lot of trucks to her
we've seen all of them
but she doesn't use the words for them
she only knows fire engine and truck
the dump truck she knows
but not a crane
she's not especially interested
Yeah a lot of kids do but she doesn't seem to be very
and she was confused about the snowman
cow's on the next page
I don't know
I'm surprised she doesn't know snowman but I guess she doesn't
I know for a fact that when my brother in law babysat for her
so I was a little surprised she didn't know what that was
I think sometimes she has trouble it used to be she knew
now it seems like if she's seen it in real life she has a
I don't think she's ever seen a snowman a real snowman I
she wanted the boy to sit on her lap wanted to sit on the boy's
she's back into sitting on laps
it's just a routine
she's kind of regressing I don't know what you call it
she I think she's going through a stage although I don't
I don't know anything about stages in children yet
but she's getting quite difficult to separate from me
the lunch box her nephew got a lunch box
and we keep telling her that when she goes to school she can have
She's quite she loved that lunch box
she's been a couple of times to try her out
she understood that Marco was going on some sort of vacation
yeah she understands them
talked about them before I was hoping that she would talk about
also I wanted her to get used to the fact that she's not going to
cause she really is attached to this Marco beyond belief
yeah a cousin who abuses her terribly
she understands going on a boat I think she understands fishing
she has had a fishing pole and
well she's had someone else's fishing pole they play on the
Play in the waves you know
make castles in the sand all the things that children do
is she into building
she tried to build with blocks
not a lot
she builds with blocks but
not creatively
mostly it's
what would you say is creative
she doesn't make bridges she stacks
you asked her at one point how many blocks there were
she's not counting much these days
although she was the last time she was here I remember She
does she ask
how many
that's something you do with her
no I don't think she asks how many usually
oh she'll pretend sometimes to be counting if there's a bunch
and she'll always go by rote one two three four five six
but I don't think she's connecting them
she was having some trouble with the buttons
yeah she's
what did you tell her
slide it through the hole
does that seem to help her when you give verbal instructions
usually
but I was showing her as well
and then she was doing the zipper that she remembered the name of
she wanted to well she wanted to undress him and she zipped
at one point she called the doll Marco and you said Oh is
does she name her dolls
yes
they have some names
some of them have names
one is dolly
that's the dolls' name Dolly I figured and one is
because it's Raggedy Ann
and then you talked about going to the doctor and she said
is he going to fix my thumb
she had a thumb operation
she wanted to know if he was going to fix Peter's thumb
now she thinks that everyone who goes to the doctor she had an
now she thinks that everyone who's going to the doctor is going to
she must think people have strange thumbs
she wasn't very interested in the vocabulary book
yeah she wasn't
I'm surprised
I I think she's not paying much attention today
but I'm not going to make excuses sometimes she does and
she's not super she doesn't sit and listen to books as much
the only thing she pointed out spontaneously I think was the
you mean my asking
what is that
what was the discussion about something sitting on the turtle
sure
she went to the dentist a couple of weeks ago with us and you
it's kind of like a symbiotic relationship
we have a book called crocodile tears which she's always enjoyed
it didn't crack her up
but it cracked me up because it looked like looked like you
of course the turtle doesn't have any teeth
yes all the time
well she's just she's into books into reading a lot
so what do I do when I go through the books and we've read through
she's very familiar
she will actually point
Uh I started it out just asking her where is the bird where is
and she'll point out at them and now she will actually say and
it's all Walt Disney characters and Walt Disney books and
so its that's basically what we've been going through and
she loves colors she knows green and blue
you know blue
ya know what color's yellow
can you find me something yellow
she can say yellow
lalas and lolly is yellow
red she can say but she says a weird word
sounds something like shabby For red I'm not sure why
yeah right I think it has something to do with strawberries
but pink she's really good with pink and green
they are perfectly good she can
yes black
wow
she has some soft ones that we really don't play with
they are folded
I think you saw them they are kind of made of cotton
they are really nice material
they have Winnie the Pooh with them and Micky Mouse and Donald Duck
yes you like stacking these don't cha
are they all there
sure
she can throw them they are great
she can stack them and knock them over and they don't hurt anything
She has the little round plastic and little square plastic
an they are really
that's where we really got into colors because they are such
and she's starting stacking those up the little things around
and every time I walk into a room I see another
right we have a cat and a dog so she's familiar with both
she feeds the dog all the time
from her chair when she's eating
and she's getting into combing everthing
we hide her brush and everything in the crib and a
no we call Scooby is she calls Scooby “Boo Boo” now
she started calling I'm Booby
yes right that's Scooby
and Gus is Gus Obi is another cat
she Obi's our Grandma's cat
that's Grandma
Pata is grandma
strange
no it's probably just just
you start putting the i e on it because it begins to be an
so that's how I started doing it
she dog
Puppies and dogs and she started calling them woowoo
It's terrible you pick up the kids' language
no
not at all
she has no idea what a dragon is
oh
cause it was a dragon
d ya know where your nose is
show us your nose
show us your nose Cindy
be smart
she's aware of her nose and her knees her toes
we started doing we we are doing the hokey pokey at
she says put your hand on your head put your hands on your hair
she'll she knows hair and hat and hand and ears
yeah she knew those
I haven't used those for a while
I stopped doing that
those are the things I had done a couple o months ago with
it's okay to do it with her she asked you to
she has her own little phone an all she says is hi and bye
when we call up someone she'll pick her phone up while we are on
hi and bye is it
no not really
she's talked to him on the phone actually when he's in New York
and she well she doesn't talk to him
she just listens and she knew it was him
and she would say
Daddy Daddy
afterwards and point at the phone and
daddy's doing tape recordings now too and she we've got him on
Daddy Daddy
so that she makes all these good connections
so I'm sure she knew it was his voice on the phone and she's
she doesn't say anything to him except bye maybe at the end of it
cats and dogs and mice
ducks
birds
elephants
Dumbo All of animals Oh yes
we have a little selection these little plastic pigs and cows
she can say Moo for cow I have to take her to Drummond
for that sort of thing
peter Magic cause he has all these little magic things on him
so I called him Peter
she could untie the laces
I she doesn't take any y know interest in untying
yeah she doesn't do that she has a zipper on a little case
she really has no desire to open it
no either one
yeah
she does
she knows the difference between little boys and little girls
cause she starts saying baby about everybody
I there were the kids who were at the age where their mommys
so I started saying
little boy little girl
yes
we have the tulips growing outside and she helped me pick one the
the daffodils just came out and the roses are starting to grow
it's the bush she can't touch
so luckily we live around those things
and rose and tulip it's a yeah I think I think she
I I really do
it's a pretty bright green phone
lion in the cage in the Dumbo book but it's nothing that
she uses flair pens and
she can draw circles now
it's really great I can't believe it
she's drawing all over everything though
no I had I gave her crayons but she eats them so
and it works out much better
yeah with the flairs and with the ink pens and pencils she'll
I haven't given her the crayons lately maybe I should try
but she loves to draw
we've got lots of colors that she knows
she knows all her colors
yes
just just like we did before but now instead of having to
it's great
seems to come through
what were the first colors she learned
pink
and green were the very first colors and orange seemed to come
red was the hardest
but red she can say now
I think she just had difficulty saying it
and white didn't seem to be that hard to understand and black
nothing is black when you ask for colors usually
the only things she wanted to do with the Peter magic doll were
she zips bags up and down she has her little bags
just a sec I'll give it to ya
there ya go grapes
now you can go play with the books okay
go look through those books
they are new
we haven't seen those books before
we have a ton of books at home and she can tell me exactly
hand hand
that's her favorite
does she have any of these books at home
no no none of these
in the alphabet book there were some words in there that were
do you have a sense that there were some words she could really
yeah that book especially
we have a doctor Seuss's abc book and they they ya just
this it does it's a little over the heads I think
what words especially were in it that she
well words like vanilla ice cream I'm I'm not sure
I thought that was a good word because it's not in our book
our book has something like jelly jars and jam and she's
except she knows what jelly is
but
on the other hand one of the books on meals had lots of sinple
yeah and she's pretty good about yelling for it
bib
bib
gimme that bib
I try to not have her wear it lately because she's been eating
she talks about drinking the milk up out of the cup does she
yeah she does she has a little blue cup
an ya drink you juice out of it too
there was a routine on feeding something to the dog
does she feed the dog
she feeds the dog all the time
everything she's not supposed to
her meal
she'll feed the dog she'll pick out all the good stuff
here Scoob have some good stuff
you said to her at one point who do you see in the mirror
have you practiced that
that's hard for many of the children to do
she plays with mirrors all the time
just I always did when I was a little kid and I remember my
besides herself
do you think you help her by asking
who do you see
oh yeah well first of all when you look in a mirror
there's Cindy
or
look at Cindy
so she could see how dirty her face was or wasn't so I could wash
and she would be more pleased if it were dirty to let me wash
so that's worked out very well
there were a lot of words about the garden and that happened
we have strawberries in our garden
she's very aware of those cause they are growing the
go stack your blocks
pick all the blocks up
has she started to work more with her own shoes
well shoes yes
she tries to put them on and she tries to put her clothes on
but she helps me when when I'm undressing her like
she's always very good when you dress her
ya tell her to put her arms through the holes and she will do that
and she's gotten her left leg because the doctor says always
left leg
she likes the phone
does she play with the phone now she was last time
yeah well her daddy's talked t her
he's been back and forth in New York with his band so he calls
an she talks to him it's really cute
will she actually talk on the phone
she'll tell him what she's done in two or three words like if
she went to the ocean she told him ocean
t so funny
what did she see there
what did she like
what'd you see at the ocean
I mean at the aquarium
fish
did you see shark
big shark
really neat
do you think she knows that they are fish
yeah she did appreciate them as fish
she knew they were fish and we saw the movie which was
and that kinda gives you an even better perspective cause
and the sharks were there
since they redid it I hadn't been there for a long time you can
you saw the sharks didn't ya
she didn't enjoy the book on trucks very much you said this
she remembered when it snowed and she had a snowman book I
we'd always go out and make a point of it when it did
in one of the books there were lots of things she knew
are those things she has had experience with or have you made a
no she's just those are things that she's had experience
is she fascinated with keys
she doesn't really play with my keys very much
she knows what they are I don't think she really cares that
she was very much into playing with balls last time
balls yes
balls are great
in a couple of the books you pointed out yarn
does she know what yarn is
I have yarn but it's in balls so that's why I said
balls of yarn
when I talk to her about it
she always points to it she knows kittens play with it she knows
and she knows her eggs because she probably eats them every day
she loves eggs
don't cha
and she's very much taken with ducks these days
loves ducks
does she have any other favorite animals
favorite animals dog
how bout an apple
would you like an apple
ya want out of that chair
alright you can eat applie
you can get it go head
no not at all
nother two months
see where she's at
okay sure
she's really into the books now
is that true generally
she has tons of books
Walt Disney books every story and she just loves to read all
we have the cat in the hat she'll repeat in the cat in the hat all
I don't remember
she's incredible
she seems to have a good memory for this sort of stuff
she has an incredible memory
does she have any favorite ones
well the cat in the hat the rhyming books she
mom came in
would you please go now
was one then she liked that really well and then it just got
she loves Mickey mouse books happy birthday book that's the
when's her birthday
September ninth
she was two a couple o weeks ago
some of the books were just names of things books
she seems to have acquired quite a large vocabulary although I
no not really
she's very aware
you are getting very specific with her now she's talking about
what are things for
what is the cup for what are the keys for
what type of chair is that
do you deliberately try to build up vocabulary that way
I just have we just she just wants to learn
so much it's just so why say the same thing
so does she get things like keys are to drive from you or does
she picks up some things on her own some times she knows well
they keys she says
mommy's keys
or
daddy's keys
and basically mine open the house and daddy's drive the car
you know he has more on his key chain
but she makes some up where they go but she's got a bit
this time unlike last time instead of calling the kitties
cat
oh
she's getting older
she still calls it a kitty or kI di
have you decided she's too old for words like that
no I the cats are growing up the kitten that grandma had
he was kitty
I think kitty was easier to say for her as a beginner but i e
she called the pancakes
cakes
does she think they look like cakes or is she only getting part
no she says
pancake
I don't think she thought it was a cake
and then you said
hot cakes
it started with an h in the book
there's another different word for the same thing
she couldn't figure out what the jelly beans were you named
has she ever seen a jelly bean
no I try not to show her those things
we try not to
lollipops are about the only thing she's gotten into and maybe
but no I try to steer clear of those aisles
then there are words in these books that she has no experience with
yeah that's true yeah
at the end of the book she pointed to all of the things and she
toy
she understands things are toys
yes they are she has her toys she has her books and she
some parents say they make a distinction by saying
that's not a toy
I probably said that about some certain things around that she
but it is not a toy
she wasn't real interested in the truck book
no
she was interested on on the mass pike this morning
about the buses and trucks going by but not the trucks
we don't have any trucks
I don't have the little cars she's played with but
does she have any boy friends
yes she does
one that's one month younger than her and we are in a play
oh yeah he's got boy's toys
she does know boy versus girl now she was sort of developing
yes yes
she's into numbers now she always put one in front of
one or whatever she'll count to see if it's one two she's
I think it has a lot to do with Sesame street and Ernie and
they have the counting
the froggie too
she thought the boy had a ball on his head
a baseball
she thought it had a baseball in his hand Richard plays with
she's never worn one and she's always had so much hair I
she never had a cap
she was really into colors
she's been into colors a lot a long time she walks around
I can't imagine what it will be like pumpkins
you tried to point out to her the difference between a regular
we have a rocking chair and a regular chair at home with
she didn't really know what you were getting at
she doesn't just know flowers she knows kinds of flowers
from the garden
the garden's been great
not really because basically all that's zinnias or marigolds
I'm not sure I tell her what they are the roses only came out
I'll pick this flower
well she used to wear one they are around they are still in
and she's pretty neat now with eating so it's not that
she talked about having
toast and tea
is that what mother has for breakfast
yes
very familiar
most kids call it coffee
I don't drink it
no we don't have it around
she's used to tea y know not coffee
and eating toast in the morning
oh yes
it's in the car right now
d ya wanna sit down on that chair
you can sit down on that chair if you like
she doesn't eat out of glass bowls the big bowls like that
does she eat with all utensils now does she know spoon and
she's not sure what a knife is but I don't let her have one so
she wanted to eat something really weird with a spoon
she's getting really good at zipping up and zipping down does
zips the bag
her bag
she zips that up and down she unties real well
she's just beginning to put shoes on her self like her tennis shoes
and buckling
her clothing what does it have
it's mostly like this
just pullover very let's see the blue jeans now have
can she get in and out of them
the pants
she hasn't really tried
so she comes to you
yeah
she's doesn't really care y know one way or the other
she doesn't make any it not really
she doesn't like to take anything off
she's just happy with what she's wearing
my little nudist
she can zip things up but not down
that's because when you zip down when you zip these pants down
well she's not really sure that's what she should do first
think what I've noticed with the bag she's she's been really
but not zipping it back up
she didn't do much with the blocks but she was interested in
no and we have some beautiful wooden blocks too that she just
whereas the little boy Richard came over to the house and he
and she just has no desire to build
but she was interested in reading the blocks and she knew
just from reading the books
b is for boo boo
she started doing that
I with the drawing like just draw the c and the c is
what kind of words would you have exchanged
what was the b originally
no she ended up finding out b for boo boo herself the dog's
but she picked up the b for boo boo herself and c for Cindy
it's a weird letter
and cookie starts with c
yeah he's your friend
she was pretty good at identifying the animals on the sides of the
you talked about combing and brushing can she comb or brush her
she tries
she has the brush usually the opposite way
she has the hard part down on her head and the bristles
but she tries
and sometimes she gets the hair
is it easier for her to do it to someone else
for her to do it to someone else
I don't know she's
yeah she can get the brush the right way but it's hard for her
but she's tried dogs and dolls well the dog has such
and Gus is so soft it's not like he has anything to comb either
can she pretend that she's feeding a doll at this point
yes
she she had a pretend tea party and she fed all of her little
she was making all the little out of
oh we had gotten some clay recently she's been playing with
she'll say it and it'll be sort of a little weird however I
then when she can say it again she usually cleans it up a little
do you have to say
say it again
or does she do it herself
if you say the word over again does she repeat it
sometimes sometimes she doesn't
depends on what time she feels
but she often will
books
she's got several books not like this
this is one of the cutest books I've ever seen it's a an
it's cute
she's got one of these she likes to put things
I don't I really don't know if she's that familiar
there is a dog where she sometimes goes to the
one of them's kitty and the other one has another name
no we just started calling it that and
yeah very small ones
she stacks em
throws em
carries em around as many as she can at once
I thought she might know kitty but that's about the only
I don't think so
she might know boy
she's been exposed to ducks but I don't know how well she knows
she brings em to me and makes me go through them over and
and y know sometimes she sits
like that by herself
she looks at em
she's got a Raggedy Ann and a another soft no
yeah just sit around
not as much as we used to
just peekaboo and y know behind
it's just you said it was a dragon so I just thought of
yeah I know what you mean I
it just never occurred to me to think of y know it's a
she has a puppet
sometimes she likes it
she'll make that little noise like she made with the dog
very loving to it and other times she could care less about
no and that was a new routine I'd never done that with her
yeah she feeds herself
yeah combs and brushes she'll brush
oh did I
I just called it a bunny cause it said bunny on it so
I think I've always used the word bunny no rabbit
yeah it seems like an easy thing to memorize y know one
yeah she has a number book at home
seven bunnies
yeah she lifts it up and goes that allo allo
and whenever the phone rings if like sometimes her father
she never says a word but a big smile comes on her face
she's got two toy ones
one of em's just like this a different color and the
I really don't know
she used to wrap this one around her neck and walk around the house
so but she does do that
ello hello
so y know so as though she had some connection
she runs to the phone
it's a big event
it's not when she's done playing
it can happen any time
with any number of things she likes to put things in
she likes to seems to like to put things in a an orderly
not every time once in a while I tell her but she
I think she knows put
put it away yeah
she wasn't too entranced with the phone this time she wasn't
I don't think so
she has one at home right like it
Just like it
does she use it
not really
I think the novelty's worn off
what does she do with a real phone
she immediately runs to where it is
and gets all excited
loves to pull on the cord if I don't keep it out of reach
and when she listens to voices smiles
but won't say a word
does she understand where the voices are coming from
I don't know
does she recognize if you say
Come here and talk on the phone
she'll come well she'll run to it immediately when it rings
you mentioned playing with the chair and the chair's just like
no not at all She has a little rocking chair like
do you think she recognizes that it's just like hers
I don't think so
she didn't really respond when I yeah
you tried a bunch of prepositions with her
you tried going up putting things in taking things out told
I think all of them
she says up all the time
when she wants up
and she says down when she wants down
not as much as up
that's her favorite word I think she understands almost all
I don't think I've used upside down before
she knows to take things out
does she put things in and out
oh yeah
yeah
she'll put things like her dirty clothes in her clothes
she can follow a lot of directions put it in there out there
she won't play with the blocks
has the novelty worn off
I shouldn't have done that
I won't get her a dragon
what does she do with blocks when she has them
she stacks em
and oh she loves to throw them that's the latest thing
smaller ones though that she throws
but she's definitely not into them these days
depends on her mood
sometimes she is but not today
does she have the Pat the Bunny book at home
no
you say
let's read a book let's look at the pictures
does she understand that concept
yeah for at home she will
yeah
does she have any favorite ones
she has a little book with nursery rhymes that she really
and She I don't know she sort a seems like
read I mean you know look at the pictures
she has about eight or ten books
that's it
again you pointed out boys and girls
probably not
she doesn't say little boy little girl
no not at all
do you make an effort to do that
I don't maybe I do I don't know
I did that I must I did in the book
and maybe I do I didn't think that I do
does she have little boy and girl friends
yes
well mostly little boys actually
there's one little girl but she's a bit older
there's not many little girls around where she is
she tried to smell the flowers
does she try to do that at home in the backyard
I've seen her doing it She likes to touch em I just
that's the first time I ever said I didn't even know she knew
you saw her looking in the mirror and said
who's that
do you think she knows
we look in the mirror together I don't know if I say
who's that
maybe I do
do you think she understands that that's her
I don't know
I I'm not sure
She didn't seem to remember what shoes are do you play with
she knows yeah in fact I don't know if you saw it
she she wasn't interested in the doll's shoes maybe because
she has sneakers and sandals she brings em to me I say go
does she try to tie them and untie them
yeah she unties them I have to double knot them
all the time
does she try to pretty up herself or other people
yeah she'll use a brush on her own hair and in fact if
it's one of her favorite things
Does she drink out of a cup do you call it a cup
some well she has some things I call cups and others that
I think she knows cup but she just wasn't that interested
but it broke apart and I never got her a new one but whenever
so that's they way
you used the term
food
it's a pretty broad term do you think she knows
I think so When it's lunchtime I'll say let's go
Let's are you ready for lunch
she'll just drop what she's doing and run into the kitchen and
I use eat yes I do I don't think meat comes up very
I don't think that means anything to her
she knows no I'll say I'll say
ya want some more chicken
or hot dog or sandwich food might be to entice her
yeah she says it too
When she wants more Yeah if she's eating
I don't know
I guess I said
night night
and she can identify with that
feeding it dinner and it's things that she does herself I
she thinks it's fun to do it with something else
like some kids do it with dolls but she doesn't play with
does she have anything that's sort of like a doll
she has lots of dolls half a dozen dolls
but she doesn't try to put them to sleep
or feed them meat or
nothing Nothing she just y know she just smile at
what do you think about the dragon besides its function is so
She could have fed the dog or the boy
I think it's the fact that I was making the dragon move
and it was
but she isn't interested in putting her own hand in there
no I had to be there to do it
that's the main thing
does she have any puppets
yeah
yeah
does she play with them
no but she enjoys it when I play with them with her
it's I think it's a function of me doing it
does she try to feed you have a dog
we have cats
yeah but she sees dogs They are around
does she feed the cats
yes
she feeds she feeds she loves to feed the cats
she wants to feed them everytime she sees them
y know it's a big event
does she feed them the way she's trying to feed the dragon or does
I'll put food in the dish and she'll carry the dish and
so
so she's not doing what she's doing here
no
what sort of toys is she most interested in right now
she loves puzzles and I read a lot of books to her
as much as you can read at that age
does she have any particularly favorite books
I have one called
Good night Moon
that she likes
why do you think that's
cause she's really intrigued with the moon
why don't you play over here
see all the fun toys
ya wanna sit in here again
okay
are there any other toys that she's really interested in
let me think she has a little record player
and I bought her a little cup and saucer set and
that kind of thing She likes outdoor things
riding her little tricycle and In fact that's all she wants to
the first thing in the morning
outside outside
but she will if shut in her room play with toys otherwise
or she follows me around and helps me do chores around the house
like well she'll unload the dish washer for me y know
so she's not so interested in toys as she is in doing things
like I don't know She seems She seems like she loses
and I'll buy her something that I'll think she'll be interested
I don't know
she likes real things
like she she likes to get into my pots and pans and
or something unique like clothes pins she likes to help
by handing me the clothes pins the doggie
does she understand those concepts
yes she says house when she sees house
real houses
yeah she says house y know we'll be going along and
so she does know what a house is
on the doll and on the dragon you pointed out some body parts
she knows all of them I think so cause she even said
and she recognizes that what's in the dragon's mouth is a tongue
yeah I think so
where's the tongue Dale
see she said tongue
she was into taking things in and out does she like that
yes
yes
she likes taking things in and out
I don't know what she was doing but I have a potted plant and she
all this dirt under the rug
but little things like that she does like
you asked her a couple of times what her name was
does she know what the names of things are
yes
she calls some people by name
she calls people by name but does she understand the term
your name or it's name
I think so because sometimes she'll answer with her name
when she reads books she does that only with you not by herself
once in a great while she'll read a book by herself
but it's very short and mostly she'll bring it to me if I'm
will she turn the pages by herself
she'll try it depends if they are those thick pages I
unless it's just grabbing and that kind of thing she really can't
when she got to the part about
Mommys ring
she really didn't compare it to her own
do you think that's too abstract for her
I think she was just kinda bored with it
She has that book
I got her that book
and when you get towards the end she sort a loses
she didn't play with the blocks
yeah she's not into blocks very much any more
except to throw them
do you have any feeling why they are not very interesting to her any
I don't know She has a lot of blocks at home but she
she likes to throw em if anything
so I don't know why not
she seems to treat the dog appropriately
how does she know what to do
well maybe because the cats get fed maybe she's
I guess it is from observing
I don't really know
never thought about that
she wasn't very much into the phone today
she never has been
when I come here
someone said that phone just doesn't look very much like a phone
she has toy phones but she doesn't play with those either
but she does talk on the real phone now and then like her
I guess it depends on her mood
maybe if anybody's watching
that could be
she was all by herself just in her room talking up a storm
of gobbledy talk y know not
if you can call it that
with these goobly words you never ask her to repeat a word so
You don't say things like
can you say this
are you unconcerned about how well pronounced her words are
well I want her to have a good pronunciation but I figure
I don't care if she doesn't perform perfectly at two years old
I think it's neat that she's talking and saying things and
she's pretty vocal on her own I just figure I'd rather
just anything she wants to say and worry about the
if a stranger says
can you say that
what does she do
you mean like adults that come and say that to her
I guess because I have heard people come up and say
what's your name
and so I'm teaching her to answer with her name and probably
she's very talkative to people She'll always say Hi and Bye bye
she's already talkative
so I guess maybe just to say her name but seems like she
she's into counting these days and you are into counting
what's her ability to count
we are my husband as I are curious about that
she kinda picked up her letters quite spontaneously and I
but she came home from her play group counting one day
and I thought it was primarily because of repetition she picked up
but my husband and I are wondering if she doesn't
now today she didn't demonstrate that very well
but we saw her playing by herself one night after he'd come
we were talking in the kitchen and she just naturally sort of
and she had some wooden spools and she had them in a semicircle
so my husband and I sort a observed her from the doorway and
and he also wondered the same thing
we hadn't discussed it together
and he went out and he asked her how many there were and she
he removed one and he asked her how many there were and she
five
whereupon we decided that really there was something
so we've y know we've encouraged her to count but I
y know other than being exposed to this book which is
I mean I hadn't sat down and taught her one two three
and neither had he and neither had my daughter
and I've quizzed the baby sitter and she hadn't either so
it's something you are interested in knowing the answer to
or if if she's so fascinated she lies and counts by
with pleasure
I mean it gives her great pleasure to to count and if
or give her an enviroment that will promote it
it's not uncommon for skills to be uneven at her age so that one
when things are done under the child's initiative they tend to be
I see
well today obviously I was trying to get her to to to
and she substituted that at one point I think
the counting for the colors
I don't remember that
I asked her how many no I asked her what color the crayons were
mother get off my back
does she have blocks at home
I've forgotten
yes she does
does she do anything with them
yes she does amazing things with the flat wooden blocks
she plays with occasionally but her baby sitter
and they are incredibly wonderful
and she every night creates something with them
and they are very interesting blocks
they they they go perpendicular or this way
she was more interested in destruction she was less
does she do that at home
she does not have a toy telephone and as a result she
and she does talk to her daddy regularly
and occasionally her friends
my husband would not let me buy her one
because she had a doll on her one crib machine and he felt
and I acquiesced
this one was only a buck ninety nine
I know it was still I think it's the principle of the thing
and everybody has them so really she doesn't
at home does she ask for help
if we are working together I sometimes volunteer it for
she was more comfortable in the chair than on the floor
does she prefer to play in a specific area rather than run around
yes
she does have a play corner
and she doesn't run loose she's very categorical about her toys
she doesn't have anything like that at home does she
no
she has a small table with a free standing chair
and that's where she plays she plays in that corner
oh no that's in the kitchen actually
she does some work there
she has a standing up table in the play area
and we cleaned it up and it's it's beau she has
with her little little people
that's interesting because she was very confined in her play
she wanted to be there
you urged her to climb back into the chair by herself and she
does she do any climbing around things
oh yes she's she capable of climbing in and out of well
and we had to dismantle it and put her in a youth bed
she has not been containable once she wants to get out of something
or into it
she's she'll climb into her play pen if it's set up for
and she's very capable of climbing
discussion of Gail's knowledge of
what animals say
she knows all the animal sounds
I found it rather boring to go y know ask her to emote
you asked her at one point
what kind of animal is that
and of course the word animal is sort of abstract compared with
yes because we've been to the zoological museum at
this time you asked about boy and girl
last time she was fairly silent about that this time you
yes I'm good and I'm a girl
so
does she indicate when you are out shopping for instance that she
oh yes
and in pictures she can identify from dress which is the boy
she goes to a play group with primarily girls except one
he's a little boy
to it connotes that he's always crying but her friends
but we've been talking about big boys and big girls little
you also said
what's your name
what's his name
does she understand the concept of a name for something
I don't think she has the concept
she has names for all her dolls but we've named them as they
all all her dolls and many of her animals I don't know
but she does understand names of people she knows she knows
likewise you asked her
how old are you
likewise that's a routine right
both of those things I'm sorry the name I've been trying to
my name is Gail
when she's asked and to ask another little friend of hers if
what is your name
my name's Gail
and we've done this in the car as a kind of exercise as well as
how old are you
and I don't think she has gotten the
how old are you
bit into her head at all
this is in case she gets lost
yes
Lexington
I think
she knows that we live in Lexington but I don't think she really
she's still into the Pat the bunny book what shrts of
well she can recite if you ask her she knows all of Peter
she knows all of make way for ducklings she knows all of this
with the doll with all the funny parts on it she indicated that
which ones of those skills do you feel she has the ability to do
well the zipper she knows how to zipper herself
but you had to hold it down for her
well that zipper's well she doesn't get it started and
it's frustrating and the button is to her I think she's
I don't think she's ever buttoned and the shoelaces
we fool around with laces but I haven't taught her how to tie
she's she's interested in watching me tie her shoes
can she untie her shoes
oh yes
unties everyone's shoes
you pointed out his hair his hat his hands
she's been very interested in she turned last week to her
she has hands
little fingers on them
and it looked so cute
I remembered it and today she mentioned that he had hands
does he have
wh else she mentioned the digits there so
you said
put your hand in the dragon and make him come alive
do you think she understands that
yes because we have a rabbit at home that she a puppet
she enjoys him both ways she likes him inanimate and she
I noticed that when I was going through some of the play
we've been doing that with her dolls to with her
she really thinks it's her thing
it is
but my husband comes home and his voice goes way up
and she'll come and she's very serious about it and she
but she really believes it but then every now and then
it was funny she wanted to feed it cheese and toast and
are those her favorite foods
she's been starved for three days ever since her attack of
and yesterday was just a nightmare for her
she kept going to the refrigerator and saying
well how bout some pickles
or
how bout a donut
and it was just killing
it was so difficult
and today was the first time she's had bananas and wheat
and she's just so delighted that she had crackers and chicken
an she's just she's loved again
so she's got she's got things that she wants to eat on her
she'd love to eat some cheese
she's not gonna have it for a few more days
she thought the meat was toast
she knows what meat is
but apparently toast probably appeals to her right now a
she really would like it
so she's probably
she did a lot of talking about animals this time
more she seemed to recognize animals she didn't last time but
how come she didn't remember the zebra
does she really know the zebra or
yes
she does
we've been also looking in pet stores at the fish
she really knows what it is
it didn't come easily to her
was it the picture perhaps
one of the things you ask her to do is name a lot of things
does she spontaneously do a lot of naming
I think she knows them
I I think she's I'm encouraging her to
I don't think she would ever say something I think if she
and I don't think she knows a shoe in a book as she does a shoe on
she's not really into reading books
apparently not
she loves them and she loves to sit and look at them but I
she seemed to know the Pat the bunny book
I don't I don't know where she we don't have it so
n she seemed to know right away to turn to the page with
and she knew she patted the bunny which surprised me
it's possible just because everybody has it that she's seen it
does she have blocks at home
she does
she has a set of about fifty little blocks and while I
herself
and that so that's something new that she
the shoes seemed to be some sort of an attraction they are new
they are not
she has gotten this thing about shoes in the last few weeks and
and started taking them off
how do ya like that
and she knows about socks
has she said the word sock
these things all look so different I mean my shoes and socks
she has been around no less than six or eight people a day for
there wasn't too much in there that looked familiar to me
from her experience
were there any that did
well I think the milk she was saying milk at lunch today
put these way in the box
well she knows keys but I don't know if she knows the word
and I think a lot of those things apple that she would eat an
well she does call it she does say apple
but I think it's generally for apple sauce
she knew egg
she I think she does because when I say egg she comes
she loves eggs
and but I
didn't she say egg
it sounded like it
but lately she has repeated almost every word we say so you
she's got a kissing routine
oh she kisses a lot
she kisses things more than people
she'll kiss dogs and and toys and things she's not big at
does it make things better
no watch Kay
she likes watches
who is this kid Scott
Scott is well her nephew who she has just been in love with for
and she says Scott about every other word out of her mouth has
would she play on the telephone if he were on the other end
we haven't had our telephone with us while we've been away so
so I ven't played with a telephone with her for over two
she seemed to sort of know what to do with it
yeah but this as I said before this one is different from
anyhow so I think she was just
yours is
a dial
she knew some things about the cage the door you called it
no
I don't think she would know what a cage is
has she seen one
maybe a cat's cage we have a cage for our cat
but I don't know if she's really seen it
you showed her how she could work the puppet put her hand in it
do you think that she understood
well she has a puppet that we've been surprised that she
she doesn't know how to work it but she likes to put her hand in
and kind of wave it around
can she name body parts
don't think so
she knows a lot of them but I don't think she knows doesn't
I know she knows I know she knows nose and mouth and
about the hair brush
yeah that's one of her best toys
does she brush her own hair or others
everyone's
her own and other people's
oh she brushes our cat much to his dismay
does she handle it well
very well I think
I am surprised that she brushes her own hair pretty well
do you think she knows that that abstract little thing is a house
no
does she use the term
I think that when some people play with blocks with her they say
so she would say the word house but I don't think she knew what
just meant I'm gonna do blocks
you asked her to smell the flowers in the Pat the bunny book do
she knows what flowers are
we have been going all summer to kind of a wild place in Maine
and my mother picked her one flower one day and since then she
and she never goes outside without handfuls of flowers
does she smell them
she smells them other people smell them
in fact she wanted to pick the flowers in the nice little
you asked her what her name was
I ask her that about five times a day
and she doesn't have an answer
do you think she understands what a name is
I think she does
I think she's just playing with me she won't say it
does she umderstand other people's names
she knows my name's mommy and daddy's name is dada
does she give the pets
not really because
she decided it's time to go home
do you think it's possible to get her back here for one more
yes but the reason that I called you now is because we are going
is she into books more now
pretty about fifty fifty books with everything else
all of her toys as compared to books she'll play with half the
does she have any particular favorite book
no
no
she prefers I think just the structure of hard books rather
you have cookies down here honey
look at all these
if you are sitting down will she tend to pick up one that she
I don't think so I don't think
she likes to do the Judy and Paul book does she have
she doesn't
and I don't know and she did that last time too and to my
does she understand the concept of smelling flowers
she likes to smell flowers
and does she try things like putting her finger through little
yes
in her head
but she's never had practice with putting her finger through
yes
she plays with our rings and watches and jewelry a lot so
I can't remember if she's the child who always kisses everything
she hugs things a lot and I don't know where she got that
them and oh
I guess we must have done it
we do so many things unconsciously that we don't find out until
she knew the names of a bunch of animals today
she has a monkey that's a puppet
that's why she was calling that a monkey
cause that's the only that's right that's the only
so she thought that was all puppets are monkey's I guess
but she could say duck and doggie
yeah we have a book with those in so she knows I guess
what's her repertoire right now
that's about the the limit
she knows birdies
she's very good at imitating and you often say
can you say this
do you do that at home a lot
and she says it
usually if she's in the right mood she'll repeat whatever
are there any times when you especially like to do that with her
not really
just whenever I have time
do you do it to get a word out the first time or do you also do
I found that when I want her to learn a word I say
can you say something
but after she's started saying calling something by a word
then she'll say again
she was into the dog you have a dog
no we have a cat
does she understand the concept of
house
her own is very big
does she have any doll house or
no but she knows about other people's houses
she knows where her friends live we walk down the street
and she knows her own house she knows her grandmother's
she didn't say brush but you seemed to feel that she knew it
she plays a lot with my hair brush
she has a new little toy that she plays with all my hair things
go get the hair brush
because she'd carried it away from me or
what is this
and she said something that sounded like hair brush
so I know she knows the word and I think she said it
can she do her own hair
she can she does
she brushes her own hair in one direction or another not
not into the blocks
she likes her blocks
but they are a little smaller and more more interesting I
there's lots of them in there
easier to build higher things with
what does she tend to do with them
put one on top of the other on top of the other on top of the
does she
yes she has she I don't know why but I allowed her
and she has one book that is like this book
I think it's made by the same people
and it has doors that you open
and it s animals
and then they go to bed
and you open the door and see them sleeping
and she loves that with each little door
she takes things in and out
yes and she has been for a long time
that's one of the ways that we keep her busy
little things in things
you asked her to show you the eyes and she didn't do that
she does
yes
to Kay Kay
do you know where your eyes are
she knows her eyes and her ears
she'll point towards we worry about her eyes says
eyes
and she knows ears and mouth and nose and toes nose is her
nose
no
I don't think she knows either
she said man yesterday but that's the first sex difference
do you think that's because she doesn't find them useful
I think yeah I don't think there is much difference for
she was real big on the breakfast foods
and her favorite thing is raisin Bran and she just as you can see
can she drink on her own
yeah
does she have favorite things
no she just likes to drink
she'll just drink water and just drink it
she likes glasses and cups
juice is anything liquid
will she call milk juice then
she calls everything juice water grape juice and milk are
anything liquid is juice
no she has her own but it's a regular bowl
how old is Lena at this point
she's gonna be two October fifth so twenty two months
she knew a bunch of words in the basic vocabulary book
she knew about things like spoons and a cup does she name
no
but
they are named
they are named for her
what are the sorts of things you name for her
well it's not conscious
it's saying
Maura get the bowls for the cereal
we need the spoon
where's your napkin
does anybody need more juice
around the table you wouldn't say for instance
what's that
that's a spoon
no
she does know what a brush is does she use one at home
last night she did the most extraordinary thing
she found a comb and she was combing my hair and
which I thought was extraordinary
she uses a brush usually
because she named the brush but not the comb
didn't name
no I was surprised
no she knows comb
I would say she knows comb better than brush
because that's what she used on the kid's hair
you kept probing for that and
she wouldn't say it
no
you are dressed
I'll fix it
she has a whole bunch of interesting phone routines
you say
say hello hello
Say
how are you
you do that with her
yeah
she repeated one of them
how are you I am fine
yeah it sounded like that
yeah that's what she was I think
so when she gets on a phone she actually talks to people
no when she gets on a real live phone she doesn't say a word
that's Grammy
but
she doesn't just name something she'll say
that's something
yes talks and uses words grammatically
yes she does
give it to me Here this is yours
I mean it's all very grammatical
a couple of times you asked her if she needed help with things
does she ask you when she needs help
or do you have to intuit that she needs help
no she'll ask
what will she say
she'll say
Help me
she actually says that
I didn't hear her do that
well under the circumstances I was right here
but if she was trying to do something she would come and get me
help me
open the door
I wanna go outside
the dolly is stuck
whatever and she'll tell me as much as she can
I was going to ask if she can take her clothes on and off and I
no she can
are there things with her clothing that are easier for her to take
most of her dresses have buttons in back
so she can't get those off
her nightgowns that have buttons in front I have to to pin
because she'll take them off
in the middle of the night
her underpants she can't get off
can she put clothes on a doll
they she does but she does it it's not that she's
or she'll go and she'll get clothes she'll put on my shoes and
you asked her at one point what the doll's name was
does she name dolls
no Well Maura does I've never watched I don't
cause Mommy's name is Cassy
and if she's Mommy she calls me Cassy
isn't that interesting
when she named the keys she didn't say keys she said
car keys
well those are Mommy's keys and that's Where she sees them
you were trying to narrow down her definitions of some words
normally she calls sneakers sneakers sandals sandals slippers
They are very different things
do you deliberately try to narrow things down like that
I I may
I don't realize it if I'm doing it
I mean I think what I probably do is say “Let's put on your
let's put on your sneakers
let's put on your sandals
let's put on your boots
just and I don't know what I do
you pointed out that one picture was the Cow jumps over the Moon
do you do nursery rhymes with her
not as much as I should
Well I'm just aware of what I did for Maura
and less for Jeff and virtually nonexistent for this
does she know rhymes like that
I think so
she likes that one
she always laughs when she hears about the
dish ran away with the spoon
she thinks that she thinks that's funny
does she know what the moon is
I doubt I doubt it
I don't know
yes because the last time we went to my mother's house we did
Where's Grammy's lake
lake is a very advanced term for such a young child
she said as we appro as we pulled into the driveway
this is Grammy's house
where's Grammy's lake
because she had only seen the lake once
she won't let go of me
oh she went swimming at Lindsey's house
yes she is extraordinarily good in the bath tub and the little
but once she's got the life preserver on in deep water she clings
you said that the bath tub is to get the baby clean
does she understand that
yes
she washes her face clean
after she has she eats if she spills anything on her dress
she takes the washcloth and washes her hands and then she
she really used the phone a lot this time compared to other times
does she use her toy telephone at home
we just got a new one
the old one was broken
and has she been using it
I wouldn't say so but I may be wrong
does she use the real telephone
no
how does she know what to do
oh that's just the telephone routine
she may not do it on the real telephone but she may do it on her
I mean if she's playing I'll say
call daddy and ask him what he wants for lunch
yes that I will do
when I see it but it doesn't happen every day
will she talk if grandma calls
sometimes she will
sometimes she'll just listen
probably she doesn't expect it to happen so and because I
no but she sees Maura's hair in the morning and she sees me do my
yes she's been taking my brush
and brushing her hair
brushing my hair
does she brush her dolly's hair
I have never seen her do it but she's taken very good care
put this away in the box
she wanted to feed the dog
where has she learned to do that
nobody that we know has pets but she may have seen
the doggie needs his hair combed
yeah go find his house
she was into the books are there certain books that are more
I don't think so
but she does pull the books out of the bookcase and reads them to
no she looks at the she likes reading the telephone book
she picked up a bible one day and said
Jesus
very interesting
but with her own little books picture books
you asked what color the apple was and she answered
apple
sometimes she comes out with the right answer
I don't know whether it's a lucky guess or whether she really
what color's this
she'll say blue green red or yellow and a lot of times
you were trying to get her to match colors
you told her the orange was the same color as her shirt and the
probably not
she wasn't concentrating on it so I would say not
she wasn't paying I didn't think she was paying attention to
I think she was thinking
I don't think I would ask her what color this orange is I'd
Lena is that blue
what color's mommy's dress
see I'm not sure she really knows but she knows colors and when
she was very careful to delineate boy and girl do you have
I know
she said
that's a girl
and I would have said it's a boy
but I noticed that the hair was curly maybe that's
does she do that with real kids
she does it a lot faster sometimes than I do
she seems to be right I mean I'll look
is that a boy or a girl
and she'll say
that's a boy
and I'll look closely and say
right it is a boy
I would like to know what she I I'm looking at too
I can't think
we are going into winter and she has a jacket with a zipper
this sweater has a zipper in the back
so she's never I can't think of anything that she's owned
so I couldn't tell you or not up or down is easy
she had a pretty good grasp on it but didn't know how to
when you showed her the snap and asked her what it was she said
it's broken
she was very good with food names
and the ice cream I put in the mugs they've had their milk in
talks about
this is for me
exchange
no
she really knows
she really uses it correctly
she says
this is his this is Jeff's this is mine this is
she knows
are there some things she's beginning to get territorial about
her dollies
the other things are things nobody else would want anyway
her slippers her nightgown her clothes her room
she's very good about sharing
much better as I noticed at her birtday party than
the concept seems to be deep and she's willing
the thing that occurred to me is the whale had blue around it
I looked again and I thought
maybe you could think it was clouds
you had to name the mouse and turtle
does she know them or were they bad pictures
no she knew turtle she didn't know the mouse and I
like a mouse
I have a note here that's sort of cryptic
you asked her if she could build a tower and she said
meow
oh yeah
I said did you want to match it match it or something
I give up
noise is unbearable
she seems to know two in fact she's three because I can
Maura has a doll house
but she's talked a lot about a big house
the big house
there's my house when we drive past it
that's my house
and she's been playing with the bigger Lego blocks
lately she's been drawing on things
everything
including jackets coats walls floors couches and
she seems to have a routine with you when she plays with the ball
she'll do predictable things
yeah well I let her play by herself like today she
but sometimes it's more of an interaction like when she
and she catches it
yeah
she does
yeah
with a bigger ball it's easier for her t play y
she seems to know a lot of the items in the room here she was
does she walk around labelling things at home
let's see
mommy wants to put diapers on you
I think she does label things
I think yeah that she is learning a lot of new words
about the puppet first of all you've apparently taken her to
a zoo she just went to the zoo yesterday
so it's fresh in her mind
right
and she liked some of those animals
she said tiger owl goose
no she really did see a goose
goose
and she's been
and she has seen all these the neat thing about it is she
yeah so that it sort of made it more realistic for her
first you told her the dragon was in a cage and then you told her
box
no
I noticed that myself
I think I thought at the time that I called it a box
so it's probably some ambivalence on my part about her
she was very much into the box itself
does she do a lot of playing around with
boxes
I think all kids when they see a box
are you the mother who indicated that she's an incessant opener and
oh no
I think all kids do when they see
oh you want that to be opened
y know box when they get gifts they enjoy the wrappings
with the dragon you were pointing out face parts
she definitely did know how to name them
do you practice things like that
yeah yeah we do
yeah
we did when she was a lot younger when I first realized that
the sort of use of the face to learn
parts of the body
she's pretty good now
yeah she's pretty good
she's got eyes and
well she knows chin and ears and tummy
things like that
and she doesn't say arms or legs yet
she was pretty fascinated with the dragon's tongue
puppy
got a puppy
she wasn't too fond of the telephone although she played with it
just yeah she does have a routine
that's funny like you don't I think I'm not really aware
she goes to the phone and she'll
she'll lift up the the receiver and she'll say
byebye
byebye or hi hi
and she talked to her meme and pepe her grandparents on the
so I sort of prepare her for that
we are gonna go for the weekend
she was not fond of the books
this oh the books
I think she just didn't want to read books right now
she's more because books is kind of like a sitting down
and she wasn't into the blocks
the blocks
no
but she does play with blocks at home
quite a bit
she sort of got into the doll belatedly she liked the things
does she play with her own clothing
yeah not mutilate it no
I meant manipulate
some of the other children do that
yeah
yes she does but I think more mine
she's good with the zipper
yes she is
she's never done a zipper before
first time
this is the first time she's ever done a zipper
ever
that I've ever seen her
yeah she was good for the zipper
but because she nurses I unbutton my blouse usually
button button
and play with the my clothes
more than I've seen her play with her own although she probably
it was cute because the doll's wearing the same kind of clothes
yeah that's right
you were trying to call her attention to the fact that the clothing
do you think she
no I don't think she paid attention to that
does she play with her own shoes
yeah she does
I thought like I thought it was interesting that y know
maybe she's not ready for that concept
where are ya going Baba
walk
a walk a walk
she wasn't into sitting around is she more of a runner
marie we have to put your diapers on before we go home
look
what's under there
what's that
huh
that's you
are there times when she's more talkative than others
yeah next time maybe we can come maybe I'll come in the
some mothers say that when I'm dressing her she's talkative
when she's getting dressed no
no
not getting dressed cause I don't talk to her that much
and she's not that talkative when she eats those kind of
she gets crazy
and she just sort of for about an hour she talks a lot
she wanted to leave at one point and was distressed to find that
yeah she is
yeah she's I guess into doors
now
she learned how to open the door to our apartment and go out so I
but she always wants to go out
she has many more words
many more than before
was it six weeks ago that we were here
so like she's second
she's come a long way in terms of building vocabulary
she knew some words that she was using like her pants and her
generally what would you say she knows in that domain
clothing
diapers
she knows y know everything that she suits bathing
suit suit
ya wanna bottle okay
ba to
an then let's see hat she knows it hasn't
an she knows terms like tops and pants instead of dress I guess
oh yeah
a dress
she hardly ever wears a dress though
a couple o times she has she knows dress
you distinguished for her pants and jeans
does she call them one or the other
no
jeans is a word that she well she has used jeans
you talked about tying and untying the shoes and again you
no not usually
I just I have hard time getting her to sit y know to
can she tell the difference between shoes and sneakers
yeah she can
I think I think she knows that though that the same word
things she usually calls she usually calls those
but when I say sneaks she she says
sneaks
you said
just like yours
she looked
she understands then
just like yours yeah
with the dragon you got a bit simpler because instead of calling
a box
I did that again I did that last time
no she still hasn't been to a zoo to see cages
she has been to a zoo
and she has seen cages once
she has but she was sort of frightened more than
and she associated these bars with her crib because she said he
so I didn't feel like I wanted to confuse it any more
so I think that's probably why I didn't push it with the
there was this long discussion you had with her about
keys for the door
keys for the car does she fool around with keys a lot of kids
yeah she does
she does
an she knows she said that before that whole a segment
I don't know if other kids do this but and you just
some kids call them car keys right away
she was cute with the dragon sticking her tongue out
do you play funny games like that with her
yeah we do when we have the time we try I think sometimes
does she have any puppets at home
did I ask you that the last time
will she put her hand in it
yup
she will
this is a little different though but she did put was
this time
she's got the term toys and toys encompass a lot of things
I know exactly why that is
it's because she bugs me at home when I'm in the kitchen and
that dragon doesn't come out honey
her toys are in her room or the living room and they are not
and if I'm doing something in the kitchen and I want to have some
go and play with your toys
in your room' and she'll say toys and depending on how she
she was very big on the chairs
does she have her own chair
no
but she is fascinated with the chairs
she climbs up and down onto the kitchen chairs and highchairs all
something
she said
eat eat
she obviously associates them with
eating sitting in the chairs to eat
yeah that's right
books right
she obviously has a lot of stuff in the the Pat the bunny book
yeah she has that book at home
you were trying to get her to distinguish the boy from the girl and
y know it's it's funny
I thought that she definitely knew that Paul was Paul or
cause for a long time she's been calling them by their
and doing it quite consistently
except today she confused them so
but you were trying to point out to her that one was a boy and
that one was a boy and one was a girl
well I think that because she's still she still calls
so in the beginning all children were boys
and now they are either boys or girls depending on I don't
I've got something for her to eat
now I think she is calling when she sees a girl sometimes she
it's hard I don't think she really distinguishes them
she likes to read apparently and she had a lot of words in the
does she use one
a comb
no I use a comb though
and so she knows that I do and the brush although I use a
she knew the eggs
yup
does she eat those
no uhuh
but she knows what they are
well actually I used to use eggs she does eat eggs I guess
so I use them in cooking
you have a back yard right
a small one that she never really plays in
she was talking about picking flowers smelling flowers
at her grandmother's house every time we go there she
for mummie
does she like to pick the flowers
oh yeah
she likes to pick anything
if we go in the store she likes to pick leaves off bushes
she talked about patting them and later about patting the
patting for her is well if she's not supposed to touch
I said not to touch the tape cause we don't want to take it
Pat it
or something
she said
Pat
and she kissed it
and she kissed it
and then pat it
so that's another constellation of of behavior that she
and children were beginning to hit her
the learning not to hit to be nice and that involves kissing
she didn't do much with the blocks today she was most
no she usually makes a tower
I think she was she was clapping for herself when she made a
like that she she felt that she was successful at that
the lining on the floor is just something that I did and I
but I was having a hard time trying to think what we could do with
you talked about things in the past going for a walk
I think she do I think she does
because I'm since I've been working I worked yesterday
and I often ask her what she's done the day before
and she can tell me y know pretty truthfully and
but it's not sophisticated
it's just it's usually common activities but she's told me
she went with Suzy or Annie for a walk
the walking thing was just in general
what does she do
when she walks she holds hands
with the other babies in her play group
ya wanna get out of the chair Monica
she seemed to be into the phone although she doesn't say anything
she never she actually insists that she talk
pretty consistent with what she does with the real phone
she'll just say
hi hi
you said she likes this phone because it rings does it ring
no I think she liked the ringing there are some
hi hi hi
but there's no ringing associated with it an that was more
but at home she can't make that phone ring at her will
this is very important to leave this on mummie
I'm gonna talk to Nan for a couple o more minutes
okay
she wants to nurse I think I can probably talk while she nurses
do ya wanna nurse
huh
you have to leave that on
don't touch that though
don't touch
it's not touching this
it's just that it might be picking up her sucking
I don't know if it would or not
with all these toys that have insides and outsides like the cage
take it off
is she like that at home
what sorts of things does she
I think that she is
take it oh that word that phrase she says
take it off
or she she doesn't usually say
put it in
but
take it out
take it out
I can't think of anything offhand right now
but like her sweater something she'll wanna take it off
all of a sudden she'll get an idea that she wants to take it off
put it on
but she has a little hard time putting it on herself
so I'm starting to help her do that
shoes clothing
in general
does she try to pull things out of other things
yeah she does but I can't think like just her toys
actually I'm probably not very good I don't know what
I guess she's been going full time for four weeks
at school
and I have only been here with her this week
or two days
so I actually don't have that much idea in terms of what she
she they do have a lot of educational toys there that she's
little holes
and that she's spends an hour trying to do that
n she's able to do it so that she is fascinated
don't touch
just don't touch that
okay you are going to have to stop nursing if you touch it
does she understand the difference between things that are toys and
I think she does
maybe in more of a negative sense than I'd want to
sometimes it's my own fault because sometimes at home she will
and in the kitchen and I'll be tripping over her an say
Marie go play with your toys
in your room
no she'll say
no
and I think she does knows what are toys an what aren't
that's not a toy
we are not gonna play with that right now
although I'm not consistent because I do let her play with
such as make up
when she was working with the make up she seemed to know
parts that it goes on I don't know if it's helped her I
what parts of her face does she know now
I think she's aware of all parts of her face in fact
n and she has words she says
for her face
cheeks ears eyes brows tongue
gums
she was very aware of the tongue as a matter of fact she
tongue the tongue right
does she do that
pick out one characteristic
yeah
tongue
tongue
yeah there's that tongue in there huh
has she done that with anything else at home
let's see yes
my husband's been feeding her in the morning oatmeal
a cereal with some sunflower seeds and sesame seeds and raisins in
you had to tell her a lot about the house
do you the she would have noticed that that was a house
I don't know
I don't think so
she may have
but they don't look that much like houses to me
I think that's why I chose to tell her
that it was to just although of course she could have
okay let's go Marie
