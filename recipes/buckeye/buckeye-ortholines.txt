okay 
um 
i'm  
lived in columbus my entire life thirty four years 
um born and raised on the west side of columbus 
um 
um i'm a um 
it's kind of a unique position  i guess i'm a um 
my 
job title is a senior research associate 
um 
i received my um bachelors masters p h d and nurse practitioner all from here from o s u 
and i'm working down at dodd hall in a research position i'm also a nurse practitioner down there that 
um 
sees patients in follow up and in clinic 
um they sort of created the position for me 
about a year ago after i had my little boy 
um 
working on three different 
um 
research projects with three different physicians 
two are  
um 
specific to the traumatic brain injury service looking at long term outcomes in people that have sustained traumatic brain injuries 
the other one is a drug study 
um looking at control of agitation 
and the other one is a um spinal cord injury 
research study 
it's  
no it's a uh 
clinical study where we're seeing how treadmill training 
effects ambulation in people with spinal cord injury 
so they're kind of spread out twenty five twenty five ten percent that's kind of how it's divided out 
between the projects 
uhhum 
um 
a nurse practitioner has more authority i guess to diagnose and see patients 
um the state of ohio is 
i think the only state that has a given 
um 
nurse practitioners prescriptive authority where we can write our own prescriptions 
so we can see patients do the physicals 
we can  suggest medications i guess per se but then the physician has to come in confirm our findings and then he actually writes the prescriptions 
yes 
and that's what i like 
correct 
exactly 
exactly 
but 
we're working on it we've gotta couple house bills in right now and 
see how things go 
be exciting 
yes 
i love ohio state but i don't  i guess from a career perspective they say it's not a good idea to get all your degrees from one place but 
i don't intend to ever leave here so 
i love 
yes 
yes 
yes 
i uh 
um 
uh 
lordy 
um 
grew up on the westside i went to  my husband went to  um 
proximity wise is probably within a mile of each other we were kind of high school sweethearts and 
the whole bit 
um 
his dad still lives in grove city my mom lives still 
at our old family house there on the westside 
and we moved 
um 
also on the westside probably couple miles from my mom 
no 
no 
no 
for me personally 
um 
family being close 
uh both sides of the family are here 
um 
for me familiar 
i don't like a lot of change a lot of new things 
um 
for me  
i was involved in i i swam for o s u swimming an got real involved with the o s u sports an just the sporting programs an 
i love ohio state football 
so i i like the sports 
there a lot of activities to do to now with my little boy 
going to cosi and the zoo and 
just knowing where things are and how to get around 
so family 
um 
familiarity and 
um 
just the community i think 
crime 
i think it's going 
and up 
um 
traffic is 
but the one  but i mean 
you need to go through that 
right now 
because columbus is expanding so much that we need the 
orange brailles 
and um 
i guess the lack of publicity nationally i 
i we don't have you know like the national football teams and 
now with the hockey coming i  think were getting more recognition but 
when people talk about columbus they then 
i don't think they know 
columbus ohio or columbus georgia or columbus 
where 
right 
right 
have 
right 
i don't 
know that much about it to be quite honest i did read about it in the paper and i know the whole thing with 
um 
chief jackson and the whole um 
mayoral candidates how they're getting in debates over that 
an i know this is something new on top of that um 
i know it was the front page on sunday's paper 
i looked at it briefly um 
i think there must be some truth to it i don't know 
the extent 
oh it's possible but i can't imagine it would 
not knowing how big it's going to get i guess i can't imagine 
that it's going to 
well it might make national news i just 
it was on national news 
you see i'm 
not that informed on that um 
there's so much negativity on the national news i don't know if that will just be blended in or if people will 
associate that with columbus 
right 
uh 
two and a half 
yes 
yes 
cosi's going to be opening up on the sixth um 
looking forward to doing that we had a um 
uh seasons pass to wyandotte lake spent a lot of time at the pools 
um 
different swim centers hunter 
different rec centers the y programs are excellent even here at ohio state they've got the um 
um 
recreational sports on sunday afternoons where they can go 
um 
we go to the zoo a lot 
libraries have story times reading hours those type of things 
um 
just 
all kind of community things easter egg hunts at the rec centers 
um 
yeah 
um 
up until 
march he was at home with my aunt with family watching him in our home 
an then my grandfather who's ninety five got 
um 
ill 
and my aunt had to choose between 
my son and my grandfather and 
um 
she's watching 
actually my grandfather's doing quite well now but she 
um 
watched him so we 
now have him 
in a day care 
um 
in hilliard 
oh 
definitely 
definitely 
i think it was more just a family preference i i preferred family um 

again with the news 
reports with uh um different bombings and the 
i think the jewish school 
caught my attention 
and now that he is in daycare 
i mean we did a pretty good screening but you still always kind of 
wonder what's going on 
he's done quite well he's i mean he's learned how to use scissors how to color he's 
socially learning how to play with other kids those were all things he wasn't 
doing at home 
potty training's been a big deal because all the other kids in class are doing it and 
uhhum 
yes 
yes 
he talks about biting even though he's never bit 
and um 
there's one particular boy right now when 
his family leaves he just has complete temper tantrums and he's tried that out a few times too 
he's one you can leave and 
it doesn't phase him he's very comfortable with other people but 
like last month or so he's tried that a few times and i think he picked that up at day care 
seeing the other kids do that 
quite possible 
but we  
the day care that i thought was closest to 
well 
the one that was 
had the closest values that we had 
um 
i 
personally would like a church based program but uh there aren't 
any 
well there weren't any open when we were looking for one 
um 
we did have the option of going here to o s u to their day care 
and 
it has a wonderful reputation an everybody that i've talked to that has had children there 
is very pleased with the program 
but what i didn't like was 
so that if they weren't 
um 
imparting values on the children 
they don't celebrate 
any holidays at all  they just kind of ignore 
everything 
where 
he is now 
i still like getting my mother's day card in 
i mean they're doing trick or treat thing on thursday they're going door to door they get to dress up or 
he wouldn't have gotten any of that 
at o s u and there pros and cons to 
to both of those but 
i guess almost at o s u i wish they would 
celebrate every holiday so then they're exposed to 
all of it instead of none of it 
right 
do kwaanza do chanukah do so that they can learn other cultures and the other values 
but they just 
don't 
do any of them 
yes 
uhhum 
right 
i think it's important to know what the person's values an customs are and to support whatever it is an if 
i mean we've done some wild things over there but i mean it's 
i mean we've changed rooms around beds around positions of how 
beds needed to be placed in order that they needed uh 
face the north star or uh they needed to have 
this thing above the bed or under the bed and 
i mean if it's important for them to 
have prayer then i think it's important to get the appropriate people over and encourage them to 
have whatever it is they need 
i don't think forcing prayer on somebody if they don't believe in it i don't think that's 
the right thing to do but 
i would have a hard time believing 
i mean if the person 
knew 
i would think if the person knew that people were praying for them at church and that was important to them and they 
prayed and 
i i uh 
i would find that hard to believe 
personally 
i've heard some of them talk about it 
yes 
none of it i mean it's kind of the traditional light at the um 
uh uh like a big tunnel with a bright light at the end or uh 
they were floating above themselves looking down at themselves at the accident scene uh 
um 
seeing a dead relative 
something like that 
i believe them 
i do i i i 
i mean it's a very personal 
thing and if that's what they saw 
most of my patients are head traumas so 
they can come up with some pretty 
wild stories but 
those visions are usually pretty clear and 
i don't argue with m i don't debate it it's just like 
it might 
no 
right 
no 
definitely and it really makes you aware of your own mortality i mean things you see every day i mean never know it can happen to anybody anytime 
just like that accident yesterday with um 
right 
i mean you just never know 
how freaky 
it's just weird 
right 
my father died when i was two so i think just being raised you know by a single 
parent 
made you well aware of 
um hum 
yes 
uh his mother died um the week after we got married 
she had diabetes um 
uh juvenile diabetes diagnosed at age eleven and just 
over the years um ended up having open heart surgery and 
didn't make it through the surgery 
my grandmother also died during open heart surgery so 
my perception of open heart surgery even though i'm a nurse 
not very good just because of 
the two 
family experiences 
nothing's coming to mind 
no 
oh wow 

no 
every once in awhile with my grandmother 
she 
always wanted me to become a nurse and i was a senior in high school when she died and 
sometimes i think boy 
she really like it that i was a nurse 
because i still use her blood pressure cuff an everything she had given me her blood pressure cuff i mean it's very old 
mmhmm 
yes 
no 
in germany 
mmhmm 
during the depression my grandfather 
um moved over here and then 
asked her 
to marry him and she moved over and 
they settled in springfield ohio and 
then my mom 
met my father 
um 
he was from pataskala they met here at o s u where they're going to college and 
they settled here in columbus 
okay 
small world 
must have 
yes 
so i think 
that's what i 
recall missing 
i know 
my 
sometimes 
i mean 
we've taken joey out to the cemetery a few times to 
go to the gravesite of his father and he says you know very often 
boy she would really liked to have been here 
and done things with him 
he's an aeronautical engineer 
um 
he started off here in columbus at janitrol they went out of business then he went to urbana 
for grimes aerospace  um they ended up merging in 
now there's really no aerospace things in 
columbus   he's working for  in plane city which is um 
uh 
kind heating and cooling air conditioning systems 
and so he's using his airflow design 
not on airplanes but on 
heating and cooling systems 
yes 
there's a huge wind tunnel yeah 
i don't know if it's where it is but i definitely remember him talking about doing different experiments and projects in the tunnel 
sort of and kind of yes we were i mean 
dated in high  but he ended up going to prom with somebody else and we  mean 
we 
we went to  
went kindergarten all the way through and my sister and his sister were the same age and my mom an his mom were campfire leaders together and the whole bit 
and then we didn't really  
and um 
kind of 
really didn't get together at all freshman year 
he did go 
to school here 
and then um 
as i said i swam for ohio state and then i went into agler davidson a sporting goods store to um 
buy a swimsuit 
my sophomore year 
and he was a cashier there 
and we started 
again and it was just like 
we hadn't missed any time and started dating 
sophomore year again and ended up getting married after i finished my master's 
eighty eight 
so we  we just had our eleventh wedding anniversary 
yeah 
i  
it that way 
i mean personally i i 
i 
i don't know 
there's so much 
i know about him and things i trust because i've known 
him forever 
there's so many i don't think people are as honest and truthful 
these days 
i don't know 
i would have a hard time really getting into a relationship with somebody 
that i met today not 
knowing everything about him 
why do i think that is um 
oh 
i would say family 
values customs traditions um 
divorce moving 
just looking at my sister my my sister 
i mean 
she's very happily married but 
my god i mean they 
they lived here in columbus he's from dallas 
they met here 
they moved to indianapolis they moved back here they moved up north they moved back 
now they're in london england they've been married what four five years 
and i think they've lived six different places 
they're just constantly on the  they just don't 
have the connection with the family  
and i don't know if that's a bad thing 
it's just 
they aren't 
right and and you aren't 
as close to your family and 
the traditions and the 
and i think you lose all of that and then you get so wrapped up in work and moving that 
i don't think kids have the center base to the family that they used to have and 
i don't know 
the the culture is just so fast paced that 
i don't 
are maybe it's not honesty maybe it's just 
they don't have as 
much time to get attached  they're ready to move on again you just don't get as close 
to people as you used to 
yeah 
right 
right 
i can 
of that 
i'm at a luxury i guess where we're at a position where 
i i truly don't have to work so 
if i ever felt that 
he was in jeopardy or he wasn't getting what he wanted 
or needed 
i would 
quit in a heartbeat to to  take care of that but 
having family with him the first 
year and a half 
um 
i don't know i got all my schooling everything out of the way 
i cut down to the sixty percent when he was born to have more time with him 
um 
i don't know it's a whole different society with emails and the 
computer and the internet and  the cell phones i mean it's 
in some 
regards it's much more connected but 
so impersonal 
and 
i think 
i don't know 
mom's being outside the home 
i think so many families are 
forced to do that with the cost 
and is it the cost or is it the wants 
the very material society right now 
but it's also a very 
um 
good economical time too the stock market 
overall's been up i know it's down right now but overall 
so the money's been flying  houses and buildings and 
right 
i mean pal is 
booming 
it uh 
and i think 
personally i could not have put him in daycare when he was an infant and i think i would have quit if 
a family 
would not have been available but since family was available 
and i think he's very social i think he was ready for 
the interaction with the other kids 
and three days a week isn't 
right 
right 
my husband drops him off and i pick him up so he's there for the shortest amount of time 
it's probably family by family i mean that we 
that's why i was a little bit late leaving 
work the way it was there  we've got two 
coworkers one 
um has her child at  same day care as as myself she's about a year now and 
and listening to her and 
i mean 
she's there you know sixty seventy hours a week 
i mean 
she 
dropped off at six a m and not picked up till six thirty p m and 
she's fine with that 
me personally 
there's no way because somebody is totally 
in my opinion 
raising that child you aren't getting to put your values your traditions 
what's important to you 
onto that child 
now the other girl she just has a four month old and has been in day care now for three weeks and 
she's gonna go 
she's she's gonna quit her job and go to um 
um 
night working nights three days a week 
because 
it is important to her to 
be at home with him 
um 
hum 

uhhum 
um 
right 
right 
right 
it's awful 
probably 
i mean i just even notice 
like road rage just in general like with myself 
when i was working full time even with my child at home 
just the frustration of getting home i was so stressed with work 
and now being part time 
i'm so much more relaxed i mean 
the pressures that these kids 
these days have on them 
and you're right without families at home to give them the guidance 
i mean at columbine if i'm not mistaken that was the one who had the journal who had 
somebody had made bombs in the garage and 
the family didn't know about it and i was like 
how can a family not know that 
but if they're so busy and working and trying to provide 
right 
wow 
um 
i don't know if there could be 
there are certain programs different community based programs getting 
but again those are my values as i say 
steering the kids into 
a church based program if they 
be there 
putting them with um 
families and friends that you know and trust to  to look after them giving them 
the guidance 
need 
the ymca programs are wonderful they give them 
a structured activity to do 
where they're supervised 
but again 
those programs a lot of times cost money that the families don't have and it may not be their values to put them 
in those type of programs 
i mean that goes along with my 
and beliefs i mean were going to send our child i already know to parochial schools there's no way i'm going to 
send him to a public school 
and even 
my 
my husband's a um 
boy scout 
um 
leader 
and just listening to the boys there 
he 
he did a program last night on 
respect 
just 
don't talk when other people are talking just 
general  
that i  you should take 
for granted 
that they just 
don't 
have those 
they're just not getting it right 
uhhum 
i want the discipline and i want the religion basis 
i want i don't want somebody 
i i want them to be able to 
feel like they can punish him and they can pray and they can 
from our friends that have gone 
yeah  with uh  their discipline is expelling 
the child from school 
while they're expelling them 
to a home 
where the parents working 
where they're just getting three days of free play 
i mean pretty much to get in trouble and cause more trouble 
they really aren't 
learning 
from that 
right 
i do 
i went to public 
um 
through sixth 
and actually 
i was quite pleased with the program but my mom also had me in um 
i don't know it's ccd class it's a  
it's uh monday nights you go and you get the 
um basis of the of the church 
and 
that was important to me and then um 
i went to 
um parochial school for seventh and eighth grade which was 
in my opinion horrendous 
but 
excuse me i think it's 
the age 
of the children in general you know the whole 
puberty thing 
and going into a new school where these kids had been together since kindergarten and trying to fit in at that age 
and then i went to parochial  i went to  
um 
for highschool and that was a very good experience 
uh new  the boyfriend  the 
different things they were trying behind the building you know it's just the boy girl i mean just 
not 
no 
very much so 
um hum 
i do think there's some 
and i don't think they probably get exposed to like the different walks of life i don't think they probably be exposed to you know 
the gay lesbian 
uh 
i think that would probably just 
be 
blown over and 
didn't go very much in depth you know about sex and your sex ed classes were pretty 
but on the other hand for me that was fine i don't know 
our friends it's have eleven year old that's going to public school 
i mean he had 
a 
class already 
where he had to carry around this baby he went we went to a hockey game with him 
and here he is with this baby at this hockey game 
and it was just like at eleven 
that's 
awfully young 
but again he's got this baby 
yet they didn't talk about 
how this baby 
how you make a baby 
or 
everything  
and i don't know if they should be talking about that yet but here he is with this baby and it's just like 
okay 
they do offer sex ed but it's 
you know 
very um 
scientific in nature 
and then we did have a um 
think it was actually in religion class where they paired you up you were a 
couple and 
you had to go through budgets and 
chores and it was more that type of task 
right 
right 
mm yeah 
right 
i don't know that's so controversial i mean 
i mean to the point i mean 
they show them how to put condoms on bananas in public schools and it's like well 
are you promoting sex then or  
do i  uh 
you could argue both of those too but i 
me personally i'd say that's just teaching them more than what they need to 
i think that's a little bit too much 
but then again i feel like sometimes i'm so naive 
i mean 
a lot of that wasn't introduced you know i was just like well 
should i have known that 
i don't think it hurt me not knowing it 

that's 
that's that 
whatever they call it 
thirty three that's on the ballot 
yes we did just last night 
well personally i voted 
that the 
thirty three should pass i think they should 
the way i  
understood i'm they have ways of wording those things that you had to read it very carefully to know whether you should say yes or no on the thing 
i said yes because 
i 
uh 
uh 
analyzed it to say that they're 
something that was passed i think it one or two years ago 
that was  things to be done up around the polaris area like new roads and this and that 
and i want that repealed because i don't think we should be helping anybody else to do that and taking the money away from the other things 
columbus 
oh northland 
yes 
no 
uh i agree with everything he has said 
but uh  i'm 
a little more 
i don't know what the right word is to say 
but 
sometimes i think politics are little bit dirty 
and i think that sometimes they don't even count all the votes or something and sometimes that they  want it to go through bad enough 
even though the majority voted 
not for it 
i mean 
even though the majority doesn't want that to happen 
that somehow or other they will count it so it did 
or they will well you know 
right 
right 
not like i am 
oh yes 
oh yes i did vote 
absentee 
a number of years ago when we were traveling a lot and everything else i uh we did 
absentee voting 
and i've just kept it up 
now one year i forgot to send it in so i went to the polls 
i don't know 
absentee 
yeah 

all the politicians 
all right take the governor or take the president of the united states 
they can want something this way but then they've got the senate and all these other committees down below them that if they overrule him what good does he you know what can he do really 
so i mean no matter what he promises and you're  voting him in there for what he's promising you 
but if he can't succeed in getting these other guys to back him up 
there they went 
you're from where 
oh 
it can get aggravating and when you get to be older you know 
of those issues 
can be very aggravating 
no i 
i don't know i think 
i really don't know i think 
in today's world 
what they call the nineties 
that 
uh it's just like everything is changed like 
when i grew up 
we kids that grew up when we grew up and everything else we had standards and there were certain things we did or didn't do 
and then it came along that 
when our kids grew up 
then there was 
so many things that changed and some i think 
one thing like it stands out and this has nothing do with politics but it's an example 
in 
in school they changed the way they were doing their mathematics 
i couldn't even help my kids with their mathematics sometimes and i took geometry and algebra 
you'd think 
yet i used to get straight as in algebra and when i got to geometry i thought why am i taking this so that wasn't so good but still 
the way they were teaching it 
now 
and they're reteaching it entirely different now 
and i think linda explained it how they were doing it with math here and said she couldn't even help him 
and 
so you know it's in the same way with politics 
it  
people i guess change over the years their outlook on life changes or their 
whatever 
changes 
and  think it is 
to me it's getting worse but then my mother 
so i think it's just a sign of the times i don't know what it is 
i answered it 
yeah 
as he was speaking and  as he started to speak i realized too another thing that i really feel has a tremendous impression on how we 
as people are doing here 
but how the politicians are is because 
the world 
in essence is getting smaller because the communication has gotten better 
and all these other countries and us are just like all one country anymore or something 
i think that's had a tremendous influence also on our politics and on we as a people 
yeah and and immigration from different countries and those people come in and they've got their input 
and i think that it's just a 
mixture of everything 
oh i think that's good 
well i'm saying on the whole world 
and everybody is so busy now with all the things that they have to do even me 
i think that maybe he's found it the same way but maybe 
as i have 
i thought when i retired i was gonna get this done and this done and this done 
i wonder now how i went to work and still got 
and i'm sure i'm doing it just as fast because over and over again people say 
i've never seen anybody with as much energy 
you're always doing something 
but and 
i think it's just that we don't have the time 
to  with our neighbors 
like 
years ago you knew everybody in in town 
well the town 
up in was summit station and i don't know if you know that old teeny weeny town or not but 
it's 
a very big town 
and 
everybody knew everybody 
and anymore 
you're lucky if you know your neighbors because everybody's so busy doing their own thing 
but as a world 
i think that 
everyone has become closer because 
of the communication that if you don't really actually speak to the people you're hearing about are on tv or 
radio or 
via telephone or whatever 
sometimes i think it's been a very bad influence on certain aspects of life on others i think it's been very good because at least it lets us know what's going on in the rest of the world 
and if it weren't for that some of the things we wouldn't know 
and i think that as you increase your knowledge you're far better 
to stay in this little hole over here and 
this is all i wanna know about 
the bad place is the television things that they have on the programs they have on and i think that that's had a lot to do with changing our younger generation and the way they think the way they act what their morals are 
and i think that's why they're having more shootings in schools 
and uh  
uh the programs are terrible i think that they need to really redo them 
there's too much profanity there's too much sex 
there's too much just do what i want i gotta do my own thing 
that's where the 
when 
i want to do my own thing started he says with the women's feminist 
and it probably did 
and it probably did have something to do with it 
uh because after all so much speaking up and they want 
to do things my 
bing crosby who was it no um 
yeah  that that's right frank sinatra 
is the one who's singing duh i will do it i did it my way 
and 
uh 
really i think the biggest problem in the world today i want to do it my way and you can't oh you gotta cooperate with the other person 
think what 
hm 
hm 
well but 
doesn't that get back more or less to the thing about everybody being me 
me me now and therefore they really don't so much care about where they came from and what they are and who they are 
that's right 
in other words there's so much me anymore instead of 
us and we 
and that's i think that's really a major problem and i think there's a lot of problem with the young kids today do it my way or 
they haul off and hit them or 

you know 
shoot them 
if it were possible i think that a lot of parents are trying to raise them what they think is the best right now and that's another problem 
it seemed like the way the 
world has come up and everything else 
the way the cost of living has increased 
it almost takes two parents in that home if you wanna 
really live a half way decent life and be able to do some of the extra things 
no one wants to live and only have to be able to just use like you 
the necessities 
and if it's not a necessity i will have to forfeit it right now 
while a lot of them want the necessities they also want some of the extras 
and in order to do that both have to work well consequently who's really raising the kids 
if they're lucky they've got a loving grandparent 
ninety nine times out of a hundred i don't know if that's a good statistic 
it's 
the babysitters or you know these places 
it's not a babysitter it's a babysitter school or something like that 
and that's not the same 
loving 
cuddling 
atmosphere that it had when mom was home and able to watch the kids 
and i think that that's  of things they can change plus the fact that they change these stupid 
tv programs because that's a terrible influence a lot of kids 
it's taken over their life 
if it is not that now it's worse yet 
it's 
the kids are on the internet now that's even worse 
because now you can't even hear what they're getting into at least on tv you walk in see it and turn it off 
now you can go in i guess and see what they're on the internet 
sorry 
can't have the internet anymore 
but i think those are all really they can be good influences if they've got the right program 
and the right person they're talking to 
but too many times it's the other way around 
did i do with what 
i had three yeah they're all grown up and had kids of their own i have  in that age 
uh 
uh 
all right number one 
none of them had a 
the privileges of having a car where they could drive and go anywhere they wanted when they got out of school and they got a job and they bought the car they had their car 
they were not allowed to have my car and take it and run over to this kid's house or that kid's 
they had to walk 
and i knew where they went 
and uh that was it 
um 
the  
they didn't have the tv programs they have now they had more 
programs that were actually like um i can't think of them some of the names of them anymore 
oh lassie's one of them yeah along that line 
along the lassie line and uh 
uh leave it to beaver 
and programs like that 
they were good 
down home programs that taught good values to the children 
but  they put some of those stupid 
i can't even understand them 
some of the comedies that they supposedly have on with these funny characters and everything else they don't look like anybody we see walk around this earth why do they have them on there 
has 
has the extraterrestrial already landed 
that's right 
fatherly 
adoption is different 
i think though that when 
adoption is entirely different than when you can see but somebody else's sperm or somebody else's whatever 
uh because 
adoption means that 
i can't have any children 
or i see a child over here that needs help 
and here it is again you're reaching out to your friend your neighbor 
you're not just forgetting about him and let the welfare or somebody take care of him and let him go down the drain 
and i think that that's what adoption is  
and you're really accepting this responsibility and that's love 
and when you're trying and willing to have 
well some people probably argue about this but i'm sorry if god did not mean that i can conceive and have my own child 
why should i try to implant somebody else's inside of me and produce it 
i mean i would rather go out and see this other child that really  needs help and adopt that baby 
because 
you can see them 
and you can help them and you're already aware to a certain extent of what 
genes they might've inherited and what problems you might be getting sometimes you don't 
later on you will find out 
but it still 
you can go back 
and you can find the parent 
and i don't know whether they're gonna be able to trace these genes back and say you know later on if something happens to this child you're having 
and find out well what did they inherit over here 
but if you've adopted a child you can go back and you can find it out and help the child better 

i think it if god meant me   i think it's wrong for them to  using that   
introvertal 
fertilization i think they call it 
introvertal 
i can't even  say the thing what is it 
yeah 
get back to god 
get back to believing in god and the values that the family should have 
i don't know 
how's that connected 
well god didn't teach you to go out and shoot your neighbor and he didn't go out and tell you to steal from him and he didn't tell you to uh 
ignore him the rest your life he didn't tell you that they're down there bleeding  they don't 
walk and turn the other way 
i mean he taught you to help and be loving toward each other 
and it 
it's lacking in a lot of people today as i said it that's that old me me me me thing 
or i i i or however you 
i 
have really think that that's 
most of it 
and i don't know how people 
i got a letter the other day and i can't remember the name of the personality that was doing it but he's sending out these things about how you can sign up 
to take  write in and say don't have these kind of tv programs on anymore where they use the profanity where they use the drinking where they use the dope 
and uh where they use the vulgarity 
i understand this thing about 
him being a her or her being a him what  what is 
what word am i looking for right now that i'm 
uh 
um 
not  not cross dressing when they're 
when two men live together and two women live together what do you call it 
not  
gays 
is that the same thing 
i 
the gays 
gays homosexual and all those 
i don't know where the children ever picked up but i am sure that they weren't born that way because there've been a lot of them who have been married 
had kids and i know one 
and then when he got the divorce  don't know why he changed his mind and started to living with 
the uh with the guys 
he ended up dying 
he ended up dying  um 
what's that 
disease 
aids thank you 
from the aids virus that's going around 
when he was near dying what did he tell his mother 
i won't use the exact words because there was profanity in it but he said i really 
up my life 
didn't i mom 
and he's got three kids three grown kids right now 
so you see what 
made him change what influence in society do that 
i don't know how we find it but i think if more people  i don't think 
it was ever taught in the bible to do that was it 
and  i really don't think so 
and i don't  
you know hear it 
i'm not that 
well versed when it comes to the 
uh 
i do believe there's a god 
and i do believe in prayer and i do believe in guardian angels 
watching over you 
and i don't think you have to go to church to really believe all this because it's how you treat the other person that really counts 
and if i treat that person 
basically it boils down to treat  other person the way  would like to be treated 
i don't know  somehow or 
and if they  if everybody would just begin to feel that way 
and when they start to say something nasty would think 
would i want them to say that to  
would i want them to do that to  
and i think if you could teach your kids that 
and get back to teaching them things thing on those radio programs and tv programs instead of what they're showing right now 
i think the world would be a  place 
a lot better place 
and along with the politicians they stop saying now what's really best for the general public 
instead of well  think to make ourselves look great 
yeah 
status symbol 

that's right 
and right 
i was thinking of grandchildren 
and i know that in my case i will use a personal case 
i will use frank 
my older son 
uh with the ones i'm speaking of with the one the boys going on seventeen the one little girl just turned eleven the other one turned eight 
well they go to the one grandparent's house 
and she has a habit of paying them for the little jobs they do around the house 
so consequently when they come to my house 
they think they should get paid and i happen to be the person that believes that if you live in this house 
you contribute your share 
you clean up your room you help with the dishes you take your plates from the  table 
rinse them off and put them there by the sink 
you take turns doing the dishes if if mom or somebody's busy and can't do it 
you help and you do your share around the home and you don't do it because you're gonna get paid for it 
well yeah but daddy's the one that's supporting the household you know he's gotta pay for the all the utilities and  uh uh the finances and the food we bring in and everything else 
but everybody else has gotta help here 
to make the home 
and i think that that's one of the problem too many people think instead of just getting them to  help 
each other because 
we're supposed to help each other 
and this goes all right back to what he said you said beginning in school or kindergarten 
i think it begins from the time the baby is born 
and the mother takes time to sit down here and either nurse it or feed it a bottle and rock it and sing to it put it to bed 
and play with them and teach them things as they grow up 
teach them how to tie their shoes and take them off 
teach them how to do everything they're supposed to do 
and 
oh that reminds me of a joke i gotta tell this and maybe this is off the record but 
i read it in readers digest the other day and it said about 
this uh little uh  
kid the mother was trying to teach the child 
how to put the clothes away 
she said go put it in the hamper and the kid looked at it like his crib the hamper hamper 
well you know 
where uh where  and mom and everybody put our clothes when we uh when we take them off 
and the kid immediately took clothes and went and he threw them down beside of daddy's 

and getting back to the profanity and stuff that was another one was in the paper 
some of the parents 
are not 
leading the children right 
and it was about this mother and father was doing something all at once their little kid maybe six or seven or eight walked in there and said 
what the 
h you know four letter word 
is this 
for 
and the father stand and looks stunned and after the kid's 
out says to mother well where in the 
h did that child learn to talk like that 
so you see 
himself away 
away 
so you see it's the one 
it's the ones that are teaching the kids 
and it's 
it's all those things that i've mentioned before 
but i think that really it 
what can we do to change it 
i think as i said it 
basically everybody has to learn to think of the other person and what's good for everybody not 
just 
me 
me 
me 
i hope not some of these mongers that goes around and always predicts the worst things like everybody saying at the end 
two thousand happens don't go out and celebrate new years  the  world's gonna  well how's it gonna end 
you know 
and 
i hadn't heard that one 
well 
i did see on tv late news after you'd gone to bed last night i saw where there's another airplane went down 
as it took off from kennedy airport 
it was uh 
an egyptian airline wasn't it 
and it had come to new york kennedy airport 
flew all the way across the united states to california for some reason then it went back all the way over here 
and then it had just taken off and what were they not even a half an hour or whatever out in the ocean where 
out over the ocean and 
all at once the plane went 
whoom in thirty seconds or something i mean it was down from what was it thirty thousand feet or something 
they must have they had to have been dead before they reached the water because of with that sudden decline boy that'd make you pass out if nothing else would 
and they're now they're trying to  was it sabotage 
was there something wrong with the plane was it pilot error 
and so i don't know if if there's gonna be more 
sabotage stuff going on the way some of those countries fight over there in the other countries and try to get us involved i don't know 
i hope not i pray to god that something 
then all the good people are trying to say no god's going to come back and salvage the world and all the good people will be here and probably the bad people 
maybe he will take the good people and make it a better world for us and the rest of them will suddenly die 
well if it didn't say i always look back and look at this 
there were how many 
thousands 
maybe millions of years before christ 
and here we are two thousand years after christ what makes us think we aren't gonna live through this ten fifteen twenty 
fifty thousand years beyond 
i can't believe 
unless there's  
thing like us 
our planet 
colliding with another planet or something 
that would destroy everything 
yeah that could be right yeah 
yeah but you just hafta have something to go by and this is the closest thing that we have so just go with it you know i mean you can't go back and try to  
somebody was trying to rearrange the calendar one time weren't they 
well i think i'm trying to stay on to it maybe i'm deviating too much 
oh that's right 
well that's right now 
well a lot of it 
well i already think that's happening right now 
because i think that i don't know what the divorce 
statistics have been recently 
but i do 
see that more people who are getting married are staying married because those that would 
don't 
those that would've gotten a divorce 
they're not bothering to get married to begin with they're just living together and if they separate so what 
and 
i think that 

that and i imagine that's about half and half right now or maybe it's more on this side i don't know 
so i think that that really is  
uh in evolution at this time tell you the truth 
what's gonna cause the world to end 
i think what they really mean  
by that i hope what they mean by that is 
that 
it will 
end the way it's being 
run or the way it's being acted out today 
and that people will be more compassionate toward each other and just be 
happy and content 
and i i still think that that has something to do with everybody getting back to really believing there's a god believing that you should take the other person into consideration 
it might sound very  
but it's 
very  very hard thing to accomplish 
especially when you've gotten into this 
like he said me me me and i gotta have this and that status symbol stuff 
and really 
if we older people 
could get out there maybe and start making speeches somewhere and telling these kids 
because i know i myself in my own home i've been a collector now i 
take this back to the depression years 
when i didn't have anything and my father one time when he was out of work 
guess what 
i don't know what welfare agency it was but they brought us our christmas dinner and the first doll baby i ever had 
and i remember when i uh tried to wash the thing off that little doll was one of those that sort of melted in the water 
and when my mother said well if you don't know how to take care of any better than that i will never buy you another one and believe me she didn't 
and so when my sister and i graduated we each bought each other a doll baby and i got mine to this day cause i won't even let my daughter play 
you know 
yeah oh yeah 
and uh 
you know and i i'd always use it as a decoration on the bed 
and 
uh but i think that 
that is mm a lot of the main problem 
really 
those are the formative years of a child 
no i 
i do believe 
i do believe and i think maybe i will ask you because you're one of the younger generation 
haven't you  
as you have grown older 
haven't you looked back sometime and said boy mom was right about that dad was right about that 
i think the 
older a child gets 
and that includes us too now that we're our age because we're 
i'm almost as old as my mother was when she died i'm older than my father was when he died 
i do believe i see now where 
just living life it'd keep your eyes and ears open 
and your mind 
you gotta have your mind open to receive what your eyes and 
um 
you learn things 
that you cannot possibly learn in a book in school they help 
they help you to teach that you should always keep your mind open in school 
but 
there's a lot of things you're just not gonna learn except by actual experience and living life 
and i believe that that's a lot of it right there because i know i started to say a while ago and i don't think i finished it i myself have 
these wants 
getting only what i need versus all these little wants and desires 
because i grew up in the depression and didn't have these things 
consequently i've got a doll collection a teddy bear collection an angel collection 
record collection you wouldn't believe 
a whole 
one whole wall of my room with books and books in another room 
the books 
i'd started when the kids were little 
because 
they did 
read at home 
and that libraries were not near as easy to get to as they are nowadays 
and consequently i've kept the books and it's amazing but some of those grandchildren almost all of them that come over the house said they get bored they will go over to the book 
they will go over that bookcase and they will start looking for something to read 
so it is good to have it available for them 
in the home to a certain extent 
now however my one son's gone too far he's got one room's completely lined with books 
and a hallway part of  is books and i don't know whether the kids ever go and pick those up or not because they're always going to the library 
so you see it's what 
is taught at home 
that really count 
but we don't need all those material things and now i'm sitting back and thinking well 
which one of my kids which one of my grandchildren are gonna keep this or shall i have an auction and spend the money and 
you see what i mean 
you change 
your opinions change as you get older 
and you begin to look back 
i don't think i was ever a spendthrift to the point that i did things 
foolishly 
some things i did do foolish but i mean 
on a over all basis 
but i 
huh 
mmhmm 
usually she's looking for something to eat you know 
and walks away 
well i think sometimes that it's because the child has 
not ever been taught 
somehow or other 
or shown 
i've always been the kind of person to believe i never told my kids 
not to do something that i myself was doing 
examples smoking cigarettes or taking a drink of beer or taking a wine with my dinner saying no you're not old enough but i can 
now there are some things that the kids 
can't do at this age that somebody can at another age possibly like go out 
on a date 
for example 
well he's going out that party why can't i well he's already sixteen years old now wait till you're sixteen years old and you will be allowed to go to parties because by that time i will expect you be able you know know what to do 
uh but 
i mean i never did 
uh and i know 
well i won't give you any examples but anyway 
if 
if i told them they couldn't do it 
i would try 
swearing is one of my bad habits 
and i know that uh i would try 
very 
very hard 
i got taught one time that i better watch a little more carefully by my one little girl 
uh but anyway 
i would always 
and i would apologize if they did catch me doing something that i've been telling them no you cannot 
do 
i would apologize say mommy was bad and mommy did that i got soap in my mouth one 
well 
well um oh no 
i mean now if you want to hear the story it's funny well deviate just a teeny bit i was baking a pie 
and i was taking this pie out of the oven it was a cherry pie or an apple pie one those that can get juicy sometimes and i hadn't put any aluminum foil or anything underneath there to catch it 
and just as i started to get it out i spilled it 
and i said a bad word you know and just as i said that word leaning down here here's two little shoes 
and i just sit there for a minute before i took it out 
i take it on out 
well mommy said a bad word 
i guess that 
uh 
mommy has to have soap in her mouth doesn't she 
do i get to put soap ih your mouth mommy 
i said yep 
i said  you caught mommy saying a bad word and you'd have got soap in your mouth yep 
so i go in the bathroom now what i always always tell the kids was stick your tongue out and i just put a little bit of soap on the end of their tongue 
well now i've been  i've had false teeth since i was about thirty two needless to say i had false teeth when this kid did 
go in the bathroom i sit down on that toilet stool and i sit there 
i stick out my tongue 
she takes that cake of soap she doesn't rub my tongue she 
twists it 
it got on my teeth and it took me almost 
two weeks to get that soap taste off my teeth 
no matter how i scrubbed 
needless to say 
if i'd begin to get impatient after that 
and i'm ready to say something 
i'm look 
right 
same way with kids 
if you have a penalty for them they will learn their lesson 
but 
it's 
also the parent that has to set the example 
and there's too many older folks right now i don't think 
because of 
two people have to work outside the house they get home they're aggravated they're upset somebody else have had their kids all day 
and it's it's 
it's terrible that 
the 
situations got that way 
but i do feel that the older people including our government 
people and everybody that's at the top 
has to set the example 
and stick with it 
uhhum 
yeah 

child abuse 
it hurt 
oh yeah 
oh yeah 
i really think civil rights 
have gone too far 
because for every rule that says 
you cannot do this to the other person 
there's another rule 
says that  that's okay if that other person does it to you 
i mean 
my mother used to say for every law that was written 
there's another law written over here that will actually nullify that one 
and i and actually as i've grown older i've found that and it's  it's worse in today's world as i said as the  rights  
and you have a right to this and you have a right to that 
it's terrible 
murderers get away with murder now by that plea bargain that plea bargain i think is the most 
thing that ever was passed 
i don't think there should be any plea bargains 
oh but 
there are people who get 
murdered eh and sent to  chair 
electric chair i still believe in it 
because if someone is  and i don't believe that they should have ten years of uh 
what do they call that  legal process where they can 
appeals 
thank you that's it 
i don't think that you should have that 
either one appeal or two should be the limit 
if they're still found guilty 
sorry 
and if an innocent person hasn't been able to prove he's innocent 
that's just one of those freaky things that happens 
because sometimes innocent people do pay the penalty for someone else that's guilty that's 
corrupt enough in his mind that he knows how to get away with it and get somebody else take his blame 
but i don't think there's that many 
innocent people that 
ever went to the electric chair that they should actually have nullified that 
because what right does that person have to live 
tv just about two or three days ago and here's this guy down in the south end and as he's walked out 
handcuffs behind him and they're putting him in the cruiser 
welp i did to her exactly what i said i's gonna do i's 
watch her draw her last breath 
he killed her 
now he's gonna go and probably maybe a plea bargain 
and he will get off with it because maybe he was abused as a child and that had something do with the way he was thinking 
what happened to this woman because of it 
i'm sorry let him pay the penalty 
and if more people paid the penalty 
there would be more people thinking 
three four times before they did the same thing and that would help i think to stop some of that 
uh plea bargained or 
or  or somebody or or or later they will claim that 
i was coerced to saying that as i walked out the door 
you know 
and 
it's a big lie 
that's right 
they just said they just asked it the wrong way 
or they didn't say it loud enough 
that you have the right to 
well i was never told i had the right 
see i never was told i could make the telephone call 
and if they can convince them 
and the poor police men can't 
i think really what they ought to start doing is taping 
everything that's said 
and taping it so it's so clear 
that there's no way that they can deny it 
and then yet they've got that thing allowed it's illegal civil rights you can't tape what i'm saying it's like we signed the paper for you 
then get them to 
get them to sign when they go in there 
you fully understand now what we're going to do 
and if boy if they say then they really make it so 
and ask them two or three times on tape that they understand this before they sign this even 
well then how could they say that they 
uh 
they've got to come up with new rules and they got to make the penalties stick 
uhhum 
yeah 
they have to get a larger police department to do that that's another thing the cities have grown so much that we do not have 
adequate 
protection i don't think anymore and they 

well yeah where would you send it 
if you could send it to one of the tv programs that have like uh oprah winfrey or someone get it 
all over the world and all over the united states or something so people really hear it  maybe it would might do some good if people begin to speak up 
you know what why don't they start some type of a television program with questions like this and what the people really think it would help to do instead of having things like oprah winfrey and 
who's those other couple guys that get on there ask the most stupid questions and 
yes you might make millions you could retire 
really 
well i dont 
uh no i do really believe 
that they if they would have something like that instead of some of the 
even those shows they're no good even for older people to watch they aggravate me sometimes and i turn them off for some of the stupid things they do 
that jerry who was it jerry springer or jerry somebody that's on there and he has 
jerry springer 
some of the things he has on there some of the people i think they ought to arrest him for 
show them on tv 
what was he like down there 
jerry  i mean 
jerry springer 
well and when he first started out 
but when  he first started out i liked him 
he had on sensible things  to almost something what we're talking about now i think sometimes 
but he 
in order to keep up with the oh 
uh 
i can't remember all the names of the shows i don't watch them but i'm  oprah's one of them 
and all those other people that's just like her 
and a of course they get into the smut and everything else and what they've done and all that malarkey 
and i think he decided he had to do the same thing on his program in order for him to keep his ratings up so you know  and see that's what you mean 
by getting into what this person does over here and that's another thing we need to teach our kids 
because john doe jane doe is doing it does not mean that is right 
have the courage to be yourself and say 
some people might think you're terrible sometimes but 
some of the ordinary people 
uh excuse me we're in  
we are both in the genealogy on our respective families and you can find a lot out about your family when you start doing that 
in fact 
you and me forgot one that i found i had don't you remember we were over in that there library in pennsylvania and i 
he came back and i was sitting there laughing and i'm trying not to laugh out loud and he said what's so funny 
of 
all the names i'm looking for from all my family he's finding things for his 
found one of them 
way back in what was it sixteen seventy or something 
this boatload of people come over from england 
and they were the ones that had been deported from england 
because they had done something against the government or something like you know stolen or were the thief or something 
and i said would you believe the only person i can find in my family is nothing but a 
convict 
i don't know why he 
anything like that but that's the ship he was on 
well i know but you know  it struck me as funny at the time because thats the way it was worded 
uh but if you love the if you love someone you want them to do what's right and you want them to learn and if that's the punishment they have to pay for something they did wrong 
you still love them but you're loving other people also 
in other words you're not letting the fact this is my child so he can get away with murder but this one over here i'm not gonna let get away with it 
no i'm sorry if my child committed something 
that this other one would have had to pay for i'm sorry you've done that dear but and i love you dearly but 
i try to teach you differently i don't know where you went wrong i don't know what i did wrong whatever but 
you gotta pay the penalty 
i mean you have to draw the line somewhere 
uh but now you said family yes 
i think the reason and that at our age we look back 
everyone was born 
and everyone was loved by a father and by a 
when they were little 
and how their formative years are and the education 
the 
um 
the way they were 
uh taught as they were growing up 
does help them to become what that president is what that  any politician is 
any minister or anybody else 
it 
the way you are raised i firmly believe and the 
things you were taught does have an impact on what you do the rest of your life and i know a lot of the things that i've done in my life 
are definitely based on what i saw happen back here 
you know 
and i think that  
it bears on everybody so that's why it really begins with the family 
does that make sense 
oh i'm sorry yes if you're uh besides our time's probably up i don't know 
did you get to tape everything i don't care if it's over time or not as long 
okay 

that's number  
i have a very general uh opposition to this kind of thing 
uh no matter where it is anymore 
uh my being seventy six years of age has a major bearing 
because i see 
the uh  total destruction of our center cities 
uh and i say when i speak of center cities i don't necessarily mean just 
cities the size of columbus    is the largest one in the state of ohio now 
but i'm talking places like 
washington courthouse which maybe have fifteen thousand 
or um 
uh wadsworth which maybe have eighteen thousand 
uh this kinds of thing is being developed on the peripheral of the cities is just totally destroying those 
and 
a consequence i feel it's breaking our society down to the point where 
we don't 
don't know our neighbors at all anymore 
the 
uh it's quite common anymore that if you go three houses down 
you have no idea who those folks are how they feel 
what they might do for you or you can do for them 
uh 
and that all applies to the polaris question as i see it 
and i think also that uh  it's a it's a very very major financial 
uh gain for the developers who are doing that and it's going to 
therefore harm 
uh the many many areas 
affected 
such as 
north 
north north north north 
uh north what 
northland  yeah northland i can't 
okay 
do i think they will 
oh yes i think they definitely will i think there's so much heavy 
uh political and financial 
well i'm gonna reverse that statement uh there's so much heavy 
financial 
influence upon the political 
uh influence that uh it it's almost a forgone conclusion 
and if it doesn't occur this 
within this year 
and uh there may be another vote in another year or next a next election 
but i think that in fact it will go 
i didn't quite   hear you 
a little but not not nearly like she is 
when you're fifty five or 
or is it sixty two whatever age there's that age 
limitation and or you 
based upon age or disability or being out of town 
uh you're allowed 
so but routinely we've  
done the out 
i mean done the uh 
absentee 
over the years 
no going back to basic politicians i i i think we have  
uh i think the vast majority 
uh 
are truly 
good 
honest people 
they try to mean well 
i'm 
i'm concerned always 
that uh people who go into politics are in fine shape when they start 
but the tremendous influences are brought to bear 
that they never 
had had the opportunity to comprehend 
before they got there 
they're just overwhelmed 
it it and i don't necessarily think it's a 
it's a 
a dishonesty 
it's like a tidal wave they get caught up and they can't resist the direction that's being put or they are being pushed 

uhhum 
i just had a uh  healthy vigorous 
conversation last night 
with a township trustee jersey township 
which is just over in uh licking county 
and uh 
this gentleman 
is 
three or four years of age and he's been the township trustee various times throughout his life 
and 
he 
is very very concerned because of the exploding 
back up 
he's 
a farmer has been a farmer 
all of his life he owns about a hundred and fifty acres adjacent to 
approximately a thousand which his son is  
mainly operating 
yet he goes out and works too 
uh helps out at  
at this age 
uh 
but he is concerned because they've just recently passed an ordinance within the county 
which allows 
developers to come in and 
already they are ready to take over a couple farms that are fairly close to him 
but it affects the whole township 
and one of the things that they 
left out as he put it 
one of the ordinances that he  pushed and pushed and pushed 
he wanted 
a specific 
part of that 
ordinance to say 
every so many 
people that move in to this area 
you must provide for 
a school 
and he said 
of  and then he said they didn't do it 
and he said i push and push and he said 
i didn't know all the influence was on 
on the side to get more houses get more houses because it was gonna produce more taxes 
but  
he kept saying well what do you want these taxes for if you're not gonna provide for schools 
so he was very concerned about that 
so here was a case in my  opinion 
a very very honest uh politician 
but he was 
also being  away  what he 
felt was an honest approach 
uhhuh 
let me focus on  you're question i'm not  that 
i 
that she was answering what i thought  
but um 
i appreciate your opinions 
but were you asking 
did you have we seen a change in the politicians 
and through our lifetime was that particularly your point 
yeah 
okay 
okay 
i think it has changed drastically and i think it is changing and i think it will 
also be changing in the future 
uh 
going all the way back uh finances uh  were not a consideration in the in oh i'd say probably my first thirty maybe even forty years 
there was some there was influence 
but i think the influence was not financial 
it was influence from 
the person who could get up here and talk with a group of people 
and sway them with his 
and i want to use the word opinion but i know that's not right 
it 
he swayed them with 
a position that he had developed 
now that's not necessarily his opinion 
so i'm trying to make a point there 
he would sway them based upon 
the 
influences that he had  
had  
uh 
uh various people within his community or 
whether 
whether you're talking about a township or a county state whatever 
it may be 
and yes 
uh uh then 
slowly 
then i think the finances came into play 
and finances have come to a  
horrible 
horrible situation as of today and i will leave out this 
the last two years it 
because it's because 
it's rather  
specific right now 
but uh going back to two years or four years ago 
finances were still a very very heavy consideration 
and 
not not just on the uh national level 
but i'm seeing it even on local levels 
i know within the immediate community there are people out there 
uh 
hey come on we will go to dinner we will go do this and we will do this and do this just uh just barely barely breaking 
the barrier but not breaking the law 
uh 
so yes 
very definitely 
progressively 
has changed 
which one of them 
old blue eyes that's right 
uhhuh 
well 
don't know that that's a 
cause uh a it 
they as a  uh 
and this was kind of a happenstance it  
this occurred 
as a result of a very major world war 
uh so 
in  
in terms of them causing it 
it was there was a happenstance and 
and part of this mass communication we're talking about 
uh 
began with them 
and yes they are a major influence because we were talking about numbers and you're talking about uh 
a  a greater 
inter communication 
i'd like to go back one step 
where we're talking about 
when i made mention that three doors down you don't even know who that individual is and i want to stick with that 
uh i think that's  
as an 
individual communication we are nearing zero 
in terms of global mass communication to everybody  
inner 
personal communications that's the key in my opinion 
personal versus inner personal communications 
and 
it's zero over here and we're almost a hundred percent over here 
but when we're in this inner personal or global or massive whichever term is the most appropriate 
um 
john doe who speak here 
he hasn't the faintest idea who jane doe is over here 
on the personal 
it used to be 
that yeah you knew who this person  over here that's jane doe that lives in that third house 
and she married henry jackson don't you remember old henry 
well henry was the guy that lived way over there 
on the other side of town 
mass communications as it is today 
they haven't the faintest idea of where jane came from or where henry jackson or where 
old  
whoever 
so 
i think uh the  i  i  you  need to distinguish between the personal inner personal 
relationship 
so maybe i digress too far there 
or who the next door neighbor is 

lassie 
i think i could summarize  
uh just with a few words of what you're meaning to say i  
may be wrong 
but i think you're really meaning to say we must get back 
to the family 
there must be two parents 
and they must  
recognize their children and 
do like 
you have just discussed 
uh do with them the  
and 
because today we are just drifting and drifting and drifting we uh 
fifty percent of uh everyone who marries has divorced within a matter of about five years as i 
understand the statistics today 
and uh unfortunately it's still increasing but there is a strong feeling that maybe this is going to slowly reverse or at least decrease not reverse probably 
um 
once again we are talking about communications too uh and the communications can be ill and they can be great 
uh as she's touched upon 
uh oh but i feel that pendulum has to swing back from 
the non family we're headed toward or have been headed toward 
and get back to a  very basic family orientation 
it's 
abhorrent when i 
hear  uh 
uh 
oh was it seven ladies who were quote 
beautiful ladies are now willing to sell   sperm uh well that's not their sperm well whatever that is they sell 
uh 
for ten thousand dollars apiece and to be implanted in the other 
so that they can produce  uh a quote beautiful child 
well a beautiful child uh 
and if  talking about just the physical features 
is meaningless 
it's what 
is embodied in that body that's 
can be beautiful 
instead of just the physical features that you look at 
and that to me is abhorrent such a such an  
and that 
indeed is gonna take away from family i  
in my way of 
thinking i can't imagine 
that i would uh 
have my wife producing 
somebody else's child over 
and i'm going to have 
the same 
thank you that's  fatherly love fatherly value fatherly instincts 
toward or with that child 
yes to but that uh 
more that has primarily because of necessity 
uh more often than not uh 
uh maybe even today it's less than that 
because it's a  
because of a loss of a parent  or inability of a  
uh or parents 
uh being able  handle those children 
so 
yes  those things do exist and they will always have some 
but that's a very small percentage though scott 

that's about right that's about right 
think it's   
cross dressing uhhuh or cross personality 
homosexual 
oh okay gay whatever term 
aids 
well i see 
i'm gonna have to fall way back and show my age again as most people would say 
uh 
i  
i would really like to see  to happen but i also know that it most  
it will never happen within the next three or four generations 
but i  
i'm of a  who still believes that the lady has a place in her home 
and i do not believe that we need 
a man and wife out working and making 
incomes as 
everyone in the united states today feels they must 
uh 
hazel hit upon it rather lightly a while ago and was talking about 
need versus uh luxuries 
i want i want i want 
well 
i uh my judgment is that we're spending today probably 
eighty percent 
of uh the income 
on things that they 
want 
and only twenty percent on what they need and that's all they need to spend on that need 
so therefore the  
pardon 
today's society does describe the need entirely differently than what i would 
talking 
talking to this gentleman last night we got back and we were comparing uh our  
uh uh early life 
uh we didn't even know what a nickel or a dime was uh those  that was unimportant and we also were talking about 
how uh 
how we uh went 
he was telling me a little bit about it and i said 
let me stop you paul i said paul  
what kind of shoes did you wear 
uh in the summer 
he said we didn't wear any shoes 
aha 
and then i told him how we didn't either i came from a very large family 
uh mostly boys 
we would uh 
take our  shoes off as soon as the   as we could in the springtime 
we would 
uh store them in tallow in jars of tallow tallow is 
uh lamb lard if 
and that was a preservative 
and then when it became cold enough in september october maybe even as far as november this year it would've been november 
we would take those shoes out and depending upon whose foot 
fit those shoes those would the be the person who wore them 
it wouldn't be   
the one who had worn them in the spring 
cause he's growing in the meantime 
and uh and it may go to another another 
and i can remember we passed shoes down 
as many as four of we children 
now my dad also repaired shoes 
he repaired shoes he cut our hair 
well today that would be the most horrible thing is some of the kids that well i need me a pair 
of  um i don't know whether you want  uh advertising on here or not but it's not  
i i want a nike or i want a rocky or i want a guess 
uh 
those that's pure luxury no needs at all but uh 
today's society 

are 
as i  you were implying 
those are  two those people 
but they aren't 
uh 
so 
how do we 
correct some of this you've got to  i think we've got to cut out 
a lot of this luxury 
we've got to slowly bring quote that family back home 
uh 
and i don't necessarily say it has to be the woman versus the man who cares 
in today's work uh world far less agriculturally related 
uh we're far more in service orientation and manufacturing orientation 
uh so 
uh a man and uh 
uh 
a  or a   me  a woman can do 
most of the work that's being done outside of the home 
today versus what they 
could have done 
as agricultural people 
uh 
and so once again though that would  
people back to this 
central 
family 
make up 
this 
has to be 
communications communications as it's going uh that it's 
irreversible 
uh  i think it can be redirected in much in the manner she's speaking uh 
and uh 
and where does this start i think it has start back here in first grade 
i think parents must participate with teachers 
uh as we used to 
uh was just common uh you could walk in and sit down and uh watch the students or participate with participate and or 
assist 
uh well  
they have these  assistants 
but they're hired 
directed 
assistants they're not in there 
portraying or passing 
their 
their values of the community to the students 
uh so i think that's 
i  guess i   i will continue to come back to family 
to family almost everything has got to  come back to family 
bring that family back together 
and get them to communicate 
on that 
personal basis not that impersonal basis 
very very much so now  
twenty 
fifty years ago twenty five to fifty years ago we would call we would tag 
that description 
rather than corporation we would tag that as socialism 
well 
in the manner we  define socialism fifty years ago we are a very very socialistic government uh today we're  
no longer a  democratic government 
as defined back there then uh 
yeah we're still democratic according to our new definition of this 
developed over time 
uh but it's 
far more socialistic 
uh but 
uhhum 
yeah there's almost nobody anymore that's willing to do uh just uh miniscule things 
unless you're gonna get paid for it uh it's just always money money money money money money money money 
uh  
just uh 

uhhum 
uhhum 
oh we now run on the gregorian and or that sort of thing 
back to your question i think you were asking are 
yeah that's right when you're that was your question are we gonna have doom we're gonna have a catastrophe we gonna get this thing turned around before we have 
yes 
uh i think we will 
uh but i don't 
think we're ready to turn around yet i think we're still 
well this mass communication that she has alluded to three or four five times i  
uh it it is coming upon   rapidly 
i 
strongly predict 
that in just 
twenty years 
and possibly ten 
each and every one of us in the world are gonna be interconnected with one another 
but once again its an impersonal 
uh inner connection 
i can i will be able to contact you when you're over in paris and i will be over  in in 
ohio and out there on the farm 
and i am probably watching the geese swimming up and down the little lake 
and you're sitting over there in paris having a 
uh 
coffee something something 
yeah it 
well i i enjoy this 
but it it will be impersonal  because here you are   i'm  i can't face you i don't know whether you're really kidding me in what you're 
sitting there in the 
in  uh street 
but i really do think we're gonna be interconnected in that sense and uh um 
it it becomes  so much more 
impersonal i guess i'm very strong about the  term 
personal versus impersonal inner communications 
um 
the  that we've talked about i think will be a part of that ten and twenty years from now 
but i think we will have begun by that time to try to clean up the act if you will 
uh going back to the  political question i think that financial things who i  think we will start 
we will start slowing that down oh i think we will have less influence 
uh in the terms of finance and i don't think we will get back to abraham lincoln days 
but uh  if we can swing that pendulum back 
uh 
uh i think we 
i think we can and i think we will 
i think we can do the same thing with communications uh 
i think we can 
eliminate a  of the uh bad 
bad influences 
i do know that over time what we would have called bad back here is not necessarily bad here sort of like the definition of need 
versus luxury 
uh those definitions change the definition of socialism democracy that slowly have changed over these times 
well the same thing will true 
be true with those 
it's still functioning 
excuse me 
um 
and i think we will also 
slowly swing that pendulum on back to the 
to the family again 
there are those doomsayer from my point of view are saying that uh 
in in many years to come 
there won't be such a thing as a family 
uh it's just  
you go out here you meet a 
an opposite sex you  procreate and you go on your way she goes on her way 
and she's just as satisfied about going her way as you are going your way 
um  yes a lot of that is true 
but i think that 
uh i think that i don't think that's gonna ever happen i think we will turn that thing around 
i think this so called divorce rate program as i talked about awhile ago that 
uh 
every 
well fifty percent of the people who marry within five years 
are no longer together i think that will 
will change and that 
is a very significant thing i think in terms of getting back to the basic family 

now that was up to age eighteen to or there about to 
i think that the 
you said get back to the very beginning of the birth and up to kindergarten so forth  
i that's that's the family 
but uh i think that we in our educational program 
we really need to start teaching uh 
what i call the older values uh but but but good values i 
whether they're old or new but good values 
and i think we really need to have that established within our educational system 
uh starting in the elementary right on up to college i think there ought to be a number of college uh courses 
uh that that devoted exclusively for this so that those students can go back and 
uh 
assist in teaching 
but i think that many of the courses 
other courses ought to have 
elements within them that are teaching value family values 
um i could even so go so far as to saying chemistry or botany or psychology 
uh any one of those 
those are specialized subject 
and 
and 
but 
the i think there are elements that they can have within each one of those 
talking about family value family value 
uh and that will help them 
permeate the entire society 
and but it's got to start back here in the first and i think 
just uh  don't i just go back and copy cat something she said uh picking up that  picking up that child and cuddling it um 
and having 
having that baby touch your skin and uh 
and uh uh teaching 
how what love is 
uh 
uh you  don't necessarily teach love by words but it is just by the feel that child will begin to love you as the father or the mother or the brother little brother and the little sister 
all of those 
now you say 
teach that well my god didn't they know that when they first came into this classroom 
no not today 
not today 
i i dare say that uh the vast majority and i mean above fifty well above fifty percent when i say that i'm not being arbitrary 
um 
students in high school today 
probably haven't had their mother or their father 
truly 
hold them and hug them 
rather than just saying hi johnny 
bye 
see you tomorrow 
i mean 
hold them 
feel the warmth of the body 
uh 
hear the conversation quietly 
rather than uh hearing okay 
time to get out of here you know with a vigorous saying 
but with pleasant sort of remark 
these 
kind i can  i could write a whole book on that 
on this on answer your  
uh but it's these kinds of things are very elementary really 
they're very elementary i guess to 
our age group but maybe not so sure uh maybe the baby boomers that wouldn't be elementary at all 
uh 
going back to your question about the baby boomers 
i still think they were 
i don't think they're causing them but then i think it was a happenstance uh with that group 
with a massive group 
variant 

my answer to your question is has this eroded i'm gonna answer with the word using the word respect 
uh yes i feel that uh 
this has eroded over time 
uh there's not the respect for our 
elders i don't 
necessarily mean elders in terms of the uh chronological age but i'm talking in terms of generations 
the uh there's less respect for the father less respect for the mother less respect for the grandparents and the great grandparents 
uh i'm gonna give you a first hand example 
i just had a 
uh conversation with one of my granddaughters who is now twenty 
uh 
she will come over to my house grandpa's house 
and she will come in and she will flop down in a chair 
uh 
and she will do nothing in that household even if you suggest it 
uh i don't ever 
tell her 
uh do 
to do things 
and i've pointed out to her that whenever we went to visit grandpa 
or great grandfather 
uh 
if the if we saw weeds out in the garden we went out and we hoed the garden if we if or the chicken house need to be cleaned uh 
and they hadn't gotten to it that day we went out and cleaned the chicken house we would say 
grandpa is it okay if we go out and clean your chicken house well course you knew very well it was gonna be okay 
but 
a matter of respect though you ask is it okay for us to do it 
and uh 
now with her 
uh 
i can have dishes out there in the sink uh that are left there for from breakfast maybe 
lunch and 
uh 
she she will walk out there and will say 
well grandpa how come your dishes aren't done and then she turns around walks away 
that's right you uh huh 
and and she may then go ahead and say 
well now sometimes she will ask and sometimes she doesn't but lets assume she did she will ask 
is it alright if i have some of this 
she goes ahead and gets the dishes out so forth 
she puts them right in there in that sink uh with those other dishes 
makes no efforts to clean them 
and 
i 
i 
i've seen this in many many many incidents but i'm giving you this is very first hand i know this 
and i strongly suspect that this is a typical typical thing in our society today 
so yes in my opinion definitely it's eroding i know you took a little different approach in answering the question 
uh 
from 
over the time that that 
this kind of thing is eroding based upon the word respect 
she just used the word penalty 
penalty has  of different definitions each individual has a mental picture what the word penalty means 
based upon their own experiences 
all i wanna take just 
and it say it 
penalty in a very general sort of way 
whatever your extreme is to the right or to the left lets come back to about the middle 
i'm concerned that we are getting away from penalties 
completely 
and i feel it's absolutely essential that we have penalties we have 
for everyone 
for everyone really across the board 
uh we we're getting away from penalty we're getting away from penalty 
uh 
uh so many people i just to give an example 
talking about adults 
i just read uh statistics the other day right here  columbus where 
uh it was an extremely high percent i can't quote the percentages 
of people who uh ignore uh yellow lights and and of consequence they are ending up going through red lights 
and there many many many accidents taking place 
uh 
i 
and we 
it used to be that you could place uh uh an a law enforcement officer the corner if it happened and he immediately he would uh 
penalize you by giving your ticket and you face the 
court as the case may be 
well now we have passed so many little ordinances and laws and change the 
enforcement policies and this kinds of things 
well the poor police officer he can't even do that any longer he's got 
if somebody uh runs through red light you almost have to hit somebody 
and then be accused for going through the red light 
he can't just arbitrarily be there because that's called 
i think the word harassment plays a part 
you are harassing that individual because you were standing there waiting for him 
to commit this problem 
when i 
let's just get away from that example you can talk about whether you did you were carrying 
uh 
i don't want to get in to the guns and knives and stuff in the school that's enough for 
heard about that but 
the same principle applies 
but i'm talking about just every day things uh that uh 
people who if you wanna talk  children primarily 
uh 
there is no penalty any more 
uh parents are scared to death uh to pick up one up and spank them 
um with their bare hands or 
or to make them stand in a corner because they considered 
and i'm going back to the word harassment child abuse and harassment 
of consequence um 
and a  uh and penalty can be a very very simple thing a mother can simply 
look at janie and say janie 
you should not do that 
and the stern expression or the expression on that face 
can be 
equally effective as the smack oh on the bottom 
oh with the bare hand or a switch or whatever it may be 
i know that my the most effective penalty for me was my mother 
uh would uh go out 
near a tree and she would break a twig uh off and she would smack me across the shoulder 
and yeah it left marks 
but  and sure it hurt i mean it would sting 
and i understood exactly what was meant and i think i grew up and i've ended up being i think a quite successful person i think my mother 
had uh 
uh thirteen of the fifteen children who lived uh all pretty doggone decent kids 
and none of us were injured none of us were hurt uh 
and that was a basic method of 
penalty 
it wasn't something that 
truly  injured 
uh 
now today however 
uh i suspect my mom could easily be  could have been charged with abuse in fact 
child abuse 
because it left a mark across my shoulder where that 
uh 
green  it's always a green switch because uh uh the  old ones they would break you didn't want them break 
yeah 
there was just something about that sting 
far better far more than a paddle paddle was kind of a whop and then was end up with a sting and it kind of got your attention 
and then you  
appeals appeals 
mmhmm 
i read and 
um hum 
there was an in depth story about that i think it was 
i 
was harper's magazine or what it was in a 
uh uh  significant magazine where they had uh made a study of the new york situation 
and 
the i found that quite interesting and very very impressive 
uh 
as a matter of fact 
whatever it was i remember 
sending it in to the uh city council uh oh of dayton i just addressed the 
city council of dayton and 
had 
highlighted a whole bunch of it and hoping that uh they would do something along that line 
um 
shoulda gone to columbus at the same time 
very interesting 
or just thousands is enough he didn't have to have millions 
i don't whether i've ever pointed out this 
this out to you but he happened to be one of my uh fellow students down at ohio university 
now how he happened to learn 
i didn't 
course he started out it he 
he 
i think the very first thing he was township trustee like 
paul was 
and then he also went and became the mayor of cincinnati and he was a very effective 
oh yeah he was a very very effective he was well liked 
there has been some serious consideration but no uh there were some a lot 
someone took up a petition and was urging to do it but he's decided 
he did not want to devote that much time away from his uh 
his  television program 
oh he he's quite a smart fellow really 
some of this 
conversation we've had here 
uh has been influenced within our family 
uh 
we have 
ministers we have doctors we have lawyers we have uh 
farmers we have uh 
uh what else 
we have  
professors yeah well well i'm as i mentioned a while ago i happen to have i'm a 
one of fifteen siblings 
the colonials 
yeah 
and he 
and had been deported 
well not in the immediate family going back like you did there i know there there's a  murderer in our family uh 
oh there have been horse thieves uh 
i'm going on back now i'm not thinking in terms of the current family but basically what i was talking about a while ago was current families 
somewhat current 
i was going then relate to 
a comment that she made about i believe in the electric chair i believe in uh capital punishment uh uh 
but that was one comment she was talking about but then 
on the 
very very opposite extreme 
uh 
extreme opposite 
we talk about 
the love of the child from the day of birth 
and this may seem to be 
contradictory 
and i'm not quite sure how to address that 
because in a in in some some people would say now wait a minute you're talking out of out both sides your mouth the expression is 
how can you say over here you must have the love of this child 
in your arms and 
and then over here you're saying you believe in capital 
punishment and electrocution 
of a murderer 
okay 
okay 
i was about to say now on the record or off the  

okay 
um hum 
where you from 
oh really 
hm 
okay well 
call me rachel and 
i'm twenty  
i've got a two year old son 
he's just had his birthday 
um the thirty first 
so 
and i live by myself in a house 
and i work um at  in the accounting department 
it's in the accounting department 
um west side off of  road 
yeah 
yeah 
yep 
yeah 
yeah 
i'm not married i'm single 
i'm from here columbus ohio yeah 
yep 
i graduated from brookhaven 
off of coral 
um by 
northland mall 
i  
well 
i hope they keep it 
i mean that 
is a neighborhood mall and 
i mean 
i don't think they should get rid of it 
for 
polaris thing 
but 
you know 
there's plenty of malls to go to  that's the case 
it's not a big deal to me to tell you the truth 
no actually i live 
i live closer 
i live east more 
but 
northland mall is where 
i do 
go shopping 
uhhum 
yeah  
all my family still lives around me 
pretty much yeah 
yeah 
yeah  actually his 
his dad's mother 
babysits 
yeah 
oh yeah 
yeah 
i don't think they get the attention they need 
but 
i don't think it's bad 
i don't think it's bad because he did go to a day care when he was little 
before his grandmother started watching him 
and um um 
i mean it  you know  you're got people you don't know watching your kid and that's kinda scary but 
you know 
you 
gotta check things out first before you put your kid anywhere 
yeah 
uh 
yeah for them to go to a  yeah make 
i would think 
he will for them to interact with the kids more yeah 
but  
where he goes there's he's got   cousins and stuff there with him so 
yeah he's not getting that i don't think he's getting that learning 
he's he's more his 
uh that's his grandmother you know watching him 
and 
you know 
i   that she would like 
do more of the learning things that the day cares do do you know 
but 
i guess 
yeah  
i you know get on her to make sure she sits down and reads with him 
you know 
because i do put when i get home with him i 
you know sit down do his a b c's one two threes but 
he loves to read books so i try to get her to do that  of just let them play all day and 
just you know 
nope 
she that's a grandmother she lets the kids pretty much 
you know 
yeah 
yeah 
no 
no 
well 
i mean 
as 
i mean like i was saying i 
he's at the ages where he needs to 
you know 
start learning things and she just does not do that i and that's probably the way she raised her kids 
but 
no we have totally different opinions about everything 
period 
because they're from 
um a different 
they're from the virgin islands 
yeah 
so they're like 
not american ways you know 
but 
yeah i 
in 
discipline she's not 
she's not as  as i am i don't 
i don't allow no hitting no you know 
and 
she kind of  
lets it get away she lets him be a little rough because he's a boy but 
i don't 
hm 
no 
they're all 
boys 
they're all boys there 
so 
when i pick him up from there  
out of hand 
a little bit and i've gotta 
get him back you know you're with mommy now you've got to behave 
settle down 
well i work 
i work part time 
kind of 
because 
uh 
i worked full time 
when he  
was uh 
you know one and i didn't uh i felt like 
um the babysitters or 
you know whoever saw him more than i did 
and that  because i love my son more then anything in the world and i 
felt like he needed me 
you know so i went down to part time 
i'm struggling more but 
i'd rather see my son have me 
you know 
around more than 
somebody else 
yep 
it is 
i know 
uhhum 
i know 
mmhmm 
no 
i feel funny that i'm 
i mean i wish i was married if i was married it would be 
so much simpler 
in life but 
you know it just just didn't work out 
you know i was  his father for like nine years since i was sixteen 
he just didn't grow up once we had him he didn't change like i changed and 
so 
well 
i grew up 
with 
just my mom there she had four kids and 
i was a very quiet and did very well in school 
you know my older sister was a different case she was a little badder but it it's you know 
as long as you have a good parent to 
you know 
i think that's 
really all that matters because my mom was my mother and father 
she  she did very well 
as much as she could 
you know 
we were poor but 
we managed 
no 
huh um 
yes i i 
i just don't  i'm not comfortable with another man being around my 
son like 
that so 
i mean if i dated that mean 
you know 
i'm  
taking it 
i just i don't know 
haven't felt i've went out a couple times but 
i won't let it get serious or 
you know no staying the night nothing like that 
goes on 
and i've got friends that do that and i  
i don't  i don't feel right i don't want to see my kid seeing all these different guys coming around and stuff that's no way huhuh 
uhhum 
yeah 
yep 
uh huh 
okay 
oh 
i just  
i matured i 
um 
didn't do stupid things i did that you know 
um 
i don't go out much like i used to i don't go out hardly ever if i go out you know it's just to get out 
for a minute 
you know 
might have a drink 
but i don't get 
i don't get drunk 
because i always go pick up my son usually 
before i go home 
um 
i just 
i don't know 
you know when  
i was  
a teenager 
because i'm  i had him when i was twenty one 
and 
i mean i just 
pretty much became a 
home body 
i'm a home body now 
i don't go out i don't 
take my kid places and drop him off 
he's with me all the time i don't run around the place we're at home 
when i come home from work he's at home with me we don't 
we 
he goes to bed at eight and i go to bed by ten and it's just 
you know it's just like 
yeah 
uhhum 
yeah 
yeah if it's a nice day on the weekends i 

you know we will go places you know 
um 
we went to the  
we go to the playground take my dog to the playground 
we will go shopping 
grocery shopping 
um 
yeah 
yeah 
i haven't taken him there yet 
see i 
i 
he's a he's just 
he's 
in his twos and i like 
he's got to be in a cart 
or something 
well because when i'm holding his hand and taking him he just tends to 
want to  
he's not calm and  he's  
a little 
you know 
um 
so like that's why we don't do nothing because when i take him to people's houses 
he i can't do that because he will get into everything and 
i um 
i get real stressed out about that i don't i don't 
so 
i'm like 
yeah i do that 
i i 
make him  you know time out 
well now 
for 
two minutes 
when he was one just for one minute my mother taught me that 
um i don't  
i don't stand him in the corner 
or anything like that i do smack his hands 
um 
because he 
he likes 
he went through this hitting spell where he liked to hit 
people 
and i smack his hands for that 
and 
i try not to yell but it's 
not to yell i try to talk to him 
talk to him like you know this   be nice dan 
um 
yeah 
well yeah 
when he was 
i don't remember how many months it went on for like two months where he just cried it might have been colic or whatever but he  cried 
and 
yep 
i 
no 
uhhum 
know 
well you 
when you become a mother you tend to ignore things too 
so i guess 
i mean 
that went well that was really really hard for me i i would uh call all my family members i had family members coming over to try to 
figure out what this child needed but 
i don't know 
i couldn't tell you what he went through 
with that crying spell but he did go  
where he just did not quit crying 
but eventually it went away i just 
i just because i would get stressed out and start crying and go crazy 
you know 
and 
my mother was always there for me i would just call my mom like 
hey what can i do 
and she just like calm down rachel just calm down and 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
no 
uhhum 
well i work in the accounting department i'm a accounting assistant 
so 
i pretty much 
um 
it's not stressful at  
uh 
i 
it's really easy it's not 
challenging 
hardly at all 
which i 
you know 
it's actually my family's business so 
um 
i started working there to help them out 
but 
you know 
as i'm 
been working there for a while i  
want to move up 
you know 
so 
i mean i'm all for anything i could 
do the sales i could do you know 
the purchasing i can do 
i i pretty much can do anything that will be 
i can be taught to do 
no 
not at this job no 
i did have a job like that when i worked full time 
i was the receptionist 
and that was very stressful 
not not really much of the um 
answering the phones and stuff it was more of the um 
my 
um 
employer 
and my employees that i worked with 
it it was just that pretty much 
i worked with 
um adults that act like we were in high school and 
it was groupie 
you know 
and i'm not like that i try to get along with everybody and 
and it was just i never ended up fitting in with everybody and 
just things were gossip and 
i don't go for that 
and 
i ended up quitting that job and 
i felt like i 
you know 
should have stuck in there 
but i i couldn't deal with it anymore 
i mean i'd go home 
you know want to cry 
i mean 
it's just 
these were all adults 
older than me 
and it 
it was just  
it was really silly 
yeah i mean 
it it was just 
yeah talking about me 
and i would hear it from  it was just really childish 
and i would just hear things 
it is it was very much high school 
and i 
worked there a year 
and 
i just couldn't deal with it no more 
i couldn't deal with not never seeing my kid because i did work five days a weeks 
and then every third saturday i worked also 
which i made good money 
and i  need to make 
money again 
but 
i'm happier you know 
yes i will go back to full time 
most definitely when he's in school 
um 
if i could find something part time that pays 
more 
that's what i'm looking for to do 
but 
full time i wouldn't  definitely go back when he's in school 
that's how i would like  to be 
uh 
i've thought about that it's sad i'm 
i've 
i mean 
that's why i haven't went to college or anything 
because there was nothing 
my mind 
is set on that i want to do in life i just 
want to be rich 
i mean you know i have little thoughts of like i like  design um 
maybe a designer but 
you know 
like 
i went to a 
i i was in 
police 
i  
uh law enforcement 
i  went  went there for career center 
in high school 
and that was something 
that was exciting for me but that's totally out of the question for me now 
because i have a kid and there's no way i would do that 
yeah 
and yeah 
and i wouldn't do that 
i if i was you know had no children and 
maybe 
it was a law enforcement career center and 
i mean 
no 
it was during school 
um 
you'd go there 
you went there for two years your junior and senior year 
and 
um like your junior you'd go in the morning and your senior you'd go in the afternoon but it 
took up 
pretty much your whole day half of your day actually 
you're at the career center 
and then you go 
well law enforcement you'd start out and you'd do exercises for like two hours 
so i was like 
in shape 
very well 
i was in very good shape 
disciplined i would be screamed at 
made get jumped on the floor to do pushups i mean 
it was 
it was 
it was just like that i'm telling you it was and we would see  
you know they would 
put things on the  
on the screen for us to watch 
i  
i mean i learned a lot of stuff it was very 
a very good experience i went through 
very good 
yeah there were some of them didn't end up 
dropping out 
yeah 
probably 
yeah 
well i think a few of them have 
um 
i don't know because i haven't got 
kept in contact with them i think 
i know of a couple that have 
went on 
but i'm not sure about the rest 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
uhhum 
i picked um legal secretary also 
but i chose law enforcement over that because i got accepted to that too 
yeah 
i had a cousin that 
went on  she  she was in school for that 
and 
um 
as you could tell i like to do office work i 
i 
i guess i like to do 
but 
and i probably 
i don't know 
yeah 
uhhum 
uhhum 
oh 

uhhum 
right 
well 
yeah 
to tell you truth the school i went to sucked it i mean 
yeah it was very hard for me to stay in school 
i could have easily quit 
like that because the teachers didn't 
i went to a columbus public school and 
it they didn't care 
i mean i  
i went through elementary and middle school with straight a's and b's then got there and i was on c's 
to d's you know and it just was really 
the teachers didn't care 
you know 
if you learned you learned if you don't you don't if you don't come to school you don't they don't care 
that was how my school was 
so i don't 
there  i don't 
there was nothing there that 
really i can remember that 
did anything 
good for me i mean i think middle school 
taught me a lot more than high school 
i mean i i  
was very good in math 
um 
very good in math 
i mean i was i did pretty good in all of the subjects 
yeah 
home ec 
i'm 
yeah i'm sure that was useful to 
people that didn't cook or do anything 
it showed them how to turn a oven on or 
well no actually my mom didn't she was a very bad cook 
so she 
so i probably did learn a little bit because i 
i 
she still  she's 
lives with a man now and he does all the cooking still 
so 
i've  i've learned everything on my own upon 
cooking and stuff like that 
which i  
love to cook 
uhhum 
well i i'm a meat eater so i make a lot of  
you know pork chops steaks and 
you know 
beef stew 
he likes meat too 
yeah he  he loves some  and 
he loves chicken that's like his favorite food 
but 
yeah he  
he is a picky eater 
which he's  
yep he 
he doesn't like everything 
yep pork chops and macaroni and cheese he will eat that 
it's 
yeah 
yeah 
um 
i took a class for word  
word word processing one and two 
i took those and 
um 
tell you the truth i can't remember 
if they taught me how to balance a check book out 
i don't remember that at all 
i know how to  i know how to do it but i'm not sure who taught me how to do it 
yeah 
yep 
um 
yeah uh my brother didn't know what the heck to do with a check book 
yeah 
hum 
yeah i think so 
i think in high school there was 
or maybe that was for the pregnant girls that were in our high school 
because there were pregnant 
my high school 
uhhum 
there was pregnant girls in middle school 
uhhum 
it's around morse road 
yeah 
uhhum 
yeah 
no it was 
it was more black than white 
tell you truth 
or it might have been even but now it's more black than white definitely now 
because i  i live in a neighborhood where it's  it's mostly black than white and that's where i've always lived my whole life 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
yep 
um 
i don't know if you could say that 
there were a lot of problems i mean i even had problems 
like on the school bus and stuff you know 
but i had black  so 
uh 
i didn't have much 
you know much problems 
yeah there  
there were both there were  
there were um 
white skinheads at our school 
you know that 
were racist against me for hanging around black people 
um 
i didn't really have 
uh 
i guess 
i there i'm sure there was 
black people that were racist too 
but i didn't 
you know 
not in school i didn't have problems really 
much in school with that 
well they will suspend you 
yeah 
or put you in peek or something you know if there's any problems between students 
i don't think they 
that they never 
would sit down with the students and have them talk it out 
you know they might send them to peek or something 
oh 
i know what did it mean 
well it's you 
instead of going to your classroom you go into a room 
where 
you have you sit 
and the teacher gives you all your work for the day 
and you can't talk or anything 
yeah 
boring 
very boring 
uhhum 
uhhum 
yeah 
yeah 
well they were none of my friends that were pregnant 
and i'm not sure they you know 
i just remember couple girls that were pregnant i don't 
i weren't wasn't 
friends with them 
and i'm not sure about 
who their boyfriends were or anything like that 
no i don't think they did 
uhhum 
uhhum 
yeah 
well maybe i i 
you know uh 
because i was 
you know i was fooling around 
too when i got in ninth grade 
and 
i don't know i didn't 
wear any condoms or do anything like that 
and i just am very lucky for never getting pregnant 
no 
uhhum 
what  really um 
when aids  i had a 
a  
one of my best friend's brother had died of it 
and that 
and that uh really 
after that 
i like  
you know was like i have to wear a condom because i was scared to  death to get aids 
you know so i did wear condoms you know 
probably after a few years 
of having sex without condoms but 
but it wasn't the worry about getting pregnant it was the worry about getting aids 
uhhum 
because  i don't know it just was like if i get pregnant i get pregnant that you don't know 
of what you really have to go through of having a baby 
you know 
because i guess i really didn't care if 
hey if i got pregnant i got pregnant it didn't 
it didn't really 
you know register in my mind that 
this will  you know not ruin but it was it will change your whole life 
yeah 
uhhum 
yeah 
yeah 
i got on birth control probably when i was like 
sixteen or seventeen 
but still i didn't take the pills all the time and 
you know 
that wasn't very good 
well i would 
i would sit down and talk to her like you know if you want to have sex if you really want to have sex 
you should 
get on some kind of birth control 
and  suggest the shot the  the depoprovera because that's what i'm on now 
and that way you don't miss any  that lasts for three months you know 
and 
i that's what i would suggest for her you know 
well i  

you know talk to her but 
people don't 
when i was fourteen i didn't care what anybody told me 
i was gonna do it no matter what 
i really didn't because i felt like i was in love with these boys 
yeah 
yep 
yep 
to wear a condom 
i would mostly try to  scare him like 
you these girls could give you things that make your thing fall off or you know  i would try to scare him 
you know 
to make him 
know to wear a condom because you don't know what he's 
you know 
putting himself into 
uhhum 
right 
yeah 
yeah 
oh yeah 
yeah 
uhhum 
yep 
yeah 
i do because some boys might 
not wear them because they don't know how to put them on or 
i don't know 
i'm not sure because i'm not a boy maybe some boys uh 
would 
with it before they 
originally use it 
you know 
i'm not 
but 
i don't think it's 
it's encouraging them 
at all at the same time they should be telling them 
they shouldn't have sex till they're married 
you know but 
no they should talk about i think they should talk about that too 
um 
i never  i never did it and i 
you know wish i could have waited till i was married but 
i  
you know you're going through that 
whatever you go through when you're a teenager so you're like so what 
well most kids i'm not 
you know some people  some kids still do that but 
i think i yes i do think they should put that 
in it also that 
well i should tell them that they should love themselves the  the girls should wear 
both of them should love their bodies and not 
you know give it to a boy that's you know falling all over you and you're 
you feel all good and this and that you should respect yourself and love your body  
you know 
don't let don't give yourself to somebody just because you're feeling you're feeling good 
um 
and the boys i should 
the boys need to calm down 
um 
i don't 
i i mean 
uhhum 
yep 
but that's what they go through 
and i i i would just tell the boys you know respect these uh  these girls because they're gonna be women and 
you know try to wait 
you know 
you know if you love this girl if you think you love this girl wait till she 
go through high school together and stuff you know 
work but 
i don't 
i don't think they should 
i don't have any  
i don't 
you know if 
people are gay or 
you know 
that's their business but i don't think 
they 
that's not 
that's not how this 
world was 
they wasn't put 
you know 
it was a man and a woman 
to start out with 
i don't 
i don't think um they should encourage that 
you know maybe 
that's a hard 
um topic to for me to talk about because i'm 
i don't know 
because i'm sure there are 
gay boys 
that are  not knowing what's going on with themselves 
that are in school 
and 
and i 
i've never really 
understood i don't i never really understood if they were born like that or 
i  i've just never really understood that 
to tell you truth 
so i wouldn't 
you know i would just 
i  if i was a teacher i would just 
talk to 
talk to them and 
tell them  
to do whatever they feel 
i mean 
if they feel comfortable 
with 
being like that that's fine but 
i don't know i  i don't know if i would talk about the 
but maybe they should because there might be kids in school that are like that and they're like 
well what should i do 
yeah 
yep 
um 
yeah 
i mean i've got 
girls that are 
that have girlfriends and stuff 
and it doesn't bother me i 
i mean 
i'm not 
i like men and 
i i'm 
i'm a christian and i just believe that 
you know 
you should be 
you shouldn't god didn't put two women on this earth god didn't put two men they put a  man and a woman 
to be together 
to have kids 
i would just tell him that is just 
a feeling he's going through who he 
you know i i've went through that where you know you 
you look at a woman and you're 
you 
she's attractive to you you know 
but 
that's just something that's going through your mind and that i think that's like the devil getting into you 
because 
i would never 
sleep with a woman 
i would never do it even though 
i might be really would have been real drunk or you know or 
not drunk and just 
you know 
i would just tell him that's 
something he's going through and 
that's 
for him to do that 
that he 
you know he's a man 
and i would tell him god didn't put two men on this earth and 
if he would  choose to do that that 
i wouldn't hate him or disown him or anything like that 
it's all up to that human being 
if they want to change 
if they got their mind set on they don't 
want to be  
the 
you know other 
other sex i don't think they can change them 
you know that's all up to that person 
i think 
yeah if they want if they 
you know choose 
i'm  
sure there's 
you know women that are 
lesbians that 
have been with men also you know 
they've been with a man and 
then they've been with the woman now now they got a girlfriend so obviously 
you know and i feel like that was because they've they  had a attraction 
towards a woman so now they think they're lesbian 
i don't 
see  i don't 
that's why i think 
so i don't think that but if that's their choice 
that's their choice 
so i do think they could change 
nope 
huh um 
no 
they yeah well the grandmother 
she says she's a christian but i don't 
see it 
i mean a lot of people claim they're  
something and 
you know 
which i might not be a total christian because i don't do all the right things but i do believe in god i do believe i'm gonna go to heaven and i try not to 
you know 
sin too much and i do pray to him and i you know 
i just i don't go to church like i i used to go to church all when i was growing up and 
now i  you know i 
feel like you don't have to go to church to 
believe in god and all that 
you know 
i talk to him i talk to my grandparents that are in heaven and stuff you know 
that's just what i was raised as and 

um they just got different beliefs she believes  
i mean like 
one thing 
she believes all men will cheat 
yes 
she believes 
all men will cheat 
she believes no man will 
love you so much not to cheat 
and i don't believe that 
so i'm not with her son 
because  
i mean that's must be how she raised her kids 
you know and she's 
um and that's what i asked her she's got a husband i'm like so your husband you believe he cheats 
yeah 
and i don't believe that i think that's terrible 
i mean most men are dogs yeah 
but i do believe if 
you know when you're in love and you love somebody you will not  
you will not cheat on them 
yeah 
yeah 
uhhum 
oh that's so nice 
yep 
yeah 
yeah 
um i'm sure yeah 
i mean i she he doesn't throw women in her face no women call the house or anything 
uh 
you never know what she doesn't 
you know question him about where he's been or anything like that and 
i  
she just 
i just can't believe that i just think that's terrible 
yeah she's got 
she's got 
a lot of kids 
there's um 
three boys and 
like four girls 
yeah 
maybe 
maybe 
because she says  us americans are different 
than 
than they were raised 
and they are 
but i told her i you know there isn't 
i will never be married if 
my man's gonna be cheating on me 
i won't marry him 
uhhum 
yep 
no it  quite a few times 
and that  i mean i also cheated on him too you know we both did it 
but um 
it 
once i had my son 
i was ready to settle down i'm not 
you know i wasn't going for that stuff no more and he still wanted to do that 
you know 
and lie and cheat make up stories and 
and he still does it 
i don't and and i don't understand why i feel like he's a grown man if he was out 
don't make up a story 
and 
his mother also make 
you know they're just it just 
it's very stressful for me and 
and i that's another 
another reason why i don't want my son going there for  
you know much longer 
um 
but 
his dad pays 
pays her 
for the 
because i can't afford it 
yeah 
and he's got control over that because i 
i mean he was going to a different babysitter a woman 
um 
that baby sits 
and she  did very very well she did all that stuff that i would like to  be done she took him to the library 
she had nap time at a certain time and they were and 
you know lay down and 
it's just totally different 
uh at the grandmother's 
uhhum 
yeah 
no 
no 
uhhum 
yeah uh 
i don't think he spends  with him like that you know 
he sees him at his mom's house 
and 
you know will come by and see him at my house but 
i try to 
um 
put a 
i don't know because we seem to argue a lot 
you know 
and i don't like to for my kid to see that 
so i try 
i try to do 
the best thing for my son 
uhhum 
yeah 
like when i need things and i call him up i need diapers 
i need wipes i need twenty dollars yeah 
he's there for me  for that 
financially yeah he's always been there 
for me 
um 
hopefully 
it 
well it's kind of hard he see 
he's got two other kids 
and one kid he had while we was together 
that he does not see at all 
because the mother 
um he played her because he was with me and 
you know if 
and she just was like forget him i don't want him to be around my child and the other one 
she's a older she's 
they 
she's like ten 
and um 
he says that because his daughter don't call he only  she only calls for 
when she wants things 
so he doesn't 
you know he will 
he will get whatever he can for her when she calls but he doesn't spend time with her 
it's 
so i just see a pattern 
you know 
i just feel like this is gonna happen to me eventually 
well i 
i 
i just hope he stays  i 
i i don't know maybe not but 
i grew up without a father and i really 
um 
have that 
against my father because he lived around us he never called us you know 
it and now i've really got resentment against him 
i mean as old as i am i still got that against him 
and that's what i'd i want my 
you know my son to keep 
i want him to know his   
father and be around him 
even though he's not the best 
best of person but 
you know 
i will raise him the best way i can 
yes hopefully 
yeah 
because i've thought about that like well maybe i will just 
wait a few years and start dating 
uhhum 
oh i see 
yep 
so the the original father didn't wasn't around for the kids 
oh 
that's sad 
see i don't want that to happen to me 
because i just that's um 
i mean i had a guy that i 
did start dating when my son was a baby 
but um 
it just he got 
he fell in love with me 
i mean he wanted us to be together he wanted us to have a house 
he wanted to 
have my kid have his last name and i was like 
are you crazy 
this child is somebody else's 
you know kid not yours 
and he didn't he 
he didn't like that he loved my son you know 
and we're   still good friends 
and he still comes sees my son but 
i couldn't 
uhhum 
uhhum 
unless 
you know his dad was 
totally gone 
but he's been there ever since you know 
i was pregnant all through my pregnancy and 
he's been there 
for his whole two years 
i wouldn't do that to him 
his last name 
he's got his first name too 
no i gave him um 
different middle name 
i didn't like his  
oh you didn't 
yeah 
yeah 
my mom didn't like that she said when they go to school 
you're gonna have they're gonna have different last name than you 
i'm like so what 
i don't care 
i hate my my last name is terrible i hate my last name 
uhhum 
i don't know why that was but it sounds like it i guess and 
yeah 
i was called a lot of little things 
no 
yeah 
i mean i tried and tried 
i just   see it that he's not changing 
i and i you know you keep hoping he's 
you just keep hoping 
but it's all upon him and obviously he doesn't love me enough 
to really want to change and 
settle down he still wants to do those things he's doing 
and i just need to move on 
uhhum 
no 

i don't know i 
don't know if i could trust him you know 
because that that's happened where he's like i won't do it again and 
and he did it again 
i feel  
once a cheater always cheater 
to me 
you know maybe maybe to the next woman he won't do that to 
but he's gotten away with it so many times with me i feel like he wouldn't 
really do it 
you know 
if he wants to yeah anybody's capable of changing if they want to 
uhhum 
he would  
absolutely have to build my trust 
for a long time 
uhhum 
uhhum 
um 
i first of all couldn't be her friend 
because i mean i've got a lot of i  this man to death it's like 
and that might be something that was 
is holding me back from dating but you know it will eventually go away 
but um 
yeah i would warn her i don't care if 
i 
if he's 
he looks like the perfect guy because 
yeah i think he looks like the he's a very nice guy  you know 
he just doesn't know how to 
stick with one woman i don't think 
yeah 
um 
hm 
they like me but then they don't like me 
you know  i uh 
i think they're two faced 
very much two faced the mother especially 
because i've i know she's talked about me and stuff 
which hurts my feelings because i'm 
i'm 
i mean i might cause um 
him to 
you know i don't cause him if he you know and when he's at their house we will get in an argument and that's what does it makes them not like me 
because 
the 
the yelling and stuff 
but i don't i feel 
i feel like i'm not the one that makes him yell 
he's the one that's yelling in their house and 
you know he's the one cursing and 
causing all the rackets but 
yeah he's 
yeah he's twenty six 
yep 
nope 
i met him through a friend 
i met him 
through his brother was dating my best friend 
yeah 
but he's always 
um 
he's had like 
girlfriends 
where he's lived with them and he had a child and they'd live together but he cheated on her 
so that broke that up and he still messed around on her and then he was dating 
another girl 
and i like told on him 
and that made him not like me for a while 
but now he's with that girl he was cheating on with he's with her now they live together 
so he's like going through a pattern too and i 
he's a  they're like 
they're real nice people 
it's just they  i 
you know feel like they don't 
and i try to tell him you know don't mess up again 
i just 
like grow up 
yeah 
but i've got more influence i think 
maybe 
i'm not sure 
i'm hoping i've got more influence 
over him than his father does 
uhhum 
no 
yeah they 
yeah 
she moved in with him 
um 
which i'm so happy for because she didn't 
she dated a little bit when we were kids but 
she  did again 
like 
yeah 
she  she was just by herself for 
like 
years and years she's fifty now 
and she got a divorce when i was three 
so she's 
and hopefully they will get married soon they've been together for  
over a year and a half 
yeah he's a real nice guy 
yeah 
uhhum 
yeah 
me and my mom are real close 
i talk to her every day 
i talk to all my family my brothers and sisters every day 
uhhum 
yep 
yep uh my oldest she's the oldest um 
she's got three kids one 
her oldest is by a different guy and 
her new husband adopted her 
because they she never sees him 
um 
and then they got two other girls 
and they live together got a house 
you know 
they're on 
they're going through marriage they've been together for like five years and 
they're 
not going 
they're not doing very 
right now but 
hopefully 
you know they will get over that 
and then i got an 
older brother 
who um 
him and his girlfriend 
moved in together and they just had a baby 
they just had a baby 
couple days ago 
yeah they had a little boy and i got a little sister 
she is twenty two and she lives with her boyfriend 
she doesn't have any kids and 
she works and he works 
so everybody does pretty good now 
yeah my aunts do 
i think my grandpa goes to church 
yeah 
i  want to 
i just don't do it 
oh you 
to learn about 
god 
you know he doesn't know anything about god right now i don't think at all 
um 
no 
i pray 
at night 
you know i don't think he knows 
what i'm who i'm praying to or anything 
yeah i will 
yeah i will explain that to him 
sunday school 
yeah 
oh it was on saturday 
oh okay 
yeah that's why i  
i would like him to get  the sunday school 
i would like him to go to them 
classes before sunday you know 
prayer and all that 
nope 
i i don't i wouldn't 
i will i'm not sending him to a columbus public school 
but an alternative  
school i will send him to 
um private school i don't 
i would if i had the money to tell you the truth 
i would 
most definitely but i know i couldn't afford it 
that's why i've never 
thought about it really 
no 
they've just gotten a lot worse like 
um my niece they 
my sister had moved in with me 
for a little bit when her and husband was having problems and my niece is uh eight 
well she was in fifth grade in 
there's a elementary school that we went to when we were kids 
and she just said they were cursing smoking cigarettes and everything and i just am like 
oh my gosh 
yes 
i mean it's really bad these days 
my mom works for the columbus public schools 
the food service and she knows that they're really bad 
and that's really sad but 
they're not doing anything about it 
uhhum 
uhhum 
well i think they got that all off of um 
the tv 
i mean 
that influenced 

all the kids 
in the world who  that that will happen 
through that 
bad influence all the kids 
you know 
and they're like wow let's do this too we can make school 
you know let out for a little bit 
i they might not be doing it 
to um 
cause any harm but 
you know 
yes for attention and uh 
yeah 
were crazy 
yeah 
yeah i bet you i'm 
i'm sure those kids probably had problems 
because i i mean i was like the very i was a very depressed 
kid too when i was teenager like always wanted to kill myself and stuff 
you know 
i just 
maybe i'm not sure because 
i don't know how there parents were 
it could have been 
it could have been the people they were hanging around 
they  
you know 
i mean i think they could 
try 
if their  their kids try and push them away 
they shouldn't 
you know let their kids push them away 
you know 
i guess you can't make your kid go out with you and do things 
they want stay in their room i know 
i don't know but i would know there was something going on 
with my kid 
and i would definitely keep a eye out and 
you know 
figure out what's going on 
you know 
i know 
see i would be all up in the room too looking see what he's 
reading i i would have be just like my mother was even 
hated it but 
i would 
i would do that 
yep 
yep 
yep 
she read my notes and all that 
i 
i don't know i don't remember 
yep 
ok 

i uh grew up in  
is this is this 
because 
it slipped 
i 
since i set it 
it's okay 
um 
uh 
grew up in cincinnati 
i went to school 
at rhode island school of design 
went east to school 
um 
came back  uh 
uh 
to uh 
got married and came back to 
uh cleveland 
lived there for awhile 
met my husband hitchhiking back from 
one year 
ah 
ah 
then when he went to graduate school in columbus 
i came down here 
and 
don't have mister stergle with us anymore but 
um 
i stuck 
since 
seventy 
yeah 
i like it a lot 
uh 
it's 
it's changed a lot since i've been here 
you know i mean it's really come a long way in terms of 
of 
the amenities of 
you know restaurants and and and museums and we get all the good movies now and wexner center's been a big boost and 
so there's you know it's a whole different town than it was when i first came here 
but it's still 
relatively cheap and it's easy to get around 
and uh 
it's got a lot going for it 
mmhmm 
yeah 
i'm a freelance artist 
uh 
illustrator 
in fact um 
marketing communications 
for ohio state is one  is one of my big clients 
and um 
uh 
i also i also have 
various 
part time jobs 
for the medical 
but i'm mainly 
i'm mainly an artist 
i work in uh pen and ink and colored pencil and do mainly humorous 
sort of things cartoony things 
um 
i 
i had stuff in  
and there was uh a paper they used to send 
to parents of students i think they stopped publishing that 
i had stuff in that 
frequently 
um i've had some stuff in  lately 
and i'm working on football stuff right now 
well right now um 
i work third 
third shift 
at a 
men's wear 
for the medical insurance 
yeah uh yeah and i do computer processing mostly what you know i 
i work from ten at night until eight in the morning so 
um there's not a lot of phone to do mainly it's computer processing 
running reports and stuff 
no 
no 
nope it's just a small independent 
yeah 
well 
uh the first 
the first thing is 
i think it's the best thing that ever 
that you i 
best thing in the world 
it's a wonderful neighborhood 
right 
yeah 
um the second thing 
would be 
uh 
the um 
cultural activities 
that we have 
um 
i  
wexner center'd 
be one of my primary ones because there's so much going on down there but the art museum 
and um 
uh 
oh right 
that cultural arts center and 
columbus music hall i mean there's just a million things 
there's lots of of 
uh 
theater 
and the third thing would be 
we got restaurants 
oh yeah 
i love it when people come from out of town because then i get to try new places and i'm way behind i need more company 
yeah 
yeah 
right 
yeah 
um i'm sort of in 
upper clintonville 
um 
um 
not so much 
um  
for 
for fifteen years i lived uh down on  
which is more 
um 
lot of artists live there but i'm amazed that my new street 
is full of artists too 
it's just you know 
older 
more established artists 
so um 
no 
no 
no 
yeah 
yeah 
lower clintonville 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
um 
uh 
the the the public 
transit system i mean i know they're doing the best they can but i don't see how we're ever gonna get out of this without light rail 
and i'm 
that that that the levy didn't pass 
um 
let's see 
boy 
i 
i don't know 
i mean we got a great airport with great connections and cheap flights 
that's no that's no drawback we're not isolated 
um 
boy i don't i 
yeah 
um and 
this is something i've thought about a lot because if i had stayed in cincinnati say where it's very 
conservative 
you know not real open to new things 
or if i had stayed on the east coast where of course it'd be really competitive 
i 
i probably wouldn't be 
working as a freelancer today 
i came to columbus there wasn't 
you know there wasn't much going on when i came here 
and uh you know it's 
oh we've got art 
we're open to that 
you know 
you know there's not a big established gallery system and everything so a lot of things were just available 
you know 
just 
could walk in and show anywhere 
and um 
and so i you know i met a lot of people doing that 
and it's  
i mean i'm  mainly friends with 
the same people i met then you know   
artists my age but um 
it's been 
and there's you know i 
i don't belong to any formal 
groups in columbus 
but 
um 
it's a  it's a real strong network of people you know everybody  
knows 
everybody 
you know so it's uh you know if  if you have a problem if you wanna talk to somebody 
well if if somebody you know personally doesn't they know somebody 
who can  who can help you with that so 
um 
i have work in uh p m gallery in the short north 
and also at the show of hands 
galleries 
and 
yeah 
yeah ellen at lane avenue has been a big booster of my work i mean 
i was really lucky 
across her 
um they try to limit the the  
the 
uh 
i said i didn't belong to any groups and that's not true i belong to ohio designer craftsmen 
and um 
uh they  
in the in the shops they try to limit it to ohio 
artists but 
the membership is 
is 
national 
so 
it's not it's not really closed 
it's just 
sort of focusing on ohio 
um 
i  i think it fills its niche 
you know i mean i mean wexner has a niche and the and the museum has a niche 
and um 
i think it fills it very well 
yeah 
yeah 

well i'm lucky in that way because 
um 
i get travel 
a lot 
and it and so 
you know if there's something i really wanna see chicago's not that far 
washington's not that far 
um new york's 
and  i don't get to new york that often but um 
you know i mean i can i  
still have access to a lot of stuff if i wanna 
go to the trouble 
i do i do 
um 
art fairs 
and i have 
you know i've 
got a couple in chicago and and i have couple in 
uh the washington area 
so 
oh lots of people travel 
all over 
i 
you know i mean that's 
i don't 
lots  do 
you know i mean they do shows on christmas if they had them but 
i you know i 
i'd do 
ten twelve a year 
which is not  
not a lot 
yeah 
yeah 
me 
yeah 
uh for me 
uh 
it 
it seems like 
um 
i have a mid western sort of humor 
which works best in the mid west 
i mean i have 
i have some 
east coast clientele and and 
uh  
and 
but like when i go to florida 
the people who 
who really like my work 
happen to be the people who are vacationing from 
columbus so 
no i've never been to that one 
that one has a big  
that's a 
a famous one 
oh yeah 
yeah 
oh yeah it's huge 
well 
i  
i 
read a lot about 
about 
uh 
these particular  
british artists 
even before the show and before 
um the mayor had a cow 
so to speak but um 
uh 
so i 
you know i mean it's 
some of some of the pieces are interesting it's 
it's not 
exactly  
my style 
but 
frankly 
i 
you know 
i 
just didn't see 
up about 
i mean i  i saw  
uh 
uh 
the piece 
the piece that he specifically objected to and and 
read about it 
and 
so i mean i have to assume that it 
i mean it's an election year and 
his yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
i think it was just a political thing 
yeah 
yeah 
oh yeah 
yeah 
and i haven't i haven't heard the rest of the story 
but 
um what i've heard of 
i mean 
in 
in court he wouldn't have a chance 
a snowball's 
actually being able to 
to rescind the funding but still 
i mean 
it's a 
we don't like to think 
things happening 
a little bit yeah 
um 
that 
uh 
well i know about the gorilla masks 
and that uh you know i 
it's a a women's organization  
uh 
to promote women artists 
and and to um 
object to the 
to male hierarchy 
you know  
that only only men get are in the museums and 
only men get the big 
gallery shows and stuff like that 
i  i don't think so 
in new york it might be 
i mean like i say it's a lot more competitive there here 
i think 
i think 
columbus 
is 
and the mid west in general 
i 
think is much 
more open 
to 
you know to art whatever it is wherever it comes from 
and there's not the isn't you know there's not 
the 
the 
old boy network 
you know 
not as not as much who you know 
to get into things 
uh  
or  
or that 
women are allowed to know the people 
that the boys know 
so it's not 
it's not as closed off that 
way 
uhhum 
yeah 
ah 
yeah 
yeah 
oh yeah 
yeah it's true i i 
i 
i had jansen and i 
i'm you know that was 
course i was 
i went to art school so jansen was just in case you had to look something up it was there 
um 
our lecturers were all 
so that you know  
that the art history  
we got was 
was different than 
what would be 
what would just be in jansen so i never 
thought about that 
but 
um 
yeah 
lots of people who 
jansen is their only exposure 
would 
gee i wonder why women don't do 
yeah 
but historically 
you know women 
were  you know 
it was a man's field and and you know even women who were doing it and doing it well didn't get 
the attention didn't get 
they didn't make it into the history books yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
but  you know i mean that would that's 
that's 
i think so 
i think so if you're willing and you know 
anybody who's willing to put out the effort i mean you do have to 
you know that you have to sell yourself there's 
you know 
you're not gonna just sit around and wait to be discovered 
but um 
if you put out the effort i really  
i don't think there's 
that kind of 
that kind of discrimination anymore 
badly 
marketing is not my strong suit i mean most of the stuff that i get is just 
is a 
is an accident i started working for o s u because 
another 
uh illustrator that they used who wasn't gonna be able to do the work anymore recommended me 
you know that kind of thing 
but he was a guy 
well there's 
um 
i mean 
i'm pretty much 
you just 
keep making calls making appointments 
sending out slides 
um it helps if you can get a  
you know if you know an artist who's 
in a gallery 
um 
you know if you can 
use them as a  
as a reference 
um 
but that 
it's 
it's mainly just  
you 
just have to 
uh knock on a lot of doors 
and be prepared for a lot of 
of 
no's 
uhhum 
um three years 
uhhum 

oh  well they knew 
all  all different things 
i mean i mean culturally 
you know it was different 
different music it was it  
course i'm i'm 
in a suburban high school in cincinnati you didn't get exposed to much 
uh so that  that was the 
the biggest thing 
well and of course they talk funny 
in the east but 
um 
that you know 
other than that other than the culture shock 
um 
it wasn't 
it wasn't that different 
yeah if i had 
um 
if i had stayed for the i i didn't graduate so if i'd stayed for the fourth year 
um when we did a lot would do a lot of um 
uh 
uh 
making up a portfolio that kind of thing 
um 
i probably then i would have started going to interviews and i  i would've 
i probably would've stayed 
but 
it was 
yeah 
oh yeah yeah i liked it a lot 
um 
but it was it was nineteen seventy and there was kent state and 
you know all that stuff going on and it just 
school just didn't seem that important 
and also i think i think this happens to a lot of people as they approach senior year and say oh my god you know i'm gonna graduate and then i'm gonna have to be a grownup 
ok 
i won't graduate 
which is 
well yeah you know could have done that too 
it 
i mean i i  i don't know  i enough about it to really say but it 
i 
can't 
i mean it 
i don't know where they got that 
i 
you know maybe i'm oblivious to things but i mean i mean seems like there's 
lot of worse places 
i 
you know 
from my 
perspective which is skewed of course 
to me i think it just seems that way i mean it was 
we're only talking about ten cases that's not very many 
you know  i mean 
you could by coincidence 
have them all be african american 
um 
if i were african american i think i would have a different perspective 
and i you know i don't 
don't live in a neighborhood where we see a lot of police 
so 
uh 
you know i just don't 
i'm  i'm not in touch with it 
with that situation 
no we're pretty white 
uhhum 
yeah 
well 
i  
among the people i know 
i  i 
you know we're  
i  i think it's a pretty tolerant city 
um 
uh 
i know a lot of people who live 
down in old town 
you know in a very 
ah diverse environment and um 
um 
you know i just 
i just don't i don't personally know any racists i don't think 
i'm sure i'm sure it is 
you know it's just the circles i move in 
yeah yeah yeah i it surprises me to  to find that that columbus is is so out of shape 
um 
but i'm 
in the i 
well you know in the circles that i move in 
um 
everybody is very  
middle aged and they all quit 
the sudden trying to beat off the reaper 
and um 
uh 
so 
you know i mean i mean 
well and course they were always hippies and ate sprouts and 
twigs and leaves 
anyway 
you know so  
you know that's the sort of circles i move in but i know 
because i  have these part time jobs from time to time 
i see a a whole different 
group of people 
and i can say it's 
probably true 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah so i  i mean that 
probably 
circles i move in is what's 
coloring my whole view of columbus 
i mean there's 
a lot  i'm sure there's a lot i don't 
know 
oh yeah 
yeah and i  i think i think even even 
if you're aware of everything that's here you still 
in the back of your mind you just have that 
it's  it's just columbus it's just columbus 
ah maybe it's because 
um 
people don't 
take advantage of  
don't realize what's actually here 
um 
don't realize how it 
i mean yeah it's not chicago 
it's not new york 
it's not 
there's a lot of places it's not 
but it's  
ah 
you know it's not a backwater either 
well they need to get out more 
you know all this 
oh we will never be a major league city until we have major league sports 
well  you know i guess 
um getting out more wouldn't help those 
it's um 
ah 
that that would be  
you know that would be such a small 
part 
of 
of 
civilization anywhere 
for me 
and um 
i'm pretty pleased with the way 
things are moving along and i just 
i'd 
i'm 
i really do think people don't take advantage of it 
the way they should 
i think so 
i think so 
yeah 
yeah a little 
a little geography wouldn't hurt 
yeah that 
that's one of the drawbacks 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
or the festivals in the summer 
that they have downtown 
i mean those are 
those are really great and they're you know i mean 
they're they're crowded but they're peaceful you know there's not 
there's not rioting in the streets and there's a lot to do 
and great 
you know great music 
yeah 
yeah 
no i don't 
i  
i do 
ah 
i have i've have 
uh 
and you know there kids in the neighborhood and 
the grownups talk and i  i talk to the kids too i there's a a girl that lives next door who i we talk a lot 
she just started at um everett 
the uh 
arts middle school 
boy 
i 
you know 
i 
i don't 
not having kids and then you know not being that close to it it's hard to know 
i mean i've always 
i've always thought that 
that 
um 
what their friends did 
and what they 
what they were exposed to at home 
had 
as much 
influence as as anything that 
that the school could do but i know the school 
school is a very powerful force in a kid's life 
you know i mean it is a kid's life 
yeah 
with  
no i no i am definitely in favor of that i mean 
yes 
it's the 
the parents 
is the parent is supposed to do it 
and one would hope that the 
parent 
would get there before 
before the health class did but if the parent isn't gonna get there 
this is the only way they're 
ever gonna 
find 
uhhum 
i 
i think it is 
because 
uh 
when  
i was a sophomore in high school before it dawned on me that tab a and slot b 
to the stuff that we were learning with the charts and the diagrams 
and um 
but i think kids are a lot more aware now 
from 
because of what they're exposed to 
you know in movies and everything  you know just 
tv just daily life 
um either they're a lot more aware 
they 
they have 
i 
they go into it with a lot of 
of uh myths and misapprehensions 
but they definitely have thoughts about it 
and and 
i think they i think they need to 
i well 
you know i  
i don't see how we can say 
i mean 
we can  
refuse to  
to see certain classes 
of 
movies or 
or watch 
certain classes of shows but i 
you know without getting into that first amendment thing i can't 
you know i don't see how we can 
have a code of conduct 
yeah 
yeah 
boy i don't know 
i'm 
i'm 
you know i've 
never seen it happen in 
in my lifetime 
you know 
so i  i don't know if it could be but then of course it can't go on the same way 
you know it can't 
keep 
i don't 
think 
the 
weather girl 
yeah 
yeah 
it it 
it makes me wonder because 
um 
i don't 
i don't see a lot of movies so a lot of this is you know just 
from reading reviews and stuff 
but it seems like 
you know 
last 
last year two explosions would do the 
job this year you gotta have five explosions 
and two car 
chases 
and and mutilated bodies 
you know it's it 
just seems like 
it 
it 
you need more and more sensationalism to 
sell your 
to sell your 
product and uh 
it's scary 
it's  
it's really hard to do 
to 
to 
talk about 
morals 
um without 
bringing 
uh you know 
religious background or something into it i think 
i think 
ah 
the way the schools should approach it 
if you get pregnant it's gonna ruin your life so you don't want to do that 
do you 
sort of thing 
boy that's a 
that's a really tough one 
i hadn't i hadn't thought about 
that and and 
high school kids are so 
touchy about 
i mean 
about 
touchy about sexual identity and 
and so likely  you know so insecure in their own that they're really 
likely to come down hard on somebody 
who has a has a different orientation 
and i  i don't know 
i don't know 
uhhum 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah you can't ignore it 
i  
because  
you know because that's 
something else when i was in high school i  
don't 
think 
i knew the word 
but 
um 
now  
everybody knows 
anybody who's a little bit different is likely to be called a faggot 
and and 
so it's 
better if you can diffuse that 
but 
i  boy i wouldn't know 
how to approach it 
i mean i think it should be approached 
but 
i wouldn't have a clue 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
i think 
i think they should 
um 
i 
think a lot of the fear of this material comes 
uh 
from people who hold the belief that 
that 
you choose 
your orientation 
that you can be converted 
to homosexuality and i 
personally don't believe that so it 
i you know i'm not afraid 
of it 
but i can see how 
people would hold the opposite view 
and that i that's where this  comes from but 
since i think they're wrong 
i think it should be my way 
and i think i think you know  i think the material should be there 
i think it  
you know dealt with in a calm and reasonable way 
and i think it should be accessible to the kids 
yeah 
yeah 
i 
think 
i think it's  i think it's fair i think it should be 
that domestic partners 
should be 
should be covered 
i think there should probably be some 
uh 
you know some  some restrictions there should 
be some level of 

commitment 
you know 
can't just be your roommate 
has to be a long standing kind of thing 
yeah you know and that that worries me more than 
i   
understand a lot of the objection is because this is just 
uh 
this is opening the door a crack and the next thing you know 
you know one legal 
step leads to another legal step and then we will have gay marriage and all those things but 
i don't think that would be a bad 
either 
uhhum 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah yeah i heard something about that 
yeah 
well i 
everybody should have to do it the hard way 
i mean frankly 
um i think a lot of people get married without thinking enough about it 
and um 
i know i didn't think that much about it oh well i'm not doing anything else why not 
um 
and um 
ah 
i  i mean ah 
i don't i it seems 
kind of silly to legally have 
two levels i mean either 
either you gonna 
go do it the hard way or you not 
and and 
no legal sanctions are gonna make any particular difference 
to the attitude you have going into it 
right 
divorced yeah 
uh 
three years 
something like that 
hard to remember 
oh it was it was easy 
um 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah we didn't go to court 
uh 
we just agreed 
to get divorced he went to  he you know i didn't even see the lawyer he just brought papers for me to sign and 
yeah there was you know there was no property 
um well there was a house i didn't want it 
so that was easy 
um no children 
so 
it was quite easy for us 
hum 
boy i don't know i'm  
thinking 
you know of the the 
divorced people i know who've had 
children and 
involved 
and um 
boy it always seems to me by the time they get to that step 
it's already 
you know they've 
been to counseling they've already tried a lot of other things 
and that they're 
i don't know whether 
some kind of 
court ordered 
thinking about it 
heavy thinking would uh 
would make any difference or not 
i think so 
i think they should be 
i think they should be subject to the same rigorous scrutiny 
that 
that um hetero couples are 
you know with home visits and and economic tests and all these kind of things 
but um 
the gay people i know 
uh 
the ones that would 
that would want to be parents i think would make great parents 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
well one would  one would hope that 
there would be enough 
uh 
education on the subject that the kids wouldn't think it was that odd 
um 
that 
that 
you had two dads 
were adopted by two 
i mean 
i mean there's 
a lot uh  
it's it's difficult to adopt children i mean and it and it should be 
and so 
the children they would likely 
take would be troubled to begin with 
you know mixed race 
or or handicapped or 
you know 
hard to place 
older kids you know 
uh yeah it would be just one more thing 
yeah 
one more thing to deal with on the other hand 
it beats 
beats 
you know 
growing up in fifty foster homes or an orphanage or 
yeah 
yeah 
uhhum 
yeah 
yeah 
getting them some place stable 
with people who want them 
yeah 
yeah 
and like i say i don't i don't believe that homosexuality is taught 
um 
i 
think the kid will grow up and 
discover girls and 
be just fine 
or grow up and discover boys either 
yeah 
yeah 
well i  it 
starts with 
with allowing uh 
heather has two mommies 
in the elementary school library 
it's 
um 
we focus on sex so much 
in our society i think 
and and 
part of family  
so uh 
sex is such a small part of family life 
you know i mean it 
uh especially with the elementary school kids 
i mean it's just 
is 
is there milk and cookies after school 
that's the key 
you know  you know do i feel safe is this a place i can go is there somebody 
who always takes care of me 
and and i think left to their own devices 
ah 
the younger kids wouldn't think anything about it 
you know 
you got two adults in your house it doesn't matter what gender they are 
and i think 
i think if we could 
you know if 
if we could just keep that going 
into into 
middle school 
where it's 
where it's not such 
it's 
it's not weird it's just a family 
um 
then when you start to talk about homosexuality it would be easier to 
uh 
it would be easier for the kids to 
to see that 
they're just people 
you know 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
um 
i 
i see it as a problem and and if i 
if i 
if i were 
african american 
i would 
i would not like to see it simply because 
uh 
you know it it 
it's a  a child not being brought up 
in his 
you know in his 
tradition 
but on the other hand 
i'd 
hate to  i hate to see 
a child left in foster care 
or in an orphanage when he could have a home 
and um 
i think ah 
parents who are willing to  
uh 
going 
willing to adopt 
uh 
a black child or a mixed race child 
or an asian child or any  
are gonna are gonna be sensitive to the 
to cultural things because we're just 
you know it's just the  
the way  
things are slanted these days i mean diversity 
is an issue 
and 
people who are 
willing to 
venture out 
into 
uh mixed race adoption 
would 
already be 
way hip 

to diversity 
and would 
would be 
would be interested 
in 
i mean i mean 
not just for the kids sake but but would be interested 
on their own behalf 
in in teaching the child what uh 
what his background really was 
right 
yeah 
exactly 
exactly but i do 
there and there's the other side um 
they  with 
with native americans too 
it's 
you know you know our children are being 
away from us 
well not exactly you're giving up your children and 
and 
something has to be done 
but 
but there's also 
there's also that 
uh 
i  
i mean i think 
that 
it is probably a legitimate 
fear that 
children  children of that group 
are gonna 
you know 
gonna be homogenized 
out of 
out of their heritage 
but 
i don't know 
uh 
you know they're 
without parents 
yeah 
yeah 
if you cared that much about about 
keeping your keeping your own 
well 
there's the kids ready to be 
uhhum 
is 
that's that's what i would 
i would think in that 
i  
i mean because the dominant culture 
it i mean is always gonna be accessible to them 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah and  
yeah 
yeah and and to a certain extent everybody gets the same upbringing 
through  mass media 
and and and 
well 
malls 
yeah 
uhhum 
oh yeah 
is 
yeah 
yeah 
well i 
what 
what neighborhood do you live in 
i you know i see asians and indians and 
all  
everywhere but boy they don't live on my street 
yeah 
yeah 
right yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
uhhum 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
um 
people that live there i mean we've got the the you know the indian department stores right down there on high street and 
and a 
couple of asian groceries 
but 
you know i 
i 
i don't know where they live 
i 
it seems  it seems like for those stores to be opening there they must be somewhere in clintonville but i don't 
i don't know 
well i don't know the people that i see 
around 
um 
you know they're grownups 
really 
yeah 
um 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah um you're  you yeah you may be right 
could be 
could be 
i never thought of that 
an option 
i think so 
i think so 
um 
it's 
it's so sad to see 
a girl 
you know 
have so many options closed off 
now i don't mean it's by any  
stretch that it's a tragedy 
to have a baby but 
um 
somebody in high school 
is 
is 
making a lot of decisions she doesn't intend to make 
uh 
and uh 
decisions are happening to her without her making them 
and um 
i think she needs to have 
as many 
facts as she can get her hands on 
yeah 
and i think 
um 
of 
course we would all hope that abortion wouldn't be 
that  that nobody would have an abortion that would be the perfect world because nobody would ever be in a situation where they would need one 
um 
but 
i also think 
uh you know i  i mean 
yeah there shouldn't be there shouldn't  shouldn't spend six weeks on abortion 
six weeks on what to do if you're pregnant 
um 
but 
but i think the subject has to be mentioned 
just 
just in passing in health class maybe and then and then 
there ought to  
it ought to be 
it  
it should be known that you can go to your counselor 
and get some information 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah i'm 
i'm opposed to parental 
but 
i don't have 
so that's 
that 
opinion doesn't mean as 
from someone who did 
well 
yeah in a case like that 
the parents should 
that shouldn't be 
on the other hand i'd hate to see a thirteen year old 
have a baby 
because she was afraid 
yeah 
yeah 
well yeah 
yeah i mean it happened a lot 
and um 
i've 
had two abortions one 
illegal and one legal and 
legal is better 
and um 
yeah and and 
uh 
i would never 
i would  
i would never wanna go back to the old way 
never 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
um i think so i think partial birth isn't 
such a big issue because i mean it hardly ever 
comes up 
but i 
with so many things it's it's like a  it's a foot in the door 
if we can do that then we can say well you know maybe 
not in the 
third trimester and then we can say well not in the second trimester and 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah i 
um 
i mean i know 
so many people who 
you know when they get pregnant 
get so 
are so conscientious 
about about what they eat 
and and i mean they won't take antihistamines 
in hay fever season and you know so many things that they won't do and they're so conscientious about it it's hard for me 
i mean i  i just don't know anybody who 
smoked when they were pregnant or anything like that 
on the other hand i 
think 
i 
think it's a choice 
and um 
i mean you  you wanna 
you wanna try to help them you wanna 
make them aware of health 
issues 
but i mean a lot of women are not getting prenatal care 
either 
and 
and 
that's part of it 
and you can't 
you 
can't arrest them for that you just gotta get them to the doctor 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah i   
if 
if 
a  
there  there can't be sanctions for doing the right thing 
and 
um 
uh 
so i would be  i'm opposed to that 
i well yeah i 
i guess 
you'd have to say that i was 
i 
be opposed to 
arresting mothers for anything 
um 
in 
in 
in that relation 
that it's just 
that the effort should focus 
on 
on getting them to stop 
but not 
forcing them to stop 
whatever it is they're doing 

okay my parents are still married 
i'm from  i lived there all my life i was born here in columbus so i really haven't known anything else 
um 
have a dog named sammy 
i work in the dorms as a night assistant 
and i have a girlfriend right now 
yeah 
yeah my dog's at home 
yeah i have two older brothers one's ten years older the other one's fifteen years older 
yeah 
um it didn't seem that much 
stranger than anyone else 
i mean my 
the middle brother was always around 
he wasn't very social in high school so 
yeah 
um 
i'm a pre art major right now hoping to get into computer animation 
freshman 
i went to  it's the new high school there 
yeah high school a lot of people are really narrow minded and 
work on really trying to fit in in college people are more open idea like open minded 
and they're more willing to express their own ideas 
i was more comfortable here than in high school 
you don't see like 
the big cliques like the popular abercrombie wearing  or 
like all the art students hanging out together it's 
a big mix of people and everyone's doing their own thing 
um 
freshman sophomore year yes 
after that i quit wrestling and 
i just kind of found myself being 
myself 
instead of trying to be someone else 
sports is definitely 
part of a clique you try to be part of the  and the team tries to do everything the same 
so everybody's trying to be like everyone else 
it was part of that i started wrestling because a lot of my friends did 
so 
i mean 
basically the entire winter i'd either  
doing stuff by myself or on the team wrestling with my friends so 
the whole reason i quit wrestling is because the coach wanted me to cut too much weight 
i was really starting to feel it physically 
yeah i was cutting twenty pounds in three days 
dehydration 
you'd run around in three pairs of sweat suits and 
vinyl jump suit over that 
under heaters 
you'd sleep in three pairs of sweats so you'd lose about two and a half pounds in your sleep 
it is that's why i quit 
by the end i was pretty much 
just puking up blood and passing out a lot 
there were a lot of teammates that were cutting that much weight if not more 
they were pretty much doing it for the team 
yeah by then it was junior year 
when we were wrestling  and everyone just figured it was two more years left they could just 
struggle through it 
it definitely did because 
i would sleep 
probably 
the 
eight hours 
right after practice until i woke up in the morning 
i delivered the columbus dispatch in the morning too so 
it was pretty much deliver papers go to class wrestling sleep 
almost all the parents did 
but he'd bring in nutritional list or whatever to explain to the  
blah blah blah 
so 
yeah 
not that i know of none of the other sports teams were so 
inclined to 
like push their athletes to cut weight 
or to do anything extreme to their bodies 
uhhum 
and the lower you are apparently the easier it is or something 
that was the c a h s philosophy anyway 
some of them are athletes they're pretty much just  student council i'm good at school but bad outside of school 
they'd go out and party outside of school but they'd join all like the students against drugs programs 
so they're really hypocritical 
there's a little bit well quite a bit of it was yeah 
some of the people in the group didn't play sports but it wasn't all from one sport or 
it was football wrestlers 
it was usually 
like the best football players the best wrestlers 
in high school yeah i was friends with most of them 
but i just didn't 
hang out with 
the entire crowd 
yeah 
it wasn't so much of a hate thing it was just more these are the people i like to hang out with  
you don't like that that's fine 
our school wasn't really a violent one there weren't really any fights or anything 
it was mostly caucasian 
and very few asian and other ethnicities 
yeah my roommate actually had that teacher and 
none of the allegations are true 
she was alleging that students were writing racial slurs on their desks and stuff 
but 
i had friends in classes of hers and none of them wrote any 
they never saw it they never said anything about it 

a lot of people switch from being like the really quiet more reserved people to the 
party animal 
go out and have fun person 
just the number of people that were here 
brother 
brother jed 
yeah 
um 
i talk to him every now and then 
yeah 
yeah i think every college does 
um 
i'm a lutheran 
and a lot of what he says about everyone going to hell 
is  opposing my beliefs so i stand there and pretty much spar with him about it  he usually ends up getting frustrated and tells me to leave 
well 
he told a jewish friend of mine that 
her grandparents that died in the holocaust went to hell because they were jewish 
yeah he says 
a lot of racial slurs like that he's really homophobic 
where  
i don't know lutheran is a little bit more open to 
homosexuality i guess 
just pretty much that if you ask for forgiveness forgiveness is granted 
whatever 
um doesn't 
just because you sin doesn't mean you're going to  
and 
pretty much stuff like  
and he'd try to quote the bible and i'd have a bible there with me and i'd look it up and 
it wouldn't 
it wouldn't be right at all 
yeah 
yeah 
well when he's telling my friends that their grandparents went to hell because they're of a different religion 
that's pretty extreme 
yeah um 
i've grown up here all my life so it really hasn't shocked me all that  
yeah i had about three or four friends that were actually gay 
it wasn't a huge shock it wasn't my first encounter with homosexuality 
if they wanna get married that's their business i don't 
think  
mine or anyone else to say that they can't 
they're normal people just outside of 
their sexual 
well 
majority of the people prefer 
heterosexual 
relations but they're normal people outside of they're 
homosexuality i mean it's nothing different than regular parents 
i 
really am not educated in that at all so i wouldn't 
probably say anything 
since i'd 
ignorant in the field 
uhhum 
yeah he uses a lot  
different slurs towards 
gay people 
yeah i remember political correctness 
changing the words doesn't change how someone feels about something 
i don't think its made us any better or any  
it's just change the language 
i don't think so not with the diversity that we have here 
i mean if we were that racist of a city then we wouldn't be that accepting to 
gay pride  and the black out that we had on campus a few weeks back 
with the n double a c p 
i 
really don't think we're incredibly racist 
i mean i'm sure there is some 
but it's 
not as extreme as some places that i've been 
birmingham alabama 
yeah 
um 
when i went i went with my friend 
and 
we were staying at his grandpa's and his grandpa would sit on the back porch  
say all kinds of racial slurs towards black 
and everyone would be all right with that 
uhhum 
i think so 
i mean there's enough open minded people in the country 
that i think that we would be ready 
i mean colin powell was pretty close if he would have ran 
yeah 
i'd say 
it's not any different than having a man i mean 
it's 
a person 
she'd just have a different way of going about it  
probably 
i'd say probably the black man 
yeah well 
the white man would probably win but the black man also 
has a 
he has a better chance than the woman i think 
simply  
it's not too much of a change from the status quo 
i was too young 
no 
all of his problems have  personal problems that really shouldn't have been touched on 
except the media got into it 
and 
um 
i mean we look up to the president to be a moral man whatever but if you look at the other nations they weren't 
that shocked that a president would do something like that 
they were wondering why we were making such a big deal out of it 
and 
pretty much 
all the other problems 
well there weren't really too many other problems i mean the economy's 
doing really 
and 
foreign relations 
are always shaky but 
they're getting a little bit better 
i'd probably vote for bush 
over clinton 
i don't think that'd change my mind about anything i mean 
i don't 
approve of his immoral behavior but 
it doesn't change the way he runs the country 
i'm just more of a conservative person i mean 
i'm not sure exactly what his platform is 
but i've seen him speak a couple  
and 
i don't know he just 
impresses me more than al gore 
al gore really doesn't entice me at all he claims he invented the internet 
all this other stuff 
no it'd probably be  with his foreign policy or domestic policy that would change my mind 
or some kind of tax program 
that would probably affect my decision a little bit 
because i worked with a guy that was a cocaine addict for a while 
and 
he couldn't have any kind of caffeine otherwise he'd get the shakes and he took all kinds of pills 
to help 
calm him down 
and to learn anything it had to be the same thing over and over and over again until he got it right 
and that type of person i don't think would make a very effective president because 
i don't know president needs to be able to think fast on their feet 
that would probably change my decision a little bit 
yeah i don't think i could vote for a violent president 
i could vote for a president that made some mistakes with 
their personal life 
gun control 
i'm not really too interested in 
i mean you look at israel people are carrying guns in the street 
big huge  and 
they're one of the safest nations in the country 
then you look at england they have no guns at all and they're 
relatively safe 
so i mean 
it's 
more our society than the guns i believe it's more the person that would have the gun than the gun itself 
guns should definitely be kept in a lock box 
where kids can't get them 
besides that there's not a whole lot that 
government can do it's more the parents' responsibility to keep the guns out of their 
kids' hands 
no the worst thing that happened was a wallet got stolen out of a locker 
yeah 
pretty much 
here at college i really haven't witnessed any violence at all 
i haven't seen any fights i haven't seen anyone get shot i mean you read about it in the lantern but 
the only thing that i was really shocked about was 
the 
people begging on high street 
yeah that's really not something you see in worthington 
well 
i agree that we should help them 
maybe through some sort of government 
program 
but i think what really hurts them the most is the people that actually give them the money on high street because it really doesn't motivate them to get out of the gutter 
i mean if they can make a living off of begging change off of college students they're probably gonna stay with that because it's real easy life 
it's about the same 
they use drugs but not to the extreme 
that 
college students do 
high school 
marijuana 
acid 
mushrooms 
no 
i didn't know anybody in 
high school but in college i know some people that have used  
ecstasy 
it was more after the movie go 
mmhmm 
it was about a 
bunch of teenage ravers 
and i mean 
i don't think a lot of people have ever heard of ecstasy until that movie 
kind of 
it's like an advertisement for it 
yeah 
yeah i mean a lot of people really 
that i knew anyway didn't know about ecstasy until they saw that movie and  
it was the whole talk  
high school whatever 
there were a couple that would go to raves every now and then and use it 
downtown 
abandoned warehouses that get rented out for a night 
they're pretty much all underground things they have a web page up i'm not sure what the address is right now 
no i've had friends go 
i was gonna go to one on halloween but didn't 
not really at parties parties are usually just 
mostly kegs 
sometimes there's pot sometimes there's not 
usually 
every weekend 
mmhmm 
they go to clubs 
they go to bars clubs um raves 
any place where there's dancing 
and there's lighting effects like strobe lights disco balls 
yeah 
mmhmm 
yeah 
not at all 
mmhmm 
parties didn't change at all 
no kids just think oh it can't happen to me i'm invincible 
he was recovered 
uh he was about thirty four years old 
and he was the assistant manager of a video game store i worked at in high school 
i mean he was a funny guy he was a really nice guy but 
it took him a while to catch on to things 
yeah 
there's a lot more in college college it's seven nights a week 
you can go anywhere 
get something to drink 
yeah 
yeah 
mmhmm 
there's 
a mild fear it seems the cops always 

girls 
i've never seen them take a guy out of a bar 
uhhum 
i'm not sure 
it's usually the girls look younger than guys i guess i don't know 
because they always dress up and everything when they go to the bars 
so 
i mean the cops are just looking for people that look younger 
they don't have time to go and look at the stamps on everyone's hands and 
check their i d's 
i mean the guys are trying to look older the girls are trying to look younger 
guys will drink at the bar girls usually drink before the bar 
as is my experience 
because the girls are afraid and paranoid of getting caught with  
with a container at the bar 
the guys think it's macho or whatever to be able to buy beer 
yeah four nights a week sometimes 
recently it's been like 
saturdays 
that's about it 
yeah because there's no fear of being caught by the parents 
there's no one to like 
check up on you 
in your dorm room 
i mean 
you're pretty much in control of your life at this point 
i don't 
i don't really remember october if that 
yeah i still had a three point two 
first quarter 
yeah i s 
i moved into the dorms 
late september 
last fall 
me and my  
two or 
two other of my roommates 
took a trip i went skydiving white water rafting and skydiving again right before we moved in 
like 
skydiving wednesday 
white water rafting thursday and friday skydiving saturday move in sunday 
um 
the skydiving's 
up by wooster 
and then the white water rafting is down in west virginia on the new river 
yeah 
and i'm trying to work on my license for skydiving though 
uhhum 
i really didn't start 
drinking until probably 
early 
or late last summer 
right before college and then 
couple times nothing really big 
i know a lot of my friends did but i didn't 
i don't know how 
you would define it as serious at this point 
because college is mostly binge drinking 
i think the real problem comes when you start drinking alone and everyday 
because i mean when your friends aren't around and there's no parties to go to you usually don't drink 
i'd say my ex girlfriend 
she could drink more than i could 
and 
she'd sit 
up in their room and drink alone sometimes 
a little bit 
her mom's a severe alcoholic 
i'm still living in the dorms until this 
wednesday 
moving home for the summer 
working 
taking a summer class 
i'm 
living in an apartment 
uhhum 
yeah i knew 
two of them since i was real little 
then the other one just 
fit in really well 
yeah 
she lives two doors down 
and um 
i came back from working on my ceramics one night and she'd just gotten back from a party 
and she was talking in the hall with 
my roommate 
and we went back to our room and we watched a movie and my roommate that she was talking to played around on his computer 
uhhum 
just kind of hit it off from there 
uhhum 
um 
some kind of computer animation like at a video game 
at some sort of 
like 
movie company like pixar or 
something like that 
yeah 
that's want 
i've been playing video games since i was two 
so 
um 
just to get in the school 
there's about 
thirty people 
applying they let three in 
uhhum 
to the art and tech department 
uhhum 
um 
you have to take a foundation of courses 
which consists of 
art one sixty two through art 
two sixty 
um 
then you submit a portfolio in the fall for review 
and they decide which students are good enough to be in the department 
uhhum 
they let three people in fall quarter  three people in spring quarter 
uhhum 
this fall's the first time i will be submitting my portfolio 
definitely 
i have a 
five hour course 
the first term 
of summer quarter 
and then i'm probably gonna be working on my portfolio the second term 
um 
my parents are all for it they've always been supportive of whatever 
we wanted 
my dad seems to think i should go on to law because 
there's 
law in everything you can do anything with a law degree 
yeah 
no he doesn't have a problem with it at all 
yeah 
oh when i was a senior in high school i wish 
my parents would've pushed me to do something practical but i'm glad they didn't 
because it gave me a chance to make my own decision 
well it would've been 
something that they would've supported and something that 
i would've probably been pretty good at 
and 
they would've made it so i wouldn't have had to make the decision 
i mean that was 
a hard decision to 
yeah 
uhhum 
thinking about journalism 
um 
design 
graphic design in particular 
after i quit wrestling i got really into computers so 
i pretty much live on my computer 
i'm on the computer at least six hours a day 
not at all 
you're talking to people all over the country and 
i mean you're 
becoming more diversified because 
you get 
thoughts and opinions from people 
from all across the world and 
and it's not just 
like one group of people 
yeah 
um 
media has a lot of control 
over people 
but 
i believe that 
sometimes people just need a kick like that 
to get them thinking about it 
then they will start to notice it in their life and 
once they start noticing it they will start 
getting more and more into it 
no humans are violent by nature i believe 
mean 
people have been at war since the beginning of man 
it's more or less greed that causes violence it's not 
media 
media 
just like the ecstasy was 
an advertisement showing what you could do 
tv's 
showing you violence that you 
could do 
if you're driven to it 

okay one 
two 
three 
four 
five 
testing  
when i was a kid my father got this tape recorder 
in the days when they were those big 
you know the wheels 
and god only knows he'd get a half a dozen drinks in him then he'd go around the house 
testing testing say a few words for  and we used to think get him 
out of here you know 
i guess that's what it is but i don't have a video camera either but i as soon as you said that i 
thought i could just see him you know oh 
drove me  say a few words for posterity he'd say and we'd say 
get out of here 
no 
i i um 
have very little contact with them and so 
that'd be about the 
okay where are we 
i will start asking you questions so that 
yeah okay 
uh 
eh 
convenient 
in what way 
uhhum 
right right 
tremendous demand right now 
uhhum 
uhhum 
and you've been going to ohio state that whole time 
you should be getting pretty near 
excuse me 
i'm guessing 
is it 
right 
sounds good 
oh i 
yeah exactly 
i was just wondering how could i get a job doing what you're doing 
i  
grew up in masillon ohio i'm the oldest of five children 
i have four children my own 
i'm uh 
i was 
i was married many years ago 
and then i've been married to my husband now for twenty one years 
and we have um 
three children together so i have a daughter  eight 
daughter at 
nineteen who's a sophomore at ohio wesleyan my older daughter's a graduate from ohio 
i'm a graduate of  
i have a son who's 
uh  uh  see joe is 
he 
fifteen he's a sophomore at 
high school and i have an 
eighth grade daughter 
at  
and um i'm a homemaker i have a degree in sociology 
i've been at home since my 
a second daughter was born 
with my second marriage 
and i consider it a luxury and a privilege and i just absolutely love 
being at home i do a lot of volunteer work 
um 
i'm real involved with the school system 
with columbus public 
and uh 
i like 
organizing big projects for them um 
my husband's director of engineering for liebert 
and so that's why i know what you're thinking yeah 
and whenever i complain about the weather in columbus he always says we will go anywhere you want 
where would you like to live 
well i wanna stay here i don't wanna go anywhere yet til all my kids are ready 
and then my daughters always say 
okay mom as soon as we're all done with school 
then we can all move to california but we have to go as a group because i'm real real close to 
to my children 
yeah really close 
i 
i'm sure it makes it 
easier 
but i think that a person can establish a relationship 
you just have to put the effort into it and decide to have that relationship and so i think that even if i were working 
you know with my oldest daughter 
i worked but i arranged my life around her so that 
even though i had that degree i waited tables because when she was 
little before she started school 
i could go to work at five in the evening and she went to bed at 
seven thirty so i had her 
was with her all day 
then when she started school i switched over to lunches 
and 
so i've always arranged my life around my children 
so i have an opportunity to be with them 
they get 
better and better and better 
i  
i'm i'm really lucky um 
you know everyone's always 
crabbing about their horrible kids and 
my kids are phenomenal  we have this arrangement 
i do 
everything i possibly can to make them happy 
and they do 
everything they possibly can to make me happy 
and it's like 
um 
my my oldest girl she  
we're expecting our first grandchild here within a couple weeks 
and 
she and i 
see each other all the time my daughter who goes to  chose to live at home because she just said it was 
just a better situation for her 
and um 
it's not that these girls aren't independent and can't do it on their  
they're 
megan could my second daughter could have lived on her own from the time she was 
twelve 
i mean she's just a very very mature very driven 
the only problem she has she didn't have a job to support herself other than that she could have taken care of herself 
but 
she chooses to 
still at home and be a part of our life and um 
my son he's 
both those kids have four points i mean they really work hard in school because they know it's important and my son was uh 
he was the only  only one that was 
in seventh and eighth grade 
he 
took 
that time to do the maturing that most of his friends are doing at sixteen and so i'm really lucky 
that we had our 
difficulty at that point 
and uh 
and it was minimal 
but to me having been used to everything being perfect you know was like 
it was like for him to have 
um 
for him to not make the honor roll every time i couldn't even imagine what was happening with him 
and now he's completely back on track and doing really well 
and my eighth grade daughter is um 
she's 
my kids are involved in all kinds of different things she's real involved with theater 
um she's 
yeah everything that comes along you know she wins the science fair she  does the power of the pen 
she  is on student  they all have lots of 
different kinds of things that they're involved in 
and that i'm incredibly proud of them because they're just 
they're 
and they're really 
they're not geeky and goofy 
they're really neat 
neat kids that kids like 
so 
they're  they are they're wonderful everybody always says to me rachel i just don't know what you're doing will you come and take care of mine for me 
and it's 
it's the fact that i have a tremendous respect for my kids i mean i really value their opinions 
and i treat them everybody says your mom's weird she talks to us strange it's because i talk to them like i talk to you 
at at whatever age they are 
you know i don't 
yeah i don't talk down to kids i 
sure 
sure 
yeah over the years 
we've had 
situations like that 
you know a pregnancy here and there and things that people needed to get worked out or someone being worried about 
i uh i 
a 
neighbor being abused a child being abused and not knowing what to do with it and about it 
so yeah but you know i 
it's 
i'm just lucky i'm so lucky 
right 
oh i'm  
i'm sure of the fact that my parents um 
my mother tried  tries really hard but my 
my father was an alcoholic he was a working alcoholic so that he insisted you know he  
he could  drink on the weekends and never miss 
work etcetera 
yeah there was no problem 
and uh 
um 
but the biggest problem is the fact that 
he and i 
i um 
i i  i've always expected to have some sort of a respect from them 
and because 
they always wanted me to grow up and be 
independent and think for myself and so i'm exactly what they always said they wanted 
it's just that they can't 
handle that 
and so 
when i was in seventh grade and i got a lot 
in a lot of trouble about um the racial thing 
because uh i'm from a school where i was mostly 
white students were 
almost the minority it was a pretty even it's a very it's a low income neighborhood 
and when i in seventh grade i remember going home and saying was everybody the same and being told well of course they are 
so i went to school and told everybody i was in love with danny flowers who happened to be black 
and i got called into the office and they called in a social worker and they 
i was punished i wasn't allowed to 
uh i was grounded for the year 
and they never called this kid in i 
i then i thought this whole thing is so screwed up 
you know  
what's wrong with these people 
they kept saying that they wanted to save this  white girl because i had so much potential and uh they weren't going to let me throw my life away like this so i was 
you know it's bizarre 
and so i was always from that time on i decided these these people are all crazy 
i'm never gonna i'm never gonna be like that 
and so i have a whole lot of different values from my 
family 
and 
it's 
real hard for them because all my other siblings who are younger 
are willing to 

go along with what my father thinks and says and if he 
wants it a certain way why 
you just don't question that and i just 
don't do 
that it's wrong 
uhhum 
uhhum 
right 
right  
he would go for weeks he would get mad at me and not speak to me when i was growing up for a week or two at a time my mother would say 
please 
i changed my name when i went to college i just decided i'm out of here i'm everything's gone 
and so 
she would say um nancy please just talk to your father just for 
just for my sake 
please  
and i would think i'm the child here i shouldn't have to be the one to make peace in this family if he doesn't wanna talk to me 
i don't need him i don't have to talk to him 
yeah 
right 
right you know 
yeah yeah yeah i shouldn't have to do this 
i'm not responsible for the happiness of this family 
and the fact that i recognized all that and couldn't wait to get out of there and when i was gone 
i was gone 
and and even now we still have this ongoing thing where 
my  in fact i've been happy about them lately because 
um 
i've well we've lived in our same house for twenty years 
and my parents say they 
live in florida they um 
i mean they're not well to do by any means but they  they're not lacking for anything 
and they can afford to take plane trips and they can afford to go to california 
twice a year 
to  
they spend a week with my brother 
etc etc and they come here a couple times a year 
and they stay at my sister's house 
they have only come to my home three times in twenty years 
and that's because they don't wanna get off the freeway 
they will drive through columbus 
from 
florida to go to visit people in 
in 
akron and masillon and they stay in cincinnati and they stay in springfield with my sisters 
and they won't do it because 
it's just to  they don't wanna have to 
deal with that traffic 
they don't like that 
and it's 
and just recently i finally said 
you know 
i don't understand why you can't do that you know i've actually called them 
i'm fifty two 
you would think by now you know 
this wouldn't matter 
and my youngest daughter when i was 
crabbing about it because i said i talked to them and they said well we're coming to ohio in a couple weeks and i said 
oh good are you gonna come and see us 
um 
well no we weren't 
we weren't planning on it and i said well why 
well we're we're not driving uh doty's renting us the car 
well 
all that meant was my sister was renting the car 
but 
he was driving the car 
yeah 
i said well well well then how are you gonna get to these other places 
and normally i wouldn't do that i would just 
let it go 
well uh uh uh doty's renting that car and i said well are you 
aren't you driving it 
well well yeah but and i said 
fine 
and i don't wanna even think about it 
so it's kind of like 
it's just bizarre 
uhhum 
right 
and why what   he's too busy 
yeah he doesn't have the  mine don't have the time 
but they 
but then in the very next breath they said 
well in two weeks we're going to california to visit paul 
now 
now 
and anyhow i was telling each of my children because i was upset and i was telling them this 
and they're all going oh mom  my older girls are going oh you know 
and my 
my 
daughter who's thirteen is 
fabulous she is so blunt 
she is such 
she's just so 
out there and so 
different from so many other children 
um 
and she said well do you actually care if he comes here 
you don't care do you and i said 
well i don't care but it makes me feel bad it hurts my feelings 
uh 
i should know 
i  
i don't really care why should i 
yeah but it's but you still just think 
because i'm thinking too 
so what happens when they die 
am i gonna be feeling bad that this and i 
but i can't my sister said look you know you're not gonna change 
and i'm not 
the reason he won't come to my house is because when he goes to their house 
everything changes 
they have to have dinner 
at ten o clock in the morning 
we're not doing that 
we're gonna compromise and we will do it at one o  we will do it at noon 
we have dinner at 
seven o clock 
at night right we will do it at noon 
i'm not doing it at ten o clock in the  
i don't 
care 
and there's no compromise with him 
you have 
yeah 
whatever you want sure 
right so they don't come see me and i guess i shouldn't care because i 
i would just like them 
actually what i'd like them is come for about twenty minutes so they can see this wonderful home we have 
that's all i care about i just wanna show it off 
you know it's like 
look 
you always think i could 
you know look i'm doing really well look how wonderful everything is 
and wouldn't you like them to see that 
you know look 
i  really and it's bizarre 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
right 
yeah 
aw 
yeah 
i know 
i know 
i know 
i mean 
i sort 
well that's just it that's part of it because like i 
see my parents wouldn't come my mother used to try to come to things at school when i would 
be 
in different things 
and and i really did  but my father would not he just  
she'd say well you know 
he just doesn't like that kind of thing 
i mean i would be in the sunny spelling bee i would be in the 
he he doesn't 
well too damn bad get your butt down there and pretend like you like it 
and so you know with our  and my husband's the same way his family was  
his father died when he was 
nine 
he was like the adult in his family he came from a 
buffalo new york 
working class 
he left he never looked back either 
and so it's kind of like he and i are  
people always 
they 
say you know 
how we're such 
i 
i don't know we get a 
the schools are always so grateful to 
us because 
we organized the state chess tournaments he started the baseball league for this building you know he he does a lot of stuff i do a lot of stuff 
and 
it's simply because 
we're so grateful to have this family to be able to be a 
part of these kids' lives 
and 
to go to  i mean he c a h s baseball he c a h s 
you know um basketball 
we don't miss anything you know it doesn't matter what it is 
we're 
because 
we wanna be because it's a privilege 
not because 
oh i gotta go to another play 
you know my daughter just did a play downtown with columbus junior theater 
and 
i ushered at eighteen performances 
because i could see it free 
i  i didn't wanna pay ten bucks every time to see it but if i ushered 
i could be in the audience every time 
you know and for my parents to have no interest in seeing 
seeing  play baseball or  swims for ohio wesleyan you know or 
in a play 
they they wouldn't they don't even wanna be bothered with that that's just to them it's just 
and i can't understand that 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
oh it will be 
sure 
sure 
yeah exactly 
right 
uhhum 
uh huh 
timer 
yeah 
uh huh 
right 
right 
right 
yeah 
i know oh it gives me goose bumps it's such a shame 
i know and isn't it amazing 
and 
yeah 
right 
i know 
and you know and the thing is you're gonna have a 
a great time with your kids and it's just 
it's it's 
it's almost like 
if it had to be like that for me to realize it and have it like this it's worth it 
yeah 
yeah 
it's just 
it's just 
wonderful i know like saturday we're gonna drive to oberlin to watch  swim two events 
and come back 
so 
yeah she says mom i'm only gonna be in the water five minutes total why are you guys driving to oberlin ohio for this 
because we wouldn't miss it there will be a time when we  well you know she won't be doing those things 
so it's 
it's just important and it's 
wonderful and i just think it's just such an opportunity i'm so lucky to be able to do that 
see now like my husband 
i'm eleven years older than he is 
so when we got married 
we had to 
we were we were together a year we were engaged a year and we knew we 
soon as he finished school 
we were getting um within three months 
we got married bought a house was pregnant with megan 
and it's just like been 
so 
for him too uh this has been you know uh 
uh a real  road because by the time he was twenty eight he had four kids 
and 
you know 
and 
and yet you know we managed to to work through all that together and be with these kids and have this this kind of time we have now he's looking forward to 
he's thrilled about the  the baby that my daughter's gonna have 
but um 
i would have had a whole lot more kids you know i would have just kept having them and 
he said oh four's plenty you know he needed a break 
so 
now i'd be taking in foster  i  i raised a little boy from the time he was born till he was six well he was my friend's 
she's a single woman and she wanted to  
but she said she wouldn't adopt 
if she  he was gonna have to  a child would have to go to day care 
and this was when my daughter was started kindergarten and i said 
if you get a baby 
i will take care of him til he starts school 
and that's what we did 
and so he's just like my own too now i go and volunteer at he's in kindergarten i go and volunteer in his classroom too so it's kind of like 
i hope i get to do this forever 
oh i think it 
i would do it in a minute but my family doesn't want it they all 
my husband thinks we're fine he doesn't want anymore around 
and all my kids are so used to all their own 
uh they say 
oh no we don't want 
or i'd say let's get a foreign exchange student this would be fun 
they say 
no mom we don't wanna do that because they don't wanna have to be responsible for them 
at school and wherever 
so 
i don't know but if everybody's ever gone i'm gonna i will 
i will 
find some i'm sure 
i'm i'm gonna keep doing the same stuff you know i will find some other kid somewhere else and i will have some time you know my husband and i will have time together and 
i 
i always find some i always have a project 
you know it's like 
i'm always saying 
well when things slow down around here i'm gonna like right now i should be home counting money for the 
i  i did a fundraiser for the the school  we 
raised um 
we just sell 
uh morley candy and wrapping paper and all that kind of stuff 
and our sales are anywhere from twenty five thousand to forty thousand dollars and so we get half of that for the profit and i do that sale myself but that also means 
that 
i have thousands and thousands of dollars to sort through and reconcile 
so but anyhow i'm always saying when it slows down but then i always will find another project 
so 
and i 
rehab houses 
whenever i get a chance i like to do that 
so 
yeah 
no  
it's like 
you buy it and then you'd get to do the shopping the fun part you go out pick out wallpaper and cabinets and all this and that and then you have somebody else do that 
but i don't do like 
major 
gutting or anything 
i just 
like to get something that needs 
that that that i can have a vision i can usually see this can be really fabulous 
if you take care of this bathroom and kitchen and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah 
so that's the kind stuff and i've only done three or four of them but it's fun 
because i've always liked to fix up  
my own house 
yeah 
yeah it's fun 
uh huh 
uh huh 
right 
right 
uhhum 
yeah 
uhhum 
too much 
yeah 
that's what you want 
yep 
yep 
oh yeah 
uhhum 
isn't that fun 
oh i know it's so much fun 
yeah 
yeah i just like doing it and 
i have a good set i my  best friend is a realtor uh she's since retired but 
it's so funny because she would always go through  these 
statistics and this and that because it the stuff i've done is in  
and 
and because i live in  area 
and so 
she would say oh i don't know and she'd say well how much do you have to get it for and how much should 
and i would say 
oh i don't know i think if i get it for under a hundred and five i probably can sell it for a hundred and forty if i do this this this and this 
now you're gonna put a lot of money into that though it's not like you're you're still only gonna make maybe ten thousand dollars profit 
but um 
and she would say 
well i don't know and for a long time she was always real skeptical because i would just like make up these numbers or just have this idea 
and finally she says oh well rachel 
i don't know it always works out for you you always get that so just 
do it and it's just some 
intuition kind of thing 
but it's fun 
uh huh me too years ago 
i know that's 
i know 
i 
it's so funny that's what my daughters i do we're  then we're always looking and saying 
hmm there could do this this this this 
yeah 
and plus 
it is and plus the thing is too like when we bought our house we had looked for 
months and months and months and i wanted an old house 
it was built like nineteen seventeen 
i wanted an old house that hadn't been 
kept up 
yeah the same thing you were talking about and uh we're only the third people to live in it 
and so 
it needed 
everything you know and it had gold  now gold's back but in those days everything was like gold and you know and 
green it was horrible 
and uh 
it was great fun 
we had 
we had lot fun we 
we took the back porch and made it part of the kitchen and had another back porch put on uh 
finished the third floor and added a family room and another bedroom we put an in ground pool and 
so 
i always joke because what i paid for it 
i now owe three times that amount 
on it 
but it's because 
most people would have sold it and moved to a more expensive home and had a bigger mortgage 
so it's just that kind of thing 
if you have specific questions we're never get to them 
ok 
it  it only took um the last one i did was on richards road which is right across from whetstone park 
and 
it only took 
um 
less than two months 
yeah and i had sold within  
well i waited i knew that what had to have happen on the outside which is really only some paint uh 
minor painting painting the columns and adding shutters and 
cleaning up the front yard and then we have 
there's a guy who works for me who's um 
i just don't know how he can  how he makes a living because he's very very reasonable he's also very loyal to me he's done stuff for me for years 
and uh 
and he's not that old he's probably 
he's 
twenty eight or twenty nine now but anyhow pat went in 
we added a bathroom there was a mud room we added a half bath off the kitchen and 
we put in the uh changed the back door and put in the deck and 
he did those kinds of things 
and 
you know and then we were ready to go and i said i was gonna sell it myself and everybody said i was crazy 
and i had an open house 
and i sold it that day i had thirty i had 
like thirty some people in i got my offer that afternoon i got what i wanted 
well i didn't get immediately 
the realtors told me i should ask a hundred thirty four and i asked a hundred forty six instead because i really 
felt 
i  
i knew that this was nice house and i knew it had beautiful hardwood floors built in bookcases 
and i just knew that 
that i could have seen me wanting that house and do you know what i mean it's like that identity thing 
and so 
somebody came through and they 
uh with a realtor and they made me this 
offer that was real low it was like a hundred and thirty 
eight 
and 
the the realtor it's i'm thinking about it because was funny he delivered the offer to my home and i was gracious and i thanked him and i got inside and i opened up and i 
saw it 
and i went running out a porch i say 
wait a minute 
this is 
never gonna work 
i said this will never work 
i'm not interested 
take it back 
and he said 
no no no just 
let's just work with us just work with us we will we will take care of this 
so i ended up selling to him for hundred and forty four 
but it was just funny because i thought 
he 
i thought 
they're never gonna get to where i have to be and we're not even gonna play this game back and forth 
so and it was fun and i 
i made uh we made about 
nine thousand on it by the time we were done 
uhhum 
right 
right 
um i 
i um 
i do all of our own taxes i really 
i keep thinking i must be doing it wrong because it's not that hard everybody acts like oh this is such a big deal 
you just get the booklets 
you call you 
ask the questions 
yeah and you read it 
yeah 
yeah exactly i know 
really 
yeah exactly 
excuse me 
all you do is you just keep your records of  um 
you know 
what you spend on things 
and then there's a form you fill out and how much 
you have if you've taken any depreciation you know you need to 
basically put that back in 
and deduct your costs 
and then there's the percentage that goes on your schedule e that goes on the front of your form that goes into your income 
and then it's just taxed 
it's just not it's really not that hard 
it i 
i don't know how to tell you that um 
i mean it it 

well 
you know it 
because i have to think about how it went back into our income with everything else 
but 
i'm sure 
i'm sure that i didn't pay more than three thousand on it 
and 
it 
you know it didn't cost me more than three thousand and so 
if i had five or six thousand dollars out of it i was happy 
i mean 
i mean that's 
that's a lot of money for having a good 
you know 
so i almost bought one 
um uh 
couple weeks ago 
in fact i went 
i went into contract on it with this guy 
this dear old man whose it was for his mother who was in her nineties in a retirement home was on royal forest 
which is north 
and 
i made this 
this low offer and i never thought that they would 
i didn't want it was kind of like i felt like i had to do this because i 
if i was gonna get this house i should get it 
but i didn't really want now because of the baby coming and we're gonna be busy and i didn't wanna get involved in 
and so i made this offer and then he 
back you know i offered him ninety  
and he was asking ninety nine nine 
so he countered back at ninety six and i said that 
and you know i thought well good now i don't worry about he's never gonna come to it 
so i wrote back and said you know 
i appreciate your offer but 
ninety two 
i 
ninety two is is almost not feasible for me and ninety two five was 
really the only thing i could  
i could do 
and i didn't even give him a time to respond because i just just assumed i was just 
bowing out of it 
i 
checked my fax machine the next day it says 
my mother has decided accept your offer and i thought 
shit i don't 
what am i gonna do now so 
i ended up talking him and i 
i just explained to him that 
um he'd caught me off guard and that i had more time to reconsider it 
and that because of 
and it's true because my daughter went to the doctor and the doctor had said that that point the baby could be here in two weeks and that it was 
just 
not gonna work 
for me 
he's a nice man i 
felt bad 
and so then i gave him 
ideas about how he could sell it 
to help him 
well i always assume you'd be running it that whole time 
i mean i 
see 
the thing is 
ideally 
i would rather if i were gonna buy house in clintonville to hold them and rent them 
my problem is 
i don't have any money so 
i 
that down 
has to be ten percent down 
and so that means that i would have that tied up 
while it was being rented 
like we bought a couple condos over on bethel road 
it's for my kids to live in so that my oldest girl when she's getting ready to move out she's like 
twenty four 
and  they couldn't find any place to live that i thought was 
that that i felt was safe and that was acceptable 
i finally decided well 
we will find something and i will buy and i will be your land lady and then what will it will be nice 
and so 
i bought that one and then my other daughter wanted to 
was thinking she was gonna move out when she graduated from high school 
and changed her mind so i just rented that one but it the bottom line is 
i 
i just got a second mortgage and i have a guy that i work 
with that helped me 
buy those without any money 
i didn't have a down payment i had nothing 
so 
so it's like i can afford to hang on to those because the rent 
just makes the payment 
but the other you would 
you would be fine you be renting it you wouldn't buy anything that you didn't think you could rent 
and come out even with 
um hum 
it's gotta be hard if you haven't 
had other projects 
uh huh 
yeah 
wow 
yeah 
yeah 
right 
right 
yeah 
you're 
right 
it 
right 
i keep  
oh i wanna go back and 
some classes you know i keep thinking i'd go back to school but i 
even narrow down what i would wanna 
there's so much stuff 
there's so many areas that are interesting to me 
yeah 
oh i know 
yeah 
right 
that's exactly how i am when you said what would i do you know i might do house i might do  go to school some i used to own a gallery i might do something like that again 
you know there's just like 
there's just zillions of projects out there waiting to happen and so it's just 
it was 
we had a little gallery um 
we were in clintonville for a 
a year or so and then we moved to grandview 
and it was just fine art 
we called it fine art 
crafts 
and it was handmaid stuff from local 
and we had lot of jewelry and pottery and 
silk 
and paintings that kind stuff 
it was it was fun 
i met a lot of neat 
in fact that's where i met the woman whose child i took care of she was one the artists who came to me 
it but it was not 
nobody was gonna make any money on it 
and it was the kind of thing that 
it was a project i started it when my youngest daughter started kindergarten because i needed a new project 
and i didn't know 
anything about it 
i'd never even been in a gallery 
i thought 
uh 
this will be fun 
i will just rent this space because i found this space and i was trying think of something i could do with it 
so i thought well i will rent this space 
then ah 
i know what i will do 
i will just put an ad in the paper and i will find a bunch of artists and then i will set this business up 
so 
and it was consignment so i didn't needed that money i just needed rent 
and we had art classes and that was fun 
and so 
once i got that whole thing all set up and all ready to go 
it's not nearly as interesting once you know you 
i like i like to make it  
i'm not really 
interested in just sitting there day after day waiting for somebody to come  and so 
when the lease was up on high street i was gonna get rid of it 
and a couple people came to me that were artists there and said 
could we 
you know would you consider having some partners 
and i said sure if you guys are willing to come and sit in this place and i don't come sit here so we moved to grandview 
and it was doing 
much better over there 
then the 
happened 
attorneys who were next door to us decided they wanted our space and when our lease 
was up 
they had more money than we did so 
we were gonna have to move  and i just said 
this is not worth it 
and 
that i was ready that was about 
three four years into it 
i was ready to do 
else 
and i had already started taking care of jesse then so 
i used to take him down to the gallery with me and i had a little bassinet in the  and 
people 
a baby 
yeah you just find it 
i can do anything i want  
do you 
see i don't care at 
all about  i don't even drive 
but go on 
uh huh 
you need 
uh huh 
uh huh 
right 
it's just challenge to figure out how to make something work or how to 
i'm 
just incredibly optimistic i mean i really 
feel like 
um 
whatever happens to me i really it's it's my responsibility to 
you know help it happen take care of it deal with it 
you know i'm but i 
have a backup  
you know or whatever's going on i always have to have a backup plan though 
and then i know well if this happens this will  and if 
doesn't happen this way then 
is what we will do instead 
uh huh 
does your husband like that 
oh mine drives him crazy 
oh yeah 
yeah 
that's true 
sure 
uh huh 
uh huh 
oh yeah uh i'm not i haven't learned to stop myself too much yet i 
i 
i think we have this 
this thing of  um 
logistics 
and in efficiency and it's kind of like okay now let's see if you 
if you if this is what has to happen 
we're able to order 
the sequence 
of like i see people doing things like 
and it has to do with 
driving thing too 
like driving 
from place to place to place to place to place to place for  
i mean 
why the hell don't you  
and find out if they even have it 
you know decide where you're going why do you just waste all your time running around like that 
i know it ever forever 
you know and another thing is 
are the 
friends of mine are always 
you know 
could you 
my business for me like like could i do their checkbook course i'm not gonna do their checkbook but just like to show them how to 
in 
because i have a real good sense of 
you know how things have to be and it's just 
my  and i are 
very different 
we're just we're very different but 
we have 
we're really 
lucky we have fabulous relationship 
and 
you know and he's real grateful and appreciative and he said as 
long as 
he appreciates you know like 
he will come home and 

oh you vacuumed 
oh it's so nice in here thank you you know and 
and 
that's 
good you know there are a lot of people out there that uh wouldn't even notice the  
course then there are the days when i don't get around to it i know he must 
right 
right 
it's 
it's amazing and 
that's something i know my husband we always joke about he talks tells his guys at work you know 
like um 
you know to take flowers for no reason you know well like like one guy was telling he was saying something about it was their anniversary and peter said well are you gonna take flowers home and he guy goes 
oh i don't know and pete said 
trust me 
some flowers 
this will be  
and 
and the guy came back next time and he said 
yeah i had a real good weekend you know was a good 
and it's true 
if you show each other over and over that they're really you're really value them 
it just 
back to you 
yeah 
right 
right 
right 
and then they wonder  
you know i don't know 
it's the other 
who's changed you know and if you  you start 
your behavior you can usually get the kinds of changes i always figure if you treat people the way 
that old golden rule thing 
if you if you give out what you want back you get it 
it sure works for me 
yeah 
yeah 
uhhum 
uh huh 
yeah 
right 
right 
uhhum 
right 
oh what are you doing that for oh 
that's funny 
right 
right 
well see 
we have real traditional 
um 
break down of  of chores but only because 
that's just happened to be 
what we like to the way we like it do you know what i mean 
and it's it's not 
um 
because 
you know i consider our 
my whole house a lot of feminists you know we're all real strong about that but the thing is 
since i have the luxury of being at home 
and peter  doing a job that 
really enjoys 
and i am doing something i enjoy 
i really am happy to do 
all of those things that typically women do 
because 
that's my job that's my trade off you know i don't have to go someplace else i can get 
i can go and have coffee everyday with my daughters i can go  
do whatever i want 
and i'm happy to do these other things 
and so 
you know even though it turns out to be the real traditional breakdown 
it's not 
it's not because i 
to 
it's not because he you know he wouldn't do something that that something else 
it's 
this suits me fine 
and so that's a whole different that's real different from the way it used to be even though it looks the same 
right 
which is what we look like 
but it's not 
right 
right 
uhhum 
right 
exactly 
right 
right 
right 
right 
i 
that's another thing that 
that 
we're i'm at odds with with my 
were that they don't understand the fact that why would i go to college 
i 
for it myself 
i worked my way through school 
i was so proud the fact that i was like only a quarter late 
than my actual schedule to graduate which is pretty amazing given the fact that i was paying for it 
as i went 
and and i didn't have any loans i was when i was done it was 
for 
and so um 
course tuition was a hundred twenty five dollars a quarter but i was only making you know fifty cents an hour at the beverly across the street on neil avenue 
so um 
uh but 
anyhow you know they 
never understand you know well you  
you never got a job with it 
you know why would you go to school and waste all that money 
i it was the best money i ever spent 
i don't  i mean and 
it was my money 
why should it matter 
right 
well why do you have to do 
anything with it 
yeah 
yeah 
right but still 
my  my oldest daughter were for a long time she was  
in 
and 
would say to me how do you feel about that and i said what do you mean how i feel about that 
you know 
she can always wait tables as long as she can 
herself 
self what do i care 
and then she ended up getting an undergraduate degree in psychology 
and now as it turns out she's going to um 
she just started back she's the one that's having the baby though 
she's just started back  and uh 
to get certified to teach elementary 
school because we've 
talked so much about 
what  where would she do well and she 
she would just do so well she's really good  she's such a 
herself she's really good with with kids maybe second third grade she's so into animals and so into 
science and understands different kids 
so that 
you know i 
i think she would be fabulous there 
and so she's kind of decided  but if that if she  ends up not doing that 
i won't care either 
well we don't wanna know she's the only one that wants to know her her um boyfriend 
doesn't wanna know either and so sara decided that she could not go 
and find out the sex of it because she couldn't keep a secret yeah so 
so anyhow we don't we just don't know 
it's due december second but she's already dilating and everything so the doctor had said before thanksgiving he thinks you know 
we're excited 
it will be fun 
in any pregnancy three weeks in either direction is considered full term 
yeah 
so  
she's funny because she's gained twenty six pounds and yet she doesn't look pregnant 
she has on 
she had on a regular 
sweater today 
and it's she's kind of big chested she's my height 
but the baby is like all  you don't 
it 
i mean 
unless you push her shirt down 
it's just like it's 
it's just amazing to me to be that pregnant and not be able to even hardly look like it 
so 
oh really 
yeah 
yeah a little yeah it's just amazing when she went to her lamas class she said 
mom you wouldn't believe it 
half these uh they 
get up off the floor or anything they were all having trouble and she said there i was with my cupcakes and my cheetohs you know and she said they all had bottled water and were very you know 
but she's 
like i said she just turned twenty eight she's 
so 
i don't know i she doesn't move anymore than she has to i'm the one that loves to exercise 
oh i do some yoga 
and i do some 
some weights 
and i have a stepper 
that i absolutely love i can 
i have it down now so i can 

listen to music 
read the paper 
and have the tv on if there's something i think i might wanna  
i might be interested in so i just 
do all those things and 
do my machine 
uh just at home 
i just have a tape that i use it's kathy smith 
one of her 
things that i really like 
yeah 
uhhum 
where do you do the aerobics 
yeah 
really 
i think that step would be really fun i've never done it but it always looks like so much fun to me 
really 
wow  
yeah i know 
well i 
believe me i know 
yeah 
right 
right 
my  
yeah because my friend has some place where she even teaches yoga and has she's real involved in it 
that she goes to um 
the one that i told you who's the realtor 
but i should find out 
that 
if i find out i will let you know 
because i know she 
she goes to some place called crapala in pennsylvania from time to time and 
who knows 
i just 
i don't really do it for the meditation or anything 
i just do it for the stretching it's almost like when i'm laying there and  and kathy's saying 
you know take 
even though i sound speedy 
i'm really relaxed as much as weird as that might seem you know and so for me that's like 
okay come on 
i don't really want i don't want time to do this kind of relaxing stuff 
i just wanna get going and do the rest of this 
so 
the part of it no 
its takes about fifty minutes but to do all the stretching 
because see 
well i've had five babies you know i really have to work when you talked about that 
the older you get 
i have to work  really hard to 
stay in halfway decent shape 
so 
but i love it 
yeah i think it does 
but 
it 
i like to exercise 
i think it's fun i would just do it four hours a day if i could do that 
although i haven't for the last 
six weeks i haven't done anything because it's just i've had these other things that are  
that are really pressing 
you know how that is you get you have some things you just have to get done 
and then when i get this stuff cleared out 
there will be a break 
and then i will be able to go back to it 
uhhum 
oh wow 
that must be 
uhhum 
oh 
right 
right 
yeah 
now who does he work for 
oh 
well i was because i was gonna say when you were talking about traveling 
you will be able to get him to have  
a job where he can do lots of traveling 
i know um like my husband goes to europe and 
goes you know he goes to california every month 
and 
and 
you know he goes as 
little as possible 
but the point is 
if i  
if we wanted to be traveling 
he could be going a lot more 
a lot longer now he just goes for 
you know a couple days 
at a time just to get back here because i don't like him to have to  well and he doesn't wanna be away from us 
but  
your husband you will be in a position you can he can latch on to something where you will be able to have lots of opportunities to travel 
you will 
uhhum 
uhhum 
yeah 
right 
right 
it is it's 
right 
well i know with myself when we had 
pete always says that 
it wasn't for me he would have gotten just too immersed in his job because he is really involved you know he likes what he's doing 
he has tremendous responsibility and 
but he loves it but the thing is 
when the  were little too you know i was always having to pull him back and say 
don't forget 
you know 
they're gonna grow up fast if you if you don't spend this time 
and now 
i mean 
like i said the youngest is thirteen and so he's been at this for all these years and 
i don't have to do that anymore i mean 
someplace along the way about ten years ago 
he got so involved in their lives but when they're little 
it's a real different thing i mean you can understand why 
it'd be more pleasant for him to be at work all those hours  you know you have these little babies crying and all this stuff going on but 
he used to always 
he would come home from work 
and then go back to work after they were in bed 
so that i wouldn't have to deal with it the whole time 
and work later then 
which was fine by me 
or he'd call and he'd say 
is it okay if i work a little late  would you care if i stayed here a couple more hours which i think is really nice there are a lot of men that 
wouldn't even think about asking 
uhhum 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
sure 
right 
right 
oh and i've 
and i'm sure it will 
especially when you already recognize that 
you know  if if you already know in advance what kinds of things you're gonna be 
uh helping along it's a lot easier than 
trying to figure out what's going on here you know 
uh huh 
yeah 
right 
uh 
i 
that's certainly possible there are lots of ways that my brain 
doesn't 
people's do 
so i think  
i think a lot of it too has to 
to 
do with being comfortable with yourself and knowing 
you know i mean i've gotten so much better over the years i was very 
i've always been real 
lot more temperamental 
we always joke you know that 
that predictable and 
some of those things are not 
um 
even tempered are not things you would use to describe me 
but 
but  not in a negative 
negative way you know i just think that as i've gotten older too i've been able to see things and not be so 
get so concerned about things that 
that really weren't that important anymore 
so 
i don't know just lucky 
i know i was thinking that before when you were telling me stuff 
yeah 
right 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah i  i you know i think too i apologize to my oldest daughter 
every day about the poor thing all i put her through when 
we were trying to grow up together and i was twenty four when she was born so i wasn't a child 
but it's like 
you don't have realistic expectations 
of what 
what children are capable of or what they can do because if they're really verbal 
and my kids always have been really verbal because i've talked to them from the moment they were born 
even  you know when they couldn't talk to me that was irrelevant 
i was talking to them the whole  obviously 
see i don't shut up 
so i would talk to them the whole time and 
so they would always be really verbal and so it seemed like they   
had a much better understanding and could do things better than 
they really could like when my daughter was about five we got a hamster 
and i said well you know you make sure you give it food and water 
and when it died it  
i was so surprised that she hadn't given him been giving it food and water because she did it occasionally but to a five year old you don't 
yeah they don't get that stuff together 
or when she was eleven we sold her bedroom furniture and i gave her the money to keep so she could  wait to buy something else well within 
three or four months it was gone you know and so then the next year and a half she only had a mattress on the floor in her room because 
but i mean now that was bizarre 
now 
with my other kids first of all i would have better sense than to do those things or i  
i would take more responsibility rather than expecting them to have it 
and secondly 

if that happened 
i would be ten times more understanding and i would say 
you know i would accept responsibility for them being in a position to make those mistakes 
and 
yeah 
i yeah i shouldn't have done that so now let's just go get some more furniture 
do you know what i mean 
and and she always says oh mom it was fine she said 
i got to do 
a whole lot of things you won't let them do now 
for that now that i know better 
so  she she's always very generous about it and says she had more time alone with me and 
because 
i got divorced when she was or her 
i split up with her dad when she was about a year and a half 
and so for until she was six it was just she and i 
so we had a lot of time together and she says she thinks that was worth it 
it was okay to put up with my trying to learn how to be a parent 
in exchange for having me all to herself 
in a   i  
oh my god 
oh 
well see 
my  my husband would do that though 
it's so bizarre because  is 
i don't know what's 
i  
i honestly don't i think that's where his brain is completely lacking 
i make i get to make 
all the decisions at my house about 
discipline and about what people can do and can't do 
and we 
all understand this and it's perfectly fine 
and he says 
i'm not a good judge of that 
you will have to check  because my son when my son was like eleven 
he let him come to campus with his skateboarding friends i said where are they 
oh they said they were going down on  
i said 
on campus 
over my dead body 
he's not allowed down there 
and so 
it's the thing is though 
it's almost like 
i'm really glad that  willing to say 
i just can't make those  uh he'd let 
he'd let my daughter who's  he left 
left her at the movies one night 
they went to the movies there was no um 
the movie they went to see was sold out 
the next one wasn't gonna start until nine thirty which means this kid's 
years old 
so that would have been eleven thirty twelve  you know 
at the lennox he leaves her there with one of her friends 
some boy 
and 
although  this tom-boy who's just amazing but so anyhow uh he left her there 
and 
uh 
they said they called me but i  i was running the sweeper so i didn't hear the phone 
so  left her there and he said that she was gonna call back you know at at a certain time and i was gonna tell her what she could or couldn't do 
so i said you know well you're gonna have to come  home you know he's gonna have to come and get you oh come  no 
we're not gonna do that i you know you can't be this late 
so he went back down 
picked them  
and i said let the kid come to our house he can come here until eleven 
then his parents can pick him up 
and everybody was annoyed my husband said 
i would've let her stay i don't understand why you're doing this 
i don't care 
i want her to come home 
the other 
well the bottom line it was hysterical because 
she and this little boy they're outside and he they're jumping and he's jumping on the trampoline i go out to him and i introduce myself and i say you know honey i said 
really sorry about the plans but 
i just you couldn't  
i just could not let you  her stay there that long he goes 
oh that's okay my mom would never let me do that 
so and i'm thinking you know 
here's  everybody's acting like i'm the bad guy 
and 
i'm i'm the one who's into 
right 
and so 
there  i just wanna tell you one more thing that was funny because 
um there was something  she wanted to skip a play rehearsal that i wouldn't let her skip 
because 
it was for a party that her friends were having 
and i understood it was important to her but when you have commitments you  you keep your commitments 
and so 
was saying he agreed with me and i said look even your dad thinks that in this case 
she goes 
so what's with him 
he never has an opinion 
how come all of a sudden he's allowed to have an opinion tell me what i can do you know it was really funny 
we laughed about it and 
i let her um 
i let her skip 
because i decided that it was so important to her 
so 
yeah 
but it was just so funny you know 
i know we talked too long but this is so much fun 
do you have a three o'clock 
we gotta  
okay 

ok 
uhhum 
uhhum 
great 
uhhum 
sure 
um 
i grew up in lima ohio 
and which is only about an hour and half from here 
north 
i came here in 
nineteen ninety one i believe 
here being columbus 
um i got married about three years ago 
and right now i'm in the process of 
doing a little bit of everything i've worked all my life 
um until about the 
past 
two years 
and i've just been working like part time 
and um doing crafts and things like that 
because i've always been like in the financial 
analytical end and 
the other side of my brain wants some work 
so really that's about it i have a dog 
he's outside right now and that's it 
for my kids 
yeah 
um really anything 
like right now i'm just painting and 
um they laugh at me because i went the other day and found some chairs that were 
that 
badly 
and asked if i could have them cleaned them up 
and i'm painting those and things like that 
so 
no 
no 
yeah 
i gave them to my sister and my mom and stuff like that 
so 
yeah 
it's kind of fun 
uhhum 
yeah no that'd be neat i'd love to do that 
yeah 
right 
yeah 
that would be fun 
i'm looking for a part time job as we speak i've been like doing temporary on and off 
and the thing with that is you could work 
you know for four five months and then nothing 
and then 
just 
like that so right now i'm looking for something permanent 
uh mostly accounting 
things like that uh such as accounts receivable for nursing homes and 
things like that pretty in depth 
um 
some of the day by you know if i just go for a day it's filing and what not getting phones 
but most of the jobs actually 
you learn a lot 
so 
boy it would have to be 
um something that i actually enjoy 
um   
what happened was ever since i came to columbus 
almost every company i work for was bought out and sold and moved to a different state 
and i wasn't interested in that 
uh because my husband works for the state 
so obviously he's not going anywhere 
um 
so i got tired of that and that's why i kind of went to temping and stuff 
so it'd be one with a variety 
um 
i'm  i say unfortunately good at accounting and stuff 
but that doesn't get to express my creative side as much so 
it would be um 
my favorite job was one where i did the accounting but i dealt with people as well 
and like 
would do presentations at seminars and stuff like that occasionally too 
so 
right 
just a teeny bit 
enough to satisfy me 
so that was good 
yeah i do 
um i prefer 
i've done it by myself but i would  prefer to do it with my husband 
and stuff 
europe 
i was there for almost a month 
did one of those tours where you get on the bus 
um 
and did the london and the france the and italy and to holland and 
germany and everything 
that was really neat 
right 
yeah 
yeah 
that's very true 
we haven't done that much yet uh because his family lives in albuquerque new mexico 
we're 
at  at least every other year we're out there 
which is great 
but it takes away that big trip 
um we've been and then his brother got married in hawaii 
so we went out there so 
we've just done the honeymoon at disney world 
the albuquerque a couple times and hawaii 
but we have plans to go to europe he he wants to go to england and 
things like that and i wanna we're looking into greece 
so 
yes 
uh actually kawai 
yeah so it was really nice 
i thought it 
course i didn't go to all of them but 
it was nice 
yeah 
and it it has the least amount of people 
which is kind of neat 
as far as tourism 
so 
yeah 
it was 
it's not bothering me but when i talk and move my head 
it's like hitting me and i just am not sure you can tell me if it's not 
anywhere near my mouth 
so 
yeah 
it's i keep it wasn't 
but then it moved so 
well 
there we go 
yeah 
hilliard 
uhhum 
i like it 
um 
i've lived 
i've only lived in the northern end i've lived in dublin 
and old worthington 
and now hilliard which is kind of around the side 
um but i like it because it has it's own little 
well especially worthington it's own little city within a city 
and um 
i think they have a lot to do 
you know the parks and things like that 
so 
um 
i will just hold it 
but i like it 
because it has art 
and culture 
and um 
it doesn't feel like a big city 
unless you get stuck in traffic 
so 
yeah 
yeah but i  
i have 
purposely tried to work close 
or do the back roads it's nice from hilliard you can get almost anywhere 
whether it be here 
or you know where i've been working 
on back roads so it's not that bad 
uhhum 
yes 
yeah 
right 
the snouffer and all that 
yep 
i used to live up there too 
so 
very much so 
yeah 
i think this year it's gonna be even worse 
stocking up 
water 
right 
yeah 
uhhum 
yes 
yes 
yes 
really 
i haven't noticed that 
yet 
huh 
yeah 
yeah 
i think it's probably too though that a lot of people haven't 
aren't used to it 
i mean they're not from ohio 
i've  
found that in columbus a lot 
so they're kind of 
you know more tentative or they're from the south or something like that 
so 
they 
and then you run into a lot of people that are from ohio but 
i've noticed that a lot of people 
rarely do you meet people born and raised in columbus 
so 
uhhum 
uhhum 
huh 
that's good 
no not really actually 
some i have and then i've run into the people that 
just like anything they wanna get out of their hometown they don't like it they complain 
but normally i find that those people 
aren't taking advantage of 
the 
you know free art shows and 
you know i mean the things that are free i'm like oh have you done this 
no i didn't even know about it and you've lived here all your life and i've only lived here x number of years and 
so 
um 
well just even like the 
parks 
or um 
like the 
art shows in worthington or the crafts or even the the irish festival in dublin 
which can be free yeah on certain days and things like that 
um 
the concerts on the river 
or on the worthington 
green 
really anything like that 
and they used to have the laser light show downtown 
they don't have it anymore 
um 
you know just even if you do one thing free a month 
it 
it doesn't have to cost anything but you 
you can go do it with your family or whatever so 
yeah 
uhhum 
yeah 

no my husband yeah he's uh he's from she can wear a bandanna but that's it 
and i you know i would love to do that with her only on things like that i wouldn't be the type that would put a sweater on her on tuesday and a little skirt on her on wednesday 
but 
i i would get a kick out of that 
um 
she 
yes 
um 
we're both 
i've gotten kind of bad uh 
but my husband's a marathon trainer 
i try to run with her at least two or three times a week because she's he's too fast for her 
um but we go to like hoffman farms 
up in  off of cosgray in hilliard i'm not sure if it's in hilliard but 
um we've taken her to the scioto part 
for the concert on the river 
we don't tend to take her to things like the art festival or the it's just too crowded 
and it's not fair to her or the other people 
uh because she has been known to help herself to bread 
we were like brain dead after this race and my husband took her and we know better but 
we were like 
you know after you run you're kind of like uh 
and she 
jumped up on the table and looked around and took a piece of bread and i'm like 
oh my gosh 
you're embarrassed 
i'm so sorry and the guy's like ah nobody else is eating it she 
she's a golden retriever 
yeah she's three so she's still puppy but she's getting there 
yeah 
uhhum 
yep 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah she did that yesterday 
so 
stomach pump 
uh 
yeah 
we've kind of broken her of that thank goodness the counter stuff 
but 
yeah 
yeah 
she's been known to do that too 
yeah 
yes 
uhhum 
sure 
do they 
uh 
that's nice 
that's good 
right 
yeah 
i've run into just a few problems at antrum 
um since i do like to jog even though i'm very slow 
most of the people that take their dogs there 
take them off the leash and let them go in the lake and what not 
which is 
you're not supposed to do that but when i'm jogging with my dog on a leash and all the other dogs come up it 
irritates me 
because you know you're trying to run and your dog's trying to greet that dog and the dog's tripping you and you're like 
i've actually been known to go am i the only one following the rules around here 
because i'm trying to run 
obviously it's hard for me to run so 
oh 
yes 
he will be 
yeah it's a week from sunday 
uhhum 
i would love to do it but 
even when i was 
my knee won't let me 
i was marathon training and i only got up to about nine miles 
and um i have 
unfortunately about fifty pounds of extra weight on me but even like i said when i was skinnier 
i have like a bum knee on distance 
i'm okay to run the lower 
but uh 
no 
you know i should 
i really should i do that with the 
without even realizing it but i haven't just because i've ran for so many years 
or 
jogged excuse me i don't 
run i'm too slow 
get the track terminology there 
yeah 
yeah that's a good idea 
uhhum 
yeah 
i have read that 
i need to try that 
just for winter even 
you don't slide as much 
that would be good 
yeah 
uhhum 
uhhum 
yeah 
yeah 
they're pretty good where i live um 
well last year when we had that really really high snow 
um i shoveled and then like an hour later it blew over 
so was like what's the 
um 
but 
our neighborhood has a lot of children 
so most of the people do shovel their sidewalk 
uhhum 
um 
about  
yeah 
did we get her 
we've had her for two years yeah 
we did about six months 
we went to hawaii and got his brother married 
and then we came back we knew that 
would be the last long trip 
um 
and we were gonna wait till the spring but we couldn't 
so we went to a rescue service and got her 
yeah 
uh 
uhhum 
uhhum 
yeah 
oh definitely 
definitely 
well i've never had dog and i've always wanted one 
so this is my first 
i'm like 
want a  
so 
yeah 
uhhum 
sure 
well that and they 
like tuesday 
when we were blessed with the turn of events of weather there 
she came in and i  i was reading a book 
and i let her out and i let her back in and i started reading again 
and i'm looking around and here's mud 
so it's kind of good in a  
because it kind of well you know 
you live here it's not the big of a deal you know because i know 
my sister would freak 
i'm like 
and 
believe it or not 
uh they're not really i wouldn't call them neat freaks but 
um 
we tease them because 
my parents and her 
live within a couple miles of each other in dublin 
you have to take off your shoes when you go in which is really 
it's amazing how good their carpet looks 
just from doing that but when you have a dog 
why bother 
um 
and they won't allow dogs 
so 
not allowed to go over there 
so she's always like 
but it does make a big difference so i guess that's what i'm saying for them 
it'd almost be better if they let the dog go over because you know she's gonna bring in mud and  and 
it's not gonna be perfect maybe knock something over 
you know 
kind of start with her but you have to go home 
you know what i mean 
to let her out and that's kind of like i mean of course a kid you can't put in a yard and 
for hours like i did this morning but 
exactly 
it would be nice but no 
um 
yeah 
yeah yeah 
i think so 
yeah 
yeah 
oh 
uhhum 
yeah 
uhhum 
yeah 
yeah to sit on it 
she's not allowed on the couch 
but 
we had caught her last winter 
on the couch 
you know you come home and it's warm and 
hey there's a doggy  
bone up here  
so we've even been known to slightly start pulling out 
you know let the garage door go down 
i'd sneak out of the car and run up to the window and knock on the window and she's on the couch and she's 
like 
i'm caught 
yeah 
oh we have fun 
anybody see that 

ours does that too 
they're great 
sounds a lot like our dog 
yeah my sister 
and her husband just moved back they went out to nebraska for a year 
and then yeah i got the opportunity um 
a company that my sister had worked for wanted her to come back 
and so they offered to move them back 
and um 
it kind of worked out because her husband was losing his job any how 
just kind of one of those okay let's do it 
and so 
um my parents retired here 
let's see 
they've been here 
i don't know four or five years maybe 
and my sister was here 
like i said and then moved out just gotten 
came back a couple months ago 
um 
my grandfather just passed away but he was here 
in a nursing home for about a year 
um 
indirectly 
yes 
um the  
my sister was here only 
when i got here 
but i was in  one of those you know youth 
stupid uh psychopathic relationships shall we say 
and i kind of needed to disappear 
and um 
uh we never told him where  she had just moved 
um 
so i just came down here then 
so 
was one of those 
things 
get away from it all yeah 
yeah so um i came down here 
because he knew where my parents lived and plus columbus was a lot more opportunity 
so indirectly it was a very bad reason that i came here 
but 
it worked out 
you know so 
right 
exactly 
oh 
uhhum 
well i even had that 
i mean my  
oh my sister said if you didn't leave him i was gonna staple your hair to the 
but um she was  she wasn't kidding though 
you know it's just one of  oh i can help him you know i've learned i'm the caretaker 
like i roll my eyes 
you can't change people that much stupid 
but um 
it's weird because it was terrible 
but because he was real controlling and you know you start to doubt yourself like 
did i say that 
right and like he wouldn't let me sleep so then you start to lose that 
you know what i mean   you  really do start to lose your mental 
yeah 
woo 
and um 
um 
you know at the time i was like i'm not gonna get anything out of this and it was misery and 
what not but 
i've met people that have been in 
much worse situations 
and at least i can kind of relate to them 
so in a  in one way it's kind of a blessing 
so 
yeah 
uhhum 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
uhhum 
yeah 
oh yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
it's very  
i my sister 
has an undergrad in psychology 
and she worked at like um 
one of those 
what do you call them those secretive houses like for women and their battered children that 
you know you're not supposed to 
location and what not 
and she used to get so frustrated um 
because they'd always go back 
and 
i understand that mentality now because i went back but i will tell you the reason i left 
sound stupid but 
he took my teddy bear 
which i loved and  had for 
not since i was a child but at least five years at that time 
and he just 
he knew i loved it 
and just took it and ripped it 
and and 
that split second i was like 
okay he's gonna do this to me he's gonna do this to my kids 
ain't no way 
uhhum 
wow 
uhhum 
yeah 
it is 
that's important 
right 
even though it's an inanimate object it all kind of came together 
right 
and i was glad i realized that i 
nobody would ever mess with my children 
not even 
their father my husband or whatever 
and i realized that so it was like ok 
i'm not gonna do it for me but 
i'm gonna do it 
for the future 
and and that helped 
because like i said it all came together because i don't understand how people can let their kids be hurt 
but 
i'm 
i'm not built that way 
yeah 
yeah 
um 
uhhum 
uhhum 
yeah 
sure 
yeah 
yeah 
uhhum 
uhhum 
yeah it's always kind of scary 
i think you really need to get away from that 
to get your self back 
or you're just gonna go back because you don't know any other way at the time 
uhhum 
yeah 
right 
right 
but that helped me just getting away getting my mind cleared 
doing a little bit of reading going wait a minute you know uh 
so obvious hello 
but 
oh yeah 
but just that freedom 
you know to do what you want to get some sleep to 
eat to take care of yourself 
to do a little investigation on your own to pray about it what not 
and then it's really clear but if you don't get that 
and you're always thrust back into it 
i don't think you can break free 
so 
yeah 
that's true 
yeah 
uhhum 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
uhhum 
uhhum 
um 
no 
which is i'm very grateful 
he did like go past my  
parents' house and things like that 
but then they moved here 
and even though it's public records like who owns a house 
um 
luckily we haven't had that because 
we purchased the house 
my husband and i 
before we were married and then moved in after we were married so the deed has my maiden name on it 
but uh no luckily 
and that's been 
almost ten years 
so hopefully 
hopefully 
no 
i'd just uh basically got out of a  
a 
a relationship 
it was like a rebound type thing 
um i was in a relationship for like three years 
and um 
he was cheating on me 
and so i felt really bad and why does he pick her and 
and then i met this guy who seemed 
wonderful 
and then 
turned out 
to be not so wonderful 
so 
i made a 
you know you look back and you see things you were like this is real obvious 
but at the time i think you  
i was like 
um 
a i can either change them 
or 
if they love me 
we can communicate 
and change things and you know 
that type of thing 
yeah 
right 
first of all they're not really in love with you and 
so when i came here 
um i didn't date 
for over five years 
on purpose 
i don't think it was supposed to be that long on purpose but i wouldn't let myself date for a couple years after just trying to figure out 
you know okay 
this is what i'm doing wrong let's not do it again 
and then 
asked me out for a few more 
yeah 
so that 
uh so i really hadn't dated for a long time and then i started dating again 
and what's weird is you almost go right back in 
to the patterns because you're so scared you're gonna be alone you see yourself going 
oh i can be with this person and you know in your head 
this 
not for  
and then luckily 
um indirectly i met my husband 
four 
four years ago i don't know it's been awhile 
four and a half years ago something like that 
so 
yeah 
yeah 
right 
yeah it was like oh this makes sense and he might have these other wonderful 
things that i'm used to but he's got all of 
so i will get that little slice and take the 
so that worked out 
um 
um 
actually i think it needs to probably start younger than that 

because 
i  
didn't 
start dating until i was almost seventeen 
but almost everybody else  
had 
even 
i'm gonna be thirty six here in a week or two 
so we're 
i graduated in eighty  
where  
i think kids are  dating at 
like 
ten 
heaven forbid 
but 
i'm sitting here going 
i mean 
i didn't even know what i was doing 
when i started dating at 
almost seventeen 
um 
so no i think 
i think you learn a lot from your family 
and the way their relationships are 
um 
i 
i personally don't think a school can do it 
um 
i think they can help 
but i think it has to be something that 
society in general or family 
unit does it 
um and it wasn't that i had a bad family unit it was just that 
there wasn't you know we never talked about it 
my 
were just talking about that because 
she goes 
we were like  
you know how did people start talking about 
and relationships and what not she goes 
you don't  mom and dad handed me a book 
i'm like they did 
i'm like i don't remember that 
and she goes well after i read the book i asked them a lot of questions so maybe they didn't give it to 
you know like how we don't wanna go through this again 
because she's a little 
i thought that was hilarious 
like 
you mean sexual relationships and what 
um 
probably the  
the bad things about it 
yeah 
um but just coming from my christian beliefs and what not 
the best thing and i know it 
even though i didn't partake in it when i was a teenager and i wasn't promiscuous at all 
but i still had sex before marriage 
um 
just to be 
it'd be nice if they teach you how to be confident in your self 
and i don't mean like self esteem but 
you know like 
we said if if uh 
you know you come from a situation like that that doesn't mean you have to be like that do you know what i mean kind of 
yeah 
right 
well kind of like 
just because everybody else is doing it this way doesn't mean it's the right  
and um 
yeah 
you know i really struggle with that 
because 
i come more from i think the family should teach it 
but let's be realistic how many families are gonna do that 
or 
have the 
mentality to do that 
it seems like um 
sound like my dad 
like these days 
most of the people a lot of people that are having kids 
shouldn't be 
and the people that 
would be decent parent aren't 
because of the 
situations and what not 
um just my  
nobody in my  my sister doesn't have kids i don't have kids 
we're in our mid to late thirties 
um our friends just had one 
um i do have some friends that have 
like more than one 
which is great 
because they're just great parents i will know those kids are gonna be going in 
but then 
i have uh other people that 
like my other friends that just had one 
were trying to help a a child  children services 
that came from 
you know 
imagine it and that's basically what happened to her and her mom had three kids 
by three different dads 
and they thought if they could get her out of that environment they actually 
had her move in with them 
they were her temporary foster parents 
and 
she just turned sixteen 
so she was fifteen when she moved in with them 
she refused to change 
and 
i don't know what could have changed it if they would have got her out earlier 
but basically 
all three of them 
i don't wanna say are doomed but 
they're not 
even though they're out of that environment 
they're not doing any better 
so 
i don't know 
yeah so it's kind of like 
i'm for education in schools but 
um 
just like the bad things about it you know 
sex can do 
you can get pregnant number one 
which isn't fun 
number two you know the diseases and things like that 
i think that's a good idea 
to teach just 
that it's not all 
uh fun and peer pressure and stuff i know i kind of got off track there but 
hum 
no 
because they're gonna learn that on their own 
um 
i personally think that it's a choice 
i don't think you're born that way 
because  i 
i have friends 
that are homosexual and 
um 
you know  i don't believe in what they're doing but 
do everything right everyday 
so i still love them and they're my friends and blah blah blah because 
but i've also known people that 
were that way 
and now are heterosexual and are much happier 
and they realize that it was just a choice they made and things like that 
um 
so it's 
in today's day and age they're gonna learn about it 
quickly 
and i don't really think it's something that needs to be taught 
um 
the only thing 
probably 
is like 
what do they call that uh 
cultural diversity or whatever classes they have us take i think 
that i don't think is such a bad idea 
uh because just because you grew up in 
i don't know 
what i grew up in but i will i will give an example i didn't grow up in let's say 
somebody goes hunting and fishing and drives trucks and wears ball caps and listens to country music 
doesn't mean if somebody doesn't do that 
they're not okay 
i think that would be a good idea or you know cultures all are different 
so if you wanted to view that as a culture or 
do you know what i mean 
that that 
is something different 
um 
accept the people you don't have to like what they're doing 
but they're still people 
so 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
um 
yeah 
i 
it's hard because i i do come  
i'm a christian 
so i believe that homosexuality is wrong 
but 
i don't like i said i'm not gonna condemn them 
um at all 
like i said i have friends 
it 
i understand what you're saying 
um 
but i think that's something more for 
the parents 
or the teacher to pick out 
that maybe that child 
um is having a problem and then send them to counseling of some sort 
and not actually incorporate it 
in a 
thirty student 
ensemble 
um 
uh it'd be nice if we had more of an open environment in schools and if teachers really had the time 
to notice that maybe somebody had a problem and talk to them about it 
and then send them on that counseling 
one on one way 
um 
just because 
if you're gonna teach it to um a large amount of 
students 
i'm not even sure if that one  student would listen because all the rest of them  probably be making cracks and just make them feel  
do you know what i mean 
i don't  
yeah 
you know they probably all hey you resemble that remark or 
so i hesitate to say that it would really help them 
um it would just be better if somebody could 
you know keep their eyes open 
or if we  
um 
more counselors or things like that to deal with everything 
including that 
normally i would say no 
but 
yeah 
i do 
just because 
let's face it 
do it anyhow 
and i would feel better for them 
and if  
if they used it because 
uh 
you know 
it's not good for the children that are born it's not good for them 
um 
i'd prefer abstinence but let's be realistic 
you know i think we're past that point now 
um i know a lot of christians argue oh but you're wrong 
well yeah i might be wrong but 
you know 
we can't go backwards on that i don't think 
you can only work on your own 
it's 
right 
is not gonna work 
right 
even though i knew better at the point 
when i 
was faced with that at seventeen or whatever 
i wanted to be  so bad that it was something that 
i 
you know what i mean 
and i knew better but you just you know 
and it's like well 
i wasn't that strong granted but 
i was probably  
the 
normal teen and 
i think most of the people i knew at that age 
were 
lost it much younger than seventeen 
you know 
ok 
eleven twelve it's like ew he we even look alike 
forget it 
but 
um 
yeah so i think i think birth control would be good 
and 

it's weird i i wish they would make it 
i don't wanna say  well i think they do make it free 
um and i hate to say it but a little bit easier access 
um 
because 
i don't think it will cause people to have more sex i think they're gonna have it anyhow 
so it would only be better 
and safer for them 
yeah 
uhhum 
uhhum 
the shot 
okay 
uhhum 
okay 
uhhum 
uhhum 
you know 
we  my husband and i were just talking about this 
i was saying i'm not in for the 
you know george orwell nineteen eighty four and big brother syndrome at all 
um 
my ideal situation would be 
that 
somebody decides who should have kids and who's not but i don't think god's gonna come down and do that 
we can't really decide that 
but 
to be honest 
i'm for it 
um 
it doesn't have to be well i'm not even sure tubes tied is 
is pretty 
permanent 
um 
but 
even if they could do something like on a yearly basis 
and give them two hundred dollars a year 
that's still not still much cheaper than them having kids 
um 
and then if they  
i'd give more money if they'd clean up their act 
just for them 
um 
as far as it being racist i don't think i think they're missing the  
the point 
because i'm sure there's some runaway white 
teenage girls out there too 
or mexican or what not 
um 
think the point is they're on drugs you know and i don't 
yeah 
i'm not 
i don't consider myself racist at all 
it is 
that that's what's happening but 
it's just one of those things that you hate to say yeah i'm for it because you sound like 
it's like 
everything is specific 
and 
permanent 
yeah i kind of have a problem with that 
um because they might change their mind 
but then again they can always adopt 
you know and 
i kind of look at it that way there's enough kids out there that 
need love and 
you don't 
yeah 
yeah 
uhhum 
yeah 
uhhum 
yeah 
yeah 
which cracks me up because if you've ever looked at the parents of models they're not necessarily all that 
yeah  
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
i know 
yeah 
i do too 
uhhum 
um 
not to sound like a broken record but i really think it's 
our uh 
backslide on 
on family units 
i think it's too easy to stay 
and i've been married and divorced so i've 
unfortunately had that experience to me 
um 
that 
it's too easy to get divorced 
um people don't really go into marriage with commitment 
and lifetime 
and have that 
i don't wanna say old fashioned values but just the value of this is very important 
um because lets face it 
to 
to me love is a choice 
because there's times when i don't love my husband i wanna smack him and he's being a little barney 
but i choose to be in love with him because i made that choice and then that passes 
and lo and behold an hour later week later what  
takes 
i'm in love with him again 
i mean really 
you know what i'm saying 
and um 
i think it's just too easy to get divorced 
i don't believe in staying in a marriage for the sake of a just children 
but i think if you really make that commitment and 
actually work on it 
you can have a great relationship you can  have kids 
and bring them up in 
a more stable environment 
um 
unfortunately i think that's 
the problem 
parents 
um are 
a either getting divorced 
and then they get caught up in their petty little things and start pitting the kids against each other 
you know using the kid as a medium 
um 
or 
they're too selfish and don't listen to their kids or they didn't 
i 
i don't wanna say selfish but lets face it like we said you know even having a dog takes some time out of your  
your  
your schedule 
and um 
not spend enough time with the kids 
you know they're working what not 
and it takes a lot of effort 
to raise kids these days and actually listen to them and get to know them 
and let them grow and things like that 
uh 
and i don't think 
enough 
families are doing that 
um 
i think  
uh some of it was that i think a lot of it is you do feel lonely 
um you do go through a period in your life 
where 
you don't feel like you have any friends or 
you feel totally different 
i mean i 
through that i think we all go through that at some point or other 
even yearly for some of us 
um 
so 
i'm just saying if he felt like he could go to somebody 
either in his family 
i say he  using those for example 
or 
the parents paid a little bit more attention and didn't have that blind eye 
i think that's part of your responsibility as a parent that 
if you see something potentially evil or wrongdoing in your 
child's eyes 
you need to really admit it 
um 
i mean you don't wanna do that 
but 
yeah 
yeah 
and his mom even signed for stuff i think 
yeah i mean you know 
signing 
oh here you go hun 
um 
the one 
i think is pretty obvious 
that 
the blind eye was something that shouldn't have happened 
the other one 
that yeah 
you just 
let's face it at that age and at every age we want a leader 
um 
and 
i guess it goes back if we choose 
to 
or we know how to make better decisions for ourselves we will make better decisions of who's gonna lead us 
so 
i don't know i  
the  i think a lot of it's the family unit breaking down 
in general 
you know 
and secondly i think to be honest i think the media's gotten a little carried away they sensationalize it 
um 
and i do think  
you know they know they're gonna get recognized they're gonna have their name go down in history 
unfortunately 
um 
i think that has something to do with it too 
um it's frustrating to turn on the news they don't really cover 
my husband comes from a journalistic background and he will be like 
that's not news 
you know what i mean it's just 
we get so ah 
let's sit here and watch a plane crash for twelve hours 
instead of watching 
i don't know what 
little house on the prairie 
oh yeah 
right 
right 
and just going over it and over it and over it 
then you get the shooting out in honolulu and the next day there's another one 
it's just kind of like 
that syndrome you know well at least i can be popular for fifteen minutes or whatever 
um 
i mean i'm not saying not to cover it 
but 
yeah 
and then course you have the whole gun control stuff that's just 
ridiculous 
um i think they might have tried any how but obviously they wouldn't have been as 
uh 
good at it 
or 
you know what i'm trying to say it wouldn't have  been as much distraction 
because obviously the bombs 
is something but 
to 
actually have that 
right there 
i mean have the access and what not i mean 
i guess the grandparents had the house 
locked 
and they broke in but just the fact that they were there and they knew  how to use them and 
that that scares me 
because 
the problem with guns in my opinion is you don't have to think to use it 
it takes you know you don't have to sit there and load it and 
in a split second 
i think we  
all are capable of shooting somebody 
for whatever reason 
you know just stupidity or whatnot 
i don't 
just in a split second 
you know 
we we might have that once in a life where we can kill somebody that quickly 
and you can't go 
oh 
you know 
i didn't mean to do that yeah 
well exactly 
i mean there are split seconds where you just wanna shoot somebody unfortunately 
anybody that says that 
i i mean i'm 
i don't even like stepping on ants 
but there's those moments where you're like 
yeah 
yeah 
and 
yeah so i 
no 
no 
yeah unfortunately 
well some people have to 
i mean you know the police  and what not they're required to carry a gun 
but 
um 
almost every kid i know that  
has had a  even if they keep a gun 
hidden here and the bullets hidden over here 
they find out a way to get to them 
and um 
i dated a guy where 
we came in on his little brother and he was loading the bullets in the gun 
and he had them  totally separate 
like that 
and 
kids know and they're curious 
um 
i don't know 
i i mean i'm not for guns because i've 
i 
they  
the guns don't scare me the people 
so 
no 
unless they have them in a safe or something 
and  
i just 
that protection like they said normally you use it against somebody you didn't mean to use it on 
and  somebody else comes into your house with a gun let's face it 
are you gonna have the peace of mind to go get it 
i'd rather just have a bat by my door or something 
um 
so 
uhhum 
uhhum 
no thank goodness or if i did i 
blanked it out 
uhhum 
yeah 
yeah 
right 
uhhum 
uhhum 
yeah 
uhhum 
uhhum 
well 
yeah 
but let's face it the people that have the real good guns are the 
meaning crime and whatnot 
um 
i 
don't have a problem with people having guns 
but 
we don't need 
sixty guns per person or whatever the ratio is it's something ungodly like that 
and they keep making them and 
mean yeah there was a time it was a part of our culture we did need to hunt to eat 
um 
i have friends that bow and arrow hunt 
i'm not real big into hunting but at least 
they're 
they have to do something besides sit there and 
um plus if they shoot somebody accidentally 
number one it's really hard to 
and secondly it probably won't kill them like a gun can 
um 
and you have to use your brain 
so 
i didn't come from a hunting 
background 
um 
but 
my husband does work for the state highway patrol so obviously we know a lot of people that have to carry guns 
but none of them 
hardly any of them 
hunt 
um 
and a lot of them 
they respect them 
if you know what i mean they realize they can kill people 
we do get some of the 
you know 
machismo people that just wanna go out and shoot 
things and 
yeah 
yeah 
i 
yeah i don't 
it's not the guns that's the problem it's the people 
that are teaching 
uhhum 
oh exactly i'm planning on just staying in the house if i can 
or whatnot  oh yeah 
yeah 
i know i mean we're gonna get some water and whatnot because you don't know people might turn things off like you said 
so 
yeah i think um 
as a whole we've all 
kind of gone our separate ways 
which is scary 
mean we don't have the same belief system in anything anymore so it's kind of like oh geez 
definitely 
definitely 
um 
i haven't personally researched it but i have seen 
um i would personally research it if i was president 
um documentaries and whatnot 
and things on twenty twenty 
which 
i don't 
whole heartedly believe just because it's on tv and they say it's so 
but if it is true and it probably is just because a lot of people will research it once it's on tv 
um 
that three strikes and you're out 
has really seemed to work in california 
because most of the people 
that are committing the violent crimes with guns or 
rapes or what not 
um 
are doing 
most of the crime 
so once they're locked up 
yeah it costs more money to house them for life 
but they're saving so much 
because crime has gone down because these people are in jail and not on the streets anymore 
so they don't have to catch them 
they don't have to process them etcetera 
um 
so i would really like to see that 
and plus i think once that really 
is 
in 
the works 
and really working and we're really do we're gonna say we're doing instead of like little parents no honey don't do that 
no honey don't do that 
you know what i mean because i think that's 
part of our problem too 
um 
yeah 
exactly 
um 
i think that would deter people 
um 
you get one strike and you're like uh 
oh 
um maybe i better clean up my act 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
sure 
no 
no 
but 
hopefully 
when they do get the one strike 
somebody 
i say somebody because 
i 
right now i don't really think we have that in place 
but we would need more of a um 
one strike 
stepping stone 
you know and  
let's face it counseling's probably not gonna work 
uh and somebody in that it would almost take um i 
do personally know people 
that 
go into that type of environment here in columbus and actually work 
with the families 
and 
work with the kids 
and actually are in there 
living there 
showing them 
you know  it's one thing to go help them 
and then leave that and go home to your nice house 
i don't 
i admit it i couldn't do it 
but 
um 
if people really 
did things like that i think there'd be help for them 
because they're actually 
friends 
or actually people that have 
been in that environment 
and come out 
those type of people i think might be able to reach them 
i won't be able to reach them 
probably 
just because 
what do i know about it 
um 
i'm 
yeah i agree 
i don't think it'd be a deterrent at all 
initially 
but 
if we had more things in place and somebody actually 
realized the background 
and tried to get them out of that 
hopefully even if you save half of them it's better than 
than anything 
uhhum 
uhhum 

yeah 
right 
right 
yeah i mean you don't want to see the chain gangs or the people whipping them 
i mean let's that's not right either 
um 
but 
yeah i'm not for the weight rooms because like they said they come out and then they're stronger 
they can do more damage 
yeah and you're like  and we paid for that okay 
so 
i think just to keep them busy you know even if they educate them i've heard of people you know the education 
um 
strong  i don't think it'd really hurt anybody 
um 
and  
i'd say incorporate that with some education 
um 
of some  you know 
mean i don't wanna go out in the sun and work 
or what not 
plus they're doing something 
in return for 
free housing 
do you know what i mean 
it's kind of a give and take there 
yeah 
yeah 
uhhum 
uhhum 
right 
right 
right 
yeah 
well unfortunately i don't think it's fair 
but 
i think in the long run 
it doesn't have to be a college education because 
most of those people probably wouldn't want 
a college education 
um but like a trade or a skill or something 
it will give them a little bit of hope 
if they do wanna choose to get a job instead of 
robbing a bank or selling drugs or whatever they did 
they have that choice 
it's it's 
it's up in their head okay i can either go 
become a welder 
or i can   have a gun 
um i mean if they want a college education 
um 
yeah it's 
it's not fair 
but 
for 
for you growing up and going into a lifestyle i would prefer 
having their colleges paid for and then being productive citizens 
than somebody robbing me someday because they didn't get an education 
i mean now that's a 
broad spectrum and i know it's not all that cut and  
um 
yeah it would upset me 
but hopefully i'd step back from it a little bit and go 
well 
maybe it is for the best 
yeah 
yeah i think it is 
course we were fiddling with that so much 

okay 
okay 
um i grew up in canton 
which is near cleveland 
um 
i moved here 
in ninety two to go to 
college 
um 
i spent my 
senior year abroad 
in england 
then i came back i have a double major 
and 
i had a quarter to finish off 
then i came back and did that and then 
went back to england to work 
then came back and back to england again and came back and i'm freelance right now 
freelance writer and editor 
um 
all types i 
i used to work in the music industry so i do a lot of 
music related writing 
in the position i'm in right now i do it 
just a variety of 
travel writing and that kind of thing  
concentrate 
primarily on editing 
uh 
actually when i was at ohio state i worked for the newspaper 
and 
i did a lot of music interviewing and 
writing there and then i moved up to editor 
and it was 
sort of through that job that i got my first job with 
sony 
while i was 
as a  
as a sort of ohio representative 
so i was concentrated in ohio state 
and then 
you know 
basically 
it's just something i'm not doing this 
as a career it's just sort of something i'm doing in the meantime till i 
decide whether i'm going back to school or 
what i'm doing 
um 
a lot of online 
magazines 
music magazines 
that kind of thing 
uh i would 
either go back in uh 
languages 
or 
actually i'm a psychology 
yeah 
i lived i studied in bristol and then when i went back and worked and then lived again i lived in london 
it was fantastic 
right 
absolutely 
i 
i can't imagine that it  i mean i'm sure brazil would've been  
more different experience but i think it was 
more just 
a resentment for 
sort of everything about america and what 
what they're fed it was a real love hate relationship 
you know it was 
while they totally embrace the culture and all the stores and everything like that 
and the food 
it you know the fast food or whatever 
they hate it at the same time because it's ruining 
you know  
i had a lot of friends from elsewhere in you know western europe 
and uh 
yeah they just were  
and  
i was quite surprised actually because when i first went there 
uh i'd worked on an  
previous 
i mean mackinaw island do you know it 
sort of just 
north of michigan but 
and i had met some english people there and it was 
you know there all the americans were like oh english people your accent is so neat and 
all that kind of thing and then when i went there 
you know i 
and this was actually one of my friends but i remember 
you know 
she was german and she was sort of asking me how you say different words and things and then 
she sort of looked at me and she said like 
oh 
actually i shouldn't be asking you i don't wanna learn the american way to say those like i wanna learn the british way to 
and people would say things all the time and it was 
you know they'd ask you what your background was 
and if you'd say well i'm american they said well you know like 
where 
your 
ancestors from or whatever 
and then you would tell them 
and then 
you know on the same turn they would just sort of like snicker and be like oh you're not 
whatever of this european thing you're 
you know sort of 
yeah yeah like 
definitely 
and 
and that what they say that we've done to the language and everything else and 
and 
you're not a typical american 
and then the next hour and a half they just say how 
bad americans are and you kind of think like 
well thanks for the exclusion but 
exactly 
right 
or american literature  you know  
you know if 
you know a historic building they're like 
oh 
there's no history in america 
uhhuh 
right 
right 
well it 
obviously i sort of surmounted that because i've been 
you know i spent a lot of time there since then i think had i 
only studied there for a semester  a quarter i would've come back with a completely different attitude but i was there for a whole year so the first few months were a little bit difficult but then 
you know after that you know you just sort of 
yeah get to the point where you're just kinda  
you know laugh it off and just think oh here we go again and then 
that's it 
you know 
uh 
no 
the lifestyle was 
you know very easy to fit into and i've always been 
you know 
interested it and 
you know 
sort of like to the whole like 
european culture 
um 
before i went there but 
i think 
the most difficult was 
actually because i was studying english when i went there 
and 
you know studying  here is 
a dime a dozen and 
studying english in  
or in 
england  
you know 
sort of 
i don't know uh more uh sort of elitist which i didn't realize before i got there 
so i was in all these courses i was the only american and the classes were really small 
and it was 
you know you 
i definitely got a feeling and a 
it 
there were a few classes that really stood out where  
you know there was sort of 
you know you'd 
i'd hafta say something or i'd hafta give a presentation or something and it was sort of like oh 
you know what what does this american know and 
you know it was that was the hardest thing is 
the way i was treated by some of my um peers in classes 
i mean not directly they'd never say anything 
terrible to you or anything but it was just sort of 
you know that feeling of 
uh 
and what they would say about americans and american culture like 
at 
that discussion group you know in front of you you know so 
i love columbus actually 
um 
when i left 
i was 
fed up with columbus 
and 
but 
like anything you know after being away for a while and 
not really 
you know being i mean i have 
friends there and everything but 
you know i missed my friends and i missed 
really sort of 
you know 
knowing everything in the city because london 
is never gonna be like that for me you know and it's just a totally different experience and 
you know i did miss columbus and i'm kinda glad to be back 
although now i miss london 
um 
well maybe not columbus in particular 
but 
i don't know i was 
i think i was just a little burnt out because i was doing the two majors and i was 
i had a heavy course load 
every quarter and i had gone to summer school here as well just to get more done and so i'd 
you know done seven straight quarters and 
i'm sure that added to it i had a lot of hard classes and 
you know 
i was just tired of 
red tape and 
that whole thing 
in english 
uhhum 
uh 
well i think  because i went abroad i had 
basically one extra quarter beyond four years 
but  i said i went to summer school too and 
i was taking like 
you know 
twenty one 
a quarter so 
yes 
uhhum 
yeah i do miss that 
but at the same time i've 
you know i had a lot of opportunity 
to be there and to do those things so 
and i mean there 
there are 
you know 
it's obviously you can't compare it but 
you know there are cultural things to do in columbus and it does sort of make me mad when 
you know people are kinda like oh columbus you know there's nothing to do there i find myself defending columbus a lot more now than 
i ever 
would've before 
uhhuh 

yes 
right 
right 
absolutely 
oh yes 
i'd come back and it's 
the simplest things 
uhhum 
uhhum 
um 
actually 
i was over there when all of that happened but of course it was 
all over the papers and 
you know 
i think 
i mean i  i don't know what it was like really here i can imagine but 
i mean there especially they really focused on 
um 
not columbine but 
the one with the 
the younger kids in arkansas 
was it 
the year before i was there for 
both of those but 
you know 
in the first one you know they they put the picture of the little kid in combat gear  holding the gun 
everywhere and 
columbine 
you know 
every paper had a slightly different slant on the story and 
you know their facts were all over the place but that's another 
kind of issue but 
um 
what i think caused it i mean 
i don't know i think that 
like 
more should've been made of the fact of 
you know this 
like 
terrible 
sort of 
resentment for the other students and 
and 
you know i'm not in any way defending 
the guys who did it but 
um 
you know 
something 
is wrong 
not only with them but in the fact that they were like driven to that point where they felt so hated and so maligned or whatever 
that 
you know that you would even 
think of doing something like that 
um 
i don't know especially with 
you know everything that was said about the families and 
you know they didn't seem to 
of course you never really know but they didn't seem to have grown up in this you know terrible environment and 
you know have that sort of 
you know 
preconditioned or anything like that 
um 
yeah i think  
a lot more effort 
needs to be made 
you know to sort of 
you know placate those sort of situations and 
i mean 
who does it is sort of another question because 
you know the teachers already 
are over worked and underpaid and 
you know 
all those kind of things but 
i don't know 
right 
right 
right 
well i do think access is too easy but it's sort of 
like anything else i think if laws were passed 
the people who were 
against it would be so 
you know 
just beside themselves that it would 
i don't know for how long but i think it would make 
the situation 
not with  
the shootings and things like that but i think it would make 
the 
just the gun situation probably  
much worse for a while because people would be 
you know 
doing 
illegal things to get guns and that sort of thing 
but 
i mean too many people have guns here 
there's too much of a 
in my opinion you know there's too much of a gun culture 
i mean over there 
they've 
pretty much 
outlawed guns except for hunting and things and the fact that  
you know of course there are some floating around but the fact that you can pretty much successfully do that 
obviously england's such a small country in comparison but 
i mean that's just amazing to me 
and 
but it's true i mean the fact that 
you know the access is just 
there's 
almost nothing barred and i mean 
just the amount of people that i just hear sort of 
you know in conversation talking about oh yeah i 
you know 
getting a gun for security and all this stuff it's like 
you know 
your chances of 
number one needing it 
and 
number two 
if you were in that just minute 
percentage of 
you know 
happen chance that you would need it the fact that 
if you used it to shoot someone who wasn't you know i  
everything is against you 
you know 
yeah exactly and it's just 
it's just ridiculous but so many people don't seem to think that way and 
i do think 
yeah access 
it would help if access 
were restricted 
or 
at least if they were more 
careful about it i mean it seems like even 
the laws that there are in place now aren't necessarily followed and 
you know that kind of thing 
but the whole 
it 
especially with the first 
few shootings you know with the children's 
i mean 
you know they shouldn't know where the keys are if there were keys to the gun cabinet or whatever i mean the fact that 
a you know how do you explain your way out of 
your kids taking guns to school 
right 
oh were they were already in the garage did they not buy them themselves 
oh right 
oh right 
right 
right 
right 
well it's sort of a problem as well the 
you know 
does 
i mean uh it's seems 
you know from what i've read it 
if you wanted to make a bomb it's fairly  
uncomplicated 
you know so 
that's 
right 
um 
at the age that they were 
i don't know 
i 
i wouldn't 
personally like think that the parents should be held responsible 
i mean they do have 
you know a certain amount of responsibility for the fact that they should've been more aware and 
and especially because 
i mean i believe that those 
or at least one of the two had been in 
counseling and 
had to 
you know was doing it 
aggression management or something like that 
um 
you know you would think 
that 
if they were going through something like that 
you would just sort of 
you know maybe keep a closer eye on 
what they were doing so i think 
you know 
to that degree 
you know the parents should've 
um 
you know 
um 
worse 
sort of responsible 
and also 
with like their kids disposition i mean 
you know 
would you not notice some difference if something like that was going to happen i mean depending on 
a 
you know how well they hid it or whatever but 
um 
i think at that point though you're 
you're so influenced by your peers 
that like  
the parental influence isn't as much as 
you know before then i think by the time that you are past adolescence 
uhhum 
right 
i know 
um 
well like i said before i think 
i don't know i think screening would be very difficult 
i mean 
especially 
because at that age you're gonna have a lot of people who are 
you know people say things to say things and to get a reaction and 
to tell their friends that 
they said i mean 
you know 
they can play off 
whatever and unless they were 
you know 

highly 
skilled or trained in that area i mean 
you can't really do a simple sort of screening and 
these are good and these are bad uh and 
again as i mentioned previously 
i think it's more to do with 
maybe being aware of the interaction 
of 
you know the different students with each other and 
i mean if it was as bad as 
they claimed it to be or as it appeared to be and 
i mean you're you're never going to get rid of all of that because there are always different groups and different cliques but 
i can't help but thinking that if it was bad enough that you would 
do something like that 
that 
you know 
had to have been more than just 
you know sort of 
normal 
jocks versus 
whatever 
so i think it should be more 
i don't know 
i mean even 
you know i went to a 
private 
catholic highschools 
but 
even there you know there was 
you know uh 
a sense of that and i mean some of the things that went on 
should definitely not have been going on and that was 
only on a very small level there were eighty six people in my graduating class you know and i mean 
this is a highschool with like several hundred students that this happened at so 
uhhum 
uhhum 
i think in fifth grade 
was the first 
um 
i mean at that point 
i uh 
i certainly didn't have 
any uh 
real 
knowledge 
of that sort of thing 
um 
you know they covered 
the basics 
they did talk about condoms and 
um contraception 
i remember we 
watched a film 
which everyone was very embarrassed by 
um 
i mean i don't really 
uh they uh they did send home a packet to the parents 
because i remember being really upset and not wanting my mom 
um 
but 
you know i think what they did was 
fairly good they didn't really 
as far as i remember at that point at least they didn't 
well they must have done gone into the sort of moral issue 
um 
but it i 
what i remember was more of a scientific approach 
uhhum 
right 
all i remember is 
them talking about condoms i don't think they talked about 
anything besides that 
but 
um 
then again 
i could 
um but yes that  mean 
it is the stance but i think 
in the schools 
i mean that's sort of like the the hard line of the catholic church but in the more progressive schools they're a little bit more realistic 
i mean this wasn't 
i mean it was a catholic school but we didn't have nuns or anything there i mean 
um 
you know i think 
they were sort of 
more concerned with 
you know 
it it actually it might have been later than the first 
um 
sex education we had that young i mean it might have been more like a  
like eight grade that they talked about condoms 
i doubt that they would've done that that early now that i think about it 
but i know that there was at one point 
you know 
some sort of 
uhhum 
um 
not really 
because i think 
you know 
if they're going to 
they're going to and 
i don't think 
a lot of them at 
that stage are gonna go out of their way to go 
and buy them so i don't think it's like 
oh i have a condom i'm going to have sex 
i mean actually it's 
this 
is is very hot topic in england right now because they they've got 
the highest rate 
of teenage pregnancy in the world 
and i mean there are stories everywhere about 
you know twelve year olds having babies and 
i mean there they've gone to distributing 
condoms on playgrounds which i do think is 
a little bit 
too much i think maybe having them available in the nurses office is one thing 
they're there 
you know 
they can go and 
and 
get some or something but i think actually like physically 
you know passing them out is a bad idea 
but demonstrating and that kind of thing i think is pretty important just 
you know uh 
because of the simple fact of the statistics that they're they are doing it so 
at least 
at the very least they might as well be 
you know safe about it 
um 
well actually 
it's 
sort of all happening in a certain area 
you know with 
you know very high unemployment like council 
council states 
um 
you know 
the sort of stereotype you know kind of bad family environment 
you know 
parents have lots of 
boyfriends and girlfriends drugs everything else and 
you know a lot of these 
girls that have been interviewed 
you know say oh you know i wanted something to love or 
you know 
we were bored so we decided to have sex and i mean i find it just totally appalling 
and 
you know a thirteen year old boy who was interviewed was saying 
oh you know he had 
you know 
slept with like 
ten girls or something and 
i'm thinking 
oh my gosh you know and he's thirteen and 
you know had a few kids and 
that was it but 
in my opinion the main problem there is 
they get more support 
even at that age 
when they have 
they 
you know they get unemployment because once they've had a kid even if they're not 
of working age they get like a 
an a certain amount of money and then once they reach i think  
um fifteen or sixteen 
if they have a baby they're provided they're  
the top of the list for a council house 
so they get their own there was actually a 
long documentary on before i left 
um 
you know of this girl who was constantly fighting with her parents 
and 
you know her parents were at the end of their rope 
she got pregnant and she was like well 
you know hey 
this is my ticket to move out because she gets her own place she gets 
money for herself money for the baby she doesn't have to pay any utilities or anything 
and 
you know 
what more 
could she want 
you know was basically what she was saying 
i've got my own place i can do whatever i want i'm getting money and i don't have to work 
and 
and so 
that i think is a very bad situation because they're almost rewarded for 
you know 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
um 
you will 
i i just got back from 
a year in england so  i'm not sure about the new 
right 
stay on it 
right 
uhhum 
uhhum 

uhhum 
well is there any kind of 
you know training i mean do you 
are they doing like the whole 
job training after the two years or during the two years 
right 
right 
right 
i think that's great 
you know i think 
obviously 
there's always 
a down side and 
but 
i think that 
too many people abuse the system 
and 
you know 
unfortunately 
it's 
very hard when 
you know 
then it ruins it for the people who really do need it 
and but 
you know as long as they have 
you know created 
a system 
whereby 
you know it won't be 
obviously as good for those people 
as it has been the ones who are genuinely unemployable but 
you know 
i think 
depending on how 
um 
sort of focused they are on 
the individuals in their area or whatever however it's divided up 
i don't know hopefully 
not special treatment but obviously you would try to steer them more in 
whichever direction they're most suited for 
you know as  
far as maybe like the volunteer work because i mean 
you know there is so much volunteering to be done 
everywhere and even if you don't have 
you know 
if you're lacking in 
whatever way 
think that you can 
you know there is something 
you know hopefully that 
i don't know 
uhhum 
uhhum 
actually they're they are working on it i'm sorry i didn't mean to interrupt you uh 
um 
they've 
they've um just instated some bonus schemes where 
as 
the poverty  
level i think is considered um 
thirteen 
thousand pounds a year 
um 
and if 
if you're below the poverty level and you do go back to work you get a certain like 
extra 
bonus 
beyond 
yeah so there's a bonus for back to work 
you mentioned earlier about like how this would effect the children with this two year welfare thing 
i mean at least 
i know a lot more about 
the system there for 
reason than i do about the system here which is kind of unfortunate but 
um 
there i mean 
i don't really think 
and a lot of situations 
of course 
i i'm sure there are people who follow it 
as it should be and who 
who really need it and who really 
you know taking care of their children but unfortunately you don't really see that side very much you see the people who like 
their kids see none of that money 
you know they're left at home by themselves 
if 
if they can even 
you know get them to school if they even go to school if they're even bothered you know 
and 
you know those 
you know a lot of there's there  documentaries on all the time there so you really 
it's sort of  
it's more in your face than it is here at 
that i ever noticed um 
but i do think 
and and 
with that they have specific programs for the children and 
um 
i think one of the problems too with the schools is the fact that you know 
if a 
if a kid has bad behavior or 
you know bad attendance that you send them home i mean i think that's the most ridiculous thing like surely that's 
not a punishment for a lot of these kids 
and 
you know 
at least in england 
on these things i've seen you know they send them home and these kids are just 
doing whatever 
going around the neighborhood shoplifting bullying 
you know hotwiring cars at the age of you know ten or something and 
i don't know i think 
i do have 
about 
people 
yeah who 
are having all these kids and don't take care of them 
at all 
um 
yes i 
haven't they talked about that here actually 
have they talked about 
right 
right with the human rights 
right 
um 
personally i think it's a good idea i mean uh 
i 
i mean 
to me 
you know 
it seems only logical that you would only have the amount of children that you can support 
you know and that 
but 
i come from a completely different you know background and everything else and 
the education and a lot  you know 
then most of 
probably the people that this would 
um concern 
but i do think 
i 
i don't know 
i mean 
with uh the  
birth control that is available 
and 
you know 
all the options that there are 
sometimes 
i find it 
hard to be sympathetic for 
you know these people who just have so many children that they can't feed they  can't take care of 
i mean 
it's not like 
it was 
way back when when there was nothing and  
you were just stuck this way i mean a 
can 
you know 
protect herself 
if 
you know the  
the man isn't willing to do it or whatever 
so and and 
and 
adoption and all the other things 
um 
i mean i feel 
i lean toward no 
i don't have a problem actually i saw something on the news the other night about they were offering 
um 
crack mothers 
like 
money for sterilization and there was a big debate about that 
um 
but again like the argument 
there on the human rights side was that if they're 
you know 
on cocaine or whatever they can't 
make 
the sound decision to be sterilized but at the same time like 
can they make the sound decision to have children 
right 
right 
right 
uhhum 
right 
um well 
as far as the racism issue first 
uh they showed some figures on the news and actually 
it was 
like 
more 
white women 
who had actually 
had it 
done 
than 
uh 
than 
um hispanic or african american 
but 
i don't know 
at least 
in that case 
i mean before we were talking about the government 
i mean at least in that case there still is a choice 
i mean 
there's money involved but it's 
it's not 
so much money that 
it would 
radically change your life 
in a sort of 
you know it's not thousands of dollars if it was two hundred i believe 
and 
and 
that's 
you know i mean if 
if that 
amount of 
money 
is 
going to sway you 
in that direction 
i don't know 
i think 
you know there is the debate about ten years down the line 
but  
you know is there going to be something that's going to make them change 
you know what is it you know 
what is it going to be and like how 
how realistic 
is it for you know what percentage i mean i don't know anything about the sort of statistics of 
people who do clean up their act or anything like that but 
i mean i do think if there is that element of choice 
it's a lot different than 
you know the government 
saying okay this is your cut off limit but i mean the statistics they were  giving on 
um the average number of children that these women were having and 
you know 
you know the 
average 
number of children that were just 
taken to the hospital and left there or 
you know just dropped off wherever and and the state these children were in and 
their lifespan and everything else i mean 
you know there's the human rights for the mother but what about the human rights for the 
the child's life you know i mean i think 
all that is forgotten about in so many of these cases and 
you know the same 
is in england yeah everyone saying 
oh because they were talking about 
you know 
i mean again was just an idea they were kicking around but sort of 
you know 
somehow 
sort of 
forcing these young girls to at least be on birth control 
you know 
in whatever way and 
and 
again that 
everyone was up in arms but it's 
sort of like 
you know 
what is that child's quality of life gonna be when their mothers 
just 
you know 
right 
right 
uhhum 
oh yes definitely in england too 
uhhum 
hm 
uhhum 
right 
um i don't 
i mean there definitely is that image of 
you know dallas and dynasty i think it's 
it's worse 
i think 
for 
the 
the 
image of the tourist like basically they think 
anyone who can 
afford to be over there 
must be absolutely loaded 
you know and that was sort of another thing 
when 
you know i went to 
school there 
is 
you know 
i had a scholarship 
that's how i went there 
you know and 
i worked the whole time i was in highschool in college and all this kind of thing but it was just like 
yeah people just thought oh you are american you are here therefore 
you must have lots of extra money to throw around 
and 
you know they just  sort of don't grasp the fact that 
you know 
you can have made sacrifices to be there 
but 
i do think 
also in films you know i remember actually being in bristol and that film california 
with brad pitt and juliette lewis and you know they're in 
the trailer and everything else and 
you know 
their accent and 
and 
i remember 
a bunch of people were sitting in this sort of lounge room watching this and they said like 
oh 
you know something like is that what they talk like or is that what it's like in the south and i thought 
you know 
what an image to have of like 
the south and 
you know i was just kind of shocked 
at this 
but 
i think that there 
you know 
with 
you know people who are going to university there and things like that 
there isn't necessarily that opinion maybe 
you know 
in a certain sector like when all you've heard is 
the consumption and everything else there might be more of that idea but i think 
you know 
most people 
like me or whatever 
they 
well 
i shouldn't say like 
but 
you know people who have more education sort of 
not even without having to really think about it but 
you know there isn't just that 
blatant view i mean i think that it is 
um 
the consumption thing 
like 
i think a lot 
more realize now 
that 
you know 
i think americans have this 
just 
reputation which is totally true for like spending spending spending 
and 
like 
obviously when you give that a closer look 
so many people are in debt i mean i think i just saw something else on the news that said 
you know 
across the board 
we don't even break even we're like 
negative one or something 
right right 
right 
credit cards 
right 
exactly exactly 
absolutely 
oh yeah 
i know 
and that's actually a really interesting thing too because 
especially coming back 
you know and 
moving all my stuff out of storage 
i've just been on this you know i'm getting rid of half of everything i own because over there it's 
you know 
it just feels so weird to come back and i feel so 
loaded down especially when i've spent so much time just living out of a suitcase you know i just really realize 
i have so much stuff that i don't need because there you know everyone has just sort of like 
a little closet with clothes you know there isn't stuff all around everything is more expensive so everyone has a lot less and here it's like 
everything is so 
relatively inexpensive that it's like 
you know picture frames or something there might be you know twenty five dollars for one so you buy one here 
oh 
you know they're five dollars a piece lets buy five you know 
yeah 
exactly 
um 
well i think 
the price has a lot to do with it 
because 
i mean that's what i see 
see over there that prevents it 
you know 
there a sort of middle of the line 
dress that would be like at the limited here or something is 
you know 
seventy five pounds 
you know at 
like a dollar sixty five or whatever conversion i mean that's a lot 
you know you see them in the limited and you think whatever the price is expensive but 
you know 
really if you buy that 
you're not really gonna be 
buying 
you know more than one or like anything else for awhile and 
i think 
i mean here there is that sort of like you know 
he who has the most wins or whatever that 
you know phrase is and 
you know there is that with 
c d's and 
whatever 
but 
i don't know 
i mean 
even with the food and everything else 
i mean 
it's cheap people buy so much of it like portions 
are so big because the restaurants can get it more cheaply i mean there 
you know the portions are a lot smaller it's more expensive you just eat less and i mean 
you just see it contributing to everything i mean 
it the obesity problem here and everything else i mean 
it's getting worse there than it was but i mean it's 
nowhere is it any where near and that is 
a large part of the like 
problem with 
that 
people were constantly on me about oh why are americans so fat and like 
all these things on the television about the americans and i mean that was never ending 

right 
right 
that is surprising 
oh yeah 
oh yeah 
yeah i mean it's just sort of like the whole reputation of 
yeah  
america just being like the country of excess like excess possessions excess food excess weight excess money 
you know 
everything 
you know and it's 
you know i sort of have mixed feelings about it the first time when i was gone for 
about a year and a half 
and i 
back 
and 
you know this i had done like a lot of traveling over there and everything and really loved the whole atmosphere especially of mainland europe and everything and i come back and 
you know where my parents live there were all these you know new strip malls built and stuff 
and i just felt like i was in 
you know 
this like giant 
it just was so overwhelming 
even though obviously i'd grown up 
with 
in america my whole life and 
you know not that i sort of 
completely but you do when you've been away from it and to come back and you know to go into these like 
places and like just the other day my friend took me to 
easton and i mean 
you walk in there and i don't feel like i'm in columbus you know i feel like 
it's got to be california or something just because it's just 
definitely 
wow 
right 
was she where's she from latin america 
oh okay 
uhhum 
uhhum 
right 
oh right 
uhhum 
oh i bet 
right 
and just totally bombarded and i mean here it's so force fed as well i mean i 
i  
home just before halloween 
and 
you know i  
i walked into the grocery store and i mean just like 
right there were just like 
cookies like 
everything just right in front of you 
with like all this halloween stuff on and i mean 
all the holidays in here are  pushed at you and 
such a money making 
you know and it's so over the top where there it's sort of like 
there's a little bit of that and there are decorations and stuff at christmas but it isn't so much 
you know and 
and just like all the little trinkets and everything that everybody has here to put around i mean there 
there isn't that 
at all 
i mean at least  
you know 
my 
there and i mean i can't imagine 
because you know western europe i think  
sort of as much like 
america as you can get 
probably 
you know 
most 
places elsewhere in 
in the world 
and i mean 
that would have been a fantastic experience 
right 
right right 
wow 
uhhum 
absolutely 
uhhum 
uhhum 
well 
there's the whole theory that 
you know 
it has to drop back at some point 
but 
i don't see it happening 
any 
time in the near future 
and 
uh 
as with a lot of the resentment that's felt 
that i experienced toward americans 
rather saddeningly i think 
our culture is starting 
to really 
infuse itself into 
europe at least 
i mean i see instead of 
us becoming more like them you know 
becoming more like us walmart has bought you know 
a  
uh retailer there so 
yeah 
and and it's just it's moving there the whole 
you know strip malls and i was in 
i spent my first 
there in belgium with a friend and i mean 
we would drive by and she'd be like oh 
this is because of you know your country these people are moving in and buying 
and 
so 
i see it moving in the other direction unfortunately rather than 
really 
wow 
yeah 
is there  
the resentment to things like mcdonalds there   is it 
right 
oh right 
right 
right 
right 
right 
because that is sort of what i found interesting there too i mean there were a lot of jibes 
about that i remember 
um 
driving 
to germany 
with a couple a english friends and 
to visit some german friends of theirs and 
we got there and it 
we  got lost and all these things that took us way longer than it should've and 
a friend of the person we were visiting said like 
oh what did you have to stop at every mcdonalds along the way and i was like 
i 
i'm a 
i don't even eat at mcdonalds you know and 
i was  
you know and it was really mean it's like 
isn't really a very good joke 
and that kind of thing came up 
quite frequently but 
you know i always said 
mcdonalds wouldn't survive here if no one ate there and you can't tell me that everyone in there 
is american 
and they never were i mean the same with 
like in france especially oh mcdonalds 
well mcdonalds was full of all the french people you know i mean 
right 

test one two three four five five four three two one 
okay 
uhhum 
okay 
okay uh i've been in columbus since nineteen seventy seven 
and uh i'm an air traffic controller 
and i have three more days to work before i retire 
i'm  
i i  i'm retiring sunday 
so and tomorrow's my 
dinner 
so uh 
a little nervous about what i have to do there you know 
they've told me nothing except show up 
uh i have a daughter at 
o u i know that's 
a bad word for you guys 
and i have one at northland highschool she's a 
sophomore there and the one at o u's a freshman 
and uh i'm married 
and uh what else i live in uh northeast columbus 
by seventy one and one sixty one 
and 
that's about it 
uh i'm originally from 
indiana 
but i lived up in uh amherst ohio i lived there for about four years and then i because i worked at a place called cleveland center 
which is an air route traffic control center and i moved from there to 
ohio state 
airport 
and i worked there for nineteen years 
and uh then i transferred to 
port columbus 
about two  
two and a half years ago 
right uhhum  uhhum 
oh okay 
oh yeah 
yeah 
oh wow 
oh 
so you have it on the speed dial 
yeah 
uhhum 
yeah 
right 
yeah 
uhhum 
oh 
i don't know what kind that is because i know they  they 
traded airplanes since i've been gone 
yeah 
oh because uh  some of the newer  jets there's like some that sound like a vacuum cleaner i mean it's 
there are 
prop planes that are like five times as noisy 
so 
oh 
um 
oh they do now 
because they wouldn't let them when  i was there 
oh okay 
oh 
yeah 
uh they uh 
stopped 
federally funding uh o s u that was a federal control tower 
and they contracted it out so you either 
lost your job and stayed there and worked for the contractor or you picked up and moved on and you know some people moved like to arizona and california and 
and i thought well since i only have like two and a half years 
til i retire 
and i really like columbus 
and i thought i don't want to  
uproot my daughters out of school and  
and leave and start over so i thought well i will just go to port columbus and 
suffer it out until i can 
retire yeah 
well i don't really like the uh i don't    i really don't like that job 
but uh 
you know i like the people there but it's like uh way too busy i think 
oh it can be yeah 
yeah there are there are times when it all just 
there's a uh group over there called star check 
and they fly checks 
like 
if you write a check today and you deposit at the bank 
well that check has to go from your bank 
to clearinghouse 
and that's all they do all night long 
right tuesday wednesday and thursday 
every night 
so like thirty of them will 
go out at one time and thirty will come back well that isn't too bad 
but they're mixed in with 
everybody else that's normally flying like all the airliners and stuff so and they want to get there a s a p so 
you know 
i 
i just don't 
feel comfortable doing 
that much at one time i mean not that 
o s u is not a was not a a dead place you know it was very busy it's like the third busiest in ohio 
but uh yeah it's amazing and they're only open sixteen hours a day 
so you know 
um 
it it's pretty 
pretty busy there but 
it 
it's  spread out over the sixteen hours is where as port columbus sometimes you have like maybe seventy five eighty airplanes 
in an hours time 
so 
uh well we have an 
upstairs and downstairs upstairs is the tower and there's like a uh ground control 
a clearance  which reads all the clearances all the airplanes and the ground control taxis them to and from the runway and the tower works 
everybody 
landing and departing 
or any airplane within five mile radius 
then once they get out of that 
radius downstairs which is called the approach control they work 
everything from there 
to ten thousand feet 
and out to about sixty miles 
and when they get to that point then they go to the en route centers 
so 
you know 
downstairs there's five different sectors so they split the uh 
area up into five different areas 
and uh you know there are some 
sectors down there that get 
extremely busy and then sometimes it's just like you know you're just twiddling your thumbs it's 
uh it's like feast or famine 
you know it's not like steady like if you're 
working at meijer running the cash register it's just kind of like steady it's like you look at 
you know you  
you'd be like sitting at meijer and there's 
no one in your line 
and then you turn your back and turn back around and there's like seventy five 
waiting 
and they all want to go right now 
you know and that's how most airplanes are you know they all they don't think about anybody else they think 
i'm here why um 
why aren't i first 
you know so 
right 
uh well the problem is is um 
like say 
every airline wants to go to new york city and they want all their business men there at eight a m 
well 
an airport has 
so many runways 
and so many taxi ways 
and you know like say 
ten airplanes 
every ten minutes can come in and out 
of those airports 
well 
they 
end up shooting like thirty there 
so 
instead of letting them all get in the air 
and staying up there and hold while they're  uh you know shooting them in what they do is they uh 
like uh say going to o'hare they will 
you hafta call for release times at these different airports 
and they will say well uh 
he can't go right now but he can go like at 
twenty seven past the hour 
so he they know by looking at the entire picture and how many airplanes are coming to that airport 
when he will fit in 
so it's not so much 
air traffic delays it's 
airlines that cause it themself it's like uh you know like 
you and i and five hundred people want to get to this room 
at ten o'clock today 
well rather than say 
why don't some of you come at ten 
and another group come at ten fifteen another group 
and we're 
all trying to do the same thing at once and it doesn't work you know you 
you can't get 
you can only get so many people through that door 
and if you say well i'm gonna take five at a time 
well they can get in but if you say i'm taking five hundred at time 
it doesn't work and 
so the  
airlines always go well it's the government 
and regulations and blah blah blah that's 
why we're delayed and it's really them themselves 
because they're 
right 
you know because every businessman goes i want to be there at you know 
and it doesn't work that way you know you can't 
you just can't physically do it 
i 
that i don't know 
but uh you know it's like if 
if you and i are running an airline 
and everybody wants to get new york at eight a m and you go at eight 
and i go at eight thirty 
who are they gonna fly 
so that i think that's a problem too you know everybody says well i don't want to get there at eight thirty 
you know so 
yeah 
the one thing they've done is they've 
put on bigger airplanes 
because it used to be you know you 
like a uh 
say uh 
seven thirty seven would go from here to new york city and now it's a seven fifty seven so that adds more seats 
so instead of 
because i  when i first got there i couldn't understand 
at o s u 
when it was like 
christmas time or something it was just 
you'd drive up and the parking lot was just full of cars and you're like oh boy 
gonna be a really busy day 
and i would 
the same thing at port columbus you know i 
i'd see 
all these cars but it would be just about the same traffic and i'm like 
and i mentioned somebody i go 
where are the extra airplanes and they go they can't add extra airplanes 
it's 
they have certain routes they can do they just hafta  
put 
bigger airplanes on 
so he said 
you know you will see larger airplanes when it's 
holiday time so they can 
put more people on 
so 
oh yeah 
yeah 

i know i don't 
i 
i guess it's just 
over the course of the year everything balances out 
so 
uhhum 
uh 
until they start 
getting 
a little bit better equipment because the equipment is really ancient i mean there's stuff there that's older than i am 
so but they like uh port columbus is getting a new tower 
and they're it's supposed be done in about three and a half years 
and the equipment they're getting is 
all brand new stuff it's not like they're taking all the old junk we've got 
and moving it over there so 
you know that will help and 
and 
nationwide they're also putting new stuff in but the bad part is is 
um 
picture your father 
is your father computer literate 
okay 
he's 
he's at his job and tomorrow morning they come in and they go 
everybody's gonna put 
all their work 
on computer 
well 
his speed was like say 
seventy mile an hour before and now it's gonna be 
twenty 
because he doesn't know how to do it and that's the problem they're running into they have all these qualified people who know how to separate airplanes and how to get them in 
trail and 
you know everything 
but now they've gotta do this 
extra part 
which is going to make their job easier 
down the road 
but everybody hates change 
so what they're doing now is 
it 
they're having problems because 
people can't take the volume of airplanes because they're trying to keep up with the computer so it's making it even slower yet but once they get in 
you know in the swing of things it will be okay but 
you know you're 
you're talking a while you know because it's not something that you can do overnight but it'd be like your dad learning the computer he's not going to do it overnight 
and 
right and if he 
if he's open minded enough to do it 
eventually he will see the light and say 
boy this would make it a lot easier but 
there are people who are like 
i will not 
do this 
you know 
so 
those the ones that 
hafta be drug screaming and kicking 
right 
uhhum 
right 
uhhum 
there's a lot of uh 
money 
money in town here and there's sometimes like you will see 
a uh 
one 
entire 
airplane that goes to cancun 
and it's like people are going on vacation or people who are gonna go gambling in jamaica 
that's all it is 
so then when that comes in we have these really weird painted airplanes and we're like 
who 
is that 
and they will go that's transmeridian and we go 
write that down because i don't know that name you know so 
uhhum 
uhhum 
right 
i 
the 
accents sometimes but uh 
they they uh they're okay i mean no  
no big problem but uh the the accent sometime it's like 
um 
there's sort of a uh 
running 
joke i don't know if i should say this but it's like 
if i can talk like  
and uh talk 
all the time like this 
why is it that they can't talk like 
we do 
you know it's like you know if i could if i could talk that way 
we  do have pilots that do talk like 
and 
sometimes 
it's even easier to understand them because their they enunciate so well 
but uh you know 
it that's something we've never understood you know if we can 
fake that accent 
why can't they fake ours to make it easier for 
us to understand but 
you know 
but no usually there's no problem 
the only problem you usually have is like somebody like yourself 
who has never flown 
and is taking lessons 
and you 
you have about ten or fifteen hours 
and we tell you to do something and you like 
um 
well 
i think i know what they mean so i will just keep flying and it that's the worst thing you can do the best thing to do is say 
okay 
i heard what you said 
but i'm brand new at this and i've got no idea what you mean can you try it again and they will go okay now we know where you're coming from 
and they will make it really easy for you because if they just you know 
you know zoom out some phraseology and you go 
nine eight juliet which is 
the 
how you respond with a call signing the airplane 
they go she's got it and they go on to the next guy and then all a sudden you're going off this way and they go uh six nine juliet uh  
where are you going and you're like uh 
i uh told me to and then they go oh brother you know so now 
you know 
the attention is diverted to you so 
that's usually what the problem is because 
most pilots are there are really professional 
yeah 
uhhum 
oh understanding 
yeah 
uhhum 
we don't really have that much you know the foreign ones 
um 
it 
it'd probably be like maybe 
two or three percent of our total 
pilot 
yeah 
uhhum right 
no 
um i used to be a charter pilot and a flight instructor 
and i used to go to work at like eight o'clock in the morning and get home for my first meal with johnny carson 
and i did this six days a week 
and to get my 
my one day off i would get up at like at seven o'clock get in my car and drive to the mall and park and sleep in my car 
because i i didn't own a telephone 
because i couldn't afford one and 
and also i thought if i had one they will call me 
well they would come you know if i didn't get up that time on my day off they'd come knocking at the door and say we need you to come for a trip 
so you know one day um 
it was a really bad day i'd gone 
to like tulsa oklahoma with somebody and came back and you know i 
like i said i hadn't had 
anything to eat the entire day 
and uh it was like 
it was like midnight and i got home and i thought oh i'm too hungry 
you know to 
i'm too tired and hungry and i just thought uh i'm not making anything so i just went to bed 
and uh 
a guy knocked on my door 
which he lived upstairs in the apartment above me and he tell me  are you in there 
and i wouldn't answer 
well it was a real cheap apartment he took a credit card and punched the uh 
the 
door knob and 
opened it up and it 
grabbed on the chain and he reached in and flipped the lights on 
and he goes  do you hear me 
and i go yeah and he goes you got a trip be out the airport at four thirty 
and i go 
he says you hear me and i go 
yeah uh yeah 
he goes 
well get some sleep and he turns the lights off pulls the door shut 
and uh 
i'm laying there and i'm like 
i've been home like three hours and now i'm just fuming 
and i thought 
i know 
a college education doesn't guarantee you 
financial security 
but i thought 
what am i doing 
working 
you know from dust 
i mean dawn to 
way past dusk six days a week and making nothing and having people like this come tell me 
you gotta go to work tomorrow 
so i 
went upstairs and knocked on his door and 
told him i quit 
and uh he wasn't very thrilled about that but one of my students was a uh 
controller 
and uh 
he came and talked to me and he says uh 
he says i know 
i heard you quit he says i want to 
tell you about 
my job and he was a controller at 
owensboro kentucky 
and uh he said he worked forty hours a week and i go 
well 
i usually do that by wednesday 
and he said that he had uh 
annual leave 
and sick leave and i 
said what are 
and he said that he had a health plan and i said what is that 
and i 
he said he had insurance 
life insurance and i go 
what is that 
so he goes 
you know we really need to get you over here so that's how i 
i went and took the test and 
started that way 
well 
actually 
anybody can try 
you know there is a civil service exam you hafta take 
and 
they place you on a list from that 
and like say if you have an 
eighty 
well everybody that takes it after you that gets an eighty one 
is gonna get hired before you do 
uh so you can take it again but if you score lower you gotta keep that lower score so and that sometimes people are 
you know kind of 
apprehensive about doing that but 
uh once you pass that and then they say 
you know the government goes okay we're ready to hire 
a thousand people 
throughout the united states well each 
region there's regions in the united states they may get like thirty for the great lakes region 
so they go down the list the first thirty and they call 
you know they write each one of them and say 
we're offering you a position 
you know do you want it or not and you know some the people have said well 
i've been on the list for two years and i have a  
you know like you i have a job and i 
don't want it now you know so 
and then those people hafta go to oklahoma city to the academy and go through a screening program 
which is really hard 
because 
at one time only forty percent of the people were making it through that 
yeah 
so 
it's 
it's a really tough thing to do 
i mean you hafta be 
sort of organized 
and 
i don't know sort of a maverick i guess because 
if 
if you could 
give a test that would tell who could be an air 
traffic controller who couldn't you'd be a millionaire because the government would buy that from you 
because 
intelligence 
is not a factor  i mean there are people who do this job 
who 
i mean are not stupid 
but they're not 
college educated and really intelligent but they're extreme good at it 
and then the other people uh that 
i know of one 
that i work with  on a regular basis he is 
got a masters degree and he's 
you know 
he  reads continuously he's 
always up i mean if you ask him anything about like 
what's going on on 
overseas or anywhere 
he knows that like the back of his hand 
but he's one of our weakest ones 
you know and it's um 
right 
and 
and also the other thing is you  
you hafta be sort of compassionate because like 
you know you're 
you're working a lot of airplanes and you're wanting 
answers like this when you  something out you want an answer 
you know  each airplane is supposed to respond with their call sign like if i tell somebody you know turn left heading three six zero and he's supposed to respond t w a three ninety six roger 
well if he doesn't 
respond 
then i've got to say it again which means instead of 
ten airplanes i now have eleven i'm talking to because 
i hafta tell them 
talk to them two times each 
so you know there are some people that get 
really mad 
quick because they want 
that answer like that 
where 
you know 
i was a pilot so sometimes i'm thinking you know 

you're in there flying and you're 
turning and you're putting your flaps down and i go six nine eight juliet uh say your altitude and you're like um 
did they call me 
you know because you have a lot of things going on 
and i'm not i'd i'm i'm mister laid back in that area had a lot of people go i don't see how you can be so calm 
but 
you know i always look at it though as you know 
i can scare you to death and you will never come back to columbus 
or any 
airport that has a tower 
or i can be nice to you and you can go out and spread the word that 
you know 
there 
there's some people there that are pretty 
you know so i figure 
it's 
it's much better to be nice to them because 
there's also times when you know everybody makes 
errors 
and you know 
maybe one of these times you make an error and i tell you to turn one way and you go uh 
you know like there's an airplane over there and i tell you to turn that way 
and 
i really meant for you turn left instead of right and 
you may come back and go uh  
do you 
do you mean left or right there 
and 
i go 
yes that is  
correct turn left you know 
so you know 
everybody helps everybody out you know i i feel kindness goes a long way 
and the pilots the same way   
most often they're 
you know pretty decent 
no 
i don't i just got too expensive 
yeah 
i've never 
i've never known of him 
we don't know who's in the airplane and there but there are c planes that do come in and out of there 
very often i mean maybe like there's like one or two that come 
during the year 
but 
yeah i don't 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
now if you 
the the the thing you do is if you know the call sign 
and you know 
about what time 
of the year he's coming in 
you could call the operations over there and say 
you know 
is this airplane on the ground 
and you 
you could actually walk out and take a picture of it over there now at port columbus you couldn't do that 
but you could over there 
because you can walk around on the ramp over there 
at o s u 
sunday 
uh nothing for a  i don't want to do anything until past january 
you know because i've 
i 
like 
said it since nineteen seventy four i've never had thanksgiving 
christmas 
or new years off without having to work either 
a seven to three 
or a three to eleven 
you know and it's like i 
i figure i deserve this 
you know it's about time i get to 
not eat uh thanksgiving dinner at 
ten thirty in the morning so i can go to  
uh go to work at noon or something you know or 
or open the christmas presents uh 
you know at five o'clock in the afternoon because i work christmas day so you know 
i think it's 
my time 
yeah and 
you know i'd 
i would like to have another job but i would 
i would love 
i know you will say this is really stupid 
but i would love to have a monday through friday 
eight to five job never work another evening 
a saturday or a sunday 
if 
if it can be now i know i will probably not be able to do that because 
o s u wants me to come back there so 
as a contractor so 
i don't know 
you know 
you mean at o s u 
oh yeah i would have to work shift work 
yeah 
so 
yeah 
uhhum 
right 
yeah 
media hype 
yeah 
there is there's like two people who are like 
from the uh 
i mean they're not 
old but they're like from the forties and they have bought generators they've bought water they've got extra food they've got a  
extra freezers they bought ammunition it's like 
hello 
you know i just think it's 
you know the only thing i'm going to do 
is maybe two weeks before i might get a hundred dollars from the bank machine 
and uh 
i have three cars so i will probably have one of them full of gas 
and other than that it's like 
you know to me 
if you are say bank one 
and i'm huntington 
and january the  
second 
people have all kinds of problems 
you and i are going to be the laughing stock of the corporate america 
and do you really think you and i want to do that 
so to me 
nobody's gonna have a problem because 
they're gonna go 
remember bank one 
you know you go get ten bucks and you get five hundred out the machine 
uh you know it's like who wants to do business with them nobody's gonna do that 
yeah you know maybe some little company 
um that 
really doesn't 
you know have a big impact but 
i don't see where anything's gonna happen at all you know 
yeah 
i mean there are people who think cars won't run 
and it's like 
a car has a computer 
but it does not know 
if it is 
uh monday 
or 
two thousand and fifty it has no idea it 
it means nothing it's not date sensitive you know 
so 
she's a librarian at 
an elementary school 
one block from our house 
uhhum 
yeah 
it  it is she doesn't even drive to work 
you know 
so 
uh she's undecided right now 
um 
right uhhum 
at o yeah uh 
she really likes it well 
yeah 
she went to  
columbus alternative high school 
right uhhum 
uh college without the tuition 
so hard 
i mean 
every summer 
they have homework 
that has to be done 
or else the first grading period 
is an f 
and when 
uh my 
yeah oldest daughter went to northland first because she thought about being a teacher and they had a teaching academy there 
and once she got into it she went 
uh maybe not 
so i said well what you know whatever 
so then she wanted to go to  because it's basically 
a columbus 
public school that's geared to 
college only i mean if 
if you're not going to college 
don't go there because you will flunk out it's very hard 
and she got in 
the second year 
three weeks before school started 
and so we go over there and they hand her this stack of 
material that's got to be done in three weeks 
so i thought 
well i will just call and i called and i talked to the principal and i said you know they gave us all this stuff and you know 
everybody else has had 
june july 
august to get this done and she's got three weeks and she goes 
and the principal goes that's correct 
and i go 
well there's no way she can get this done and  i said you know everybody else has 
had all this time and she's gonna get it done in three weeks and they go 
that's right 
so they take 
there's no excuses 
you know 
and it's 
it is very hard i know my youngest daughter 
who is just as smart as my oldest would do horrible there because 
you know basically they say uh we're talking about china this week 
and uh 
on december the fifteenth 
we want a report on 
why chinese people do what they do 
you know and it's like 
and every week they don't come by and go have you started 
have you started 
have you started 
do you have the outline 
right 
and it's up to you to go gosh i have to have an outline i have to bibliography i have to have the facts i have to interview some people 
and if you don't sit down with a little calendar and go 
this week i'm getting this done this week i'm getting this done and this 
you just 
fail 
so my oldest daughter 
is pretty uh 
detail oriented so 
after we kind of   helped her start you know and say you know you're you're gonna hafta 
do these things 
so you get this done and i said and basically get it done like 
two weeks before it's done so then you can say 
oh 
this isn't very good and 
you know amend it or whatever or 
or 
help somebody 
you know get somebody with typing whatever so she's really good and it's 
it's helped her at school 
a lot 
because i know they 
uh she 
she toured here at ohio state and there were some people here that  
come from c a h s and they go 
this will be easier than your highschool 
so 
hum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
yeah 
uhhum 
yeah 
no because 
um 
all the kids take that  
california achievement test i don't know if you're familiar with that and it's like you know because 
it's 
say like you and i go to school you go to 
you go to dublin and i go to the worst school in columbus 
and we both make straight a's 
well when you take the california achievement test 
that really the 
a's mean nothing 
because it's like 
let's see what you understand and have learned 
the score on that is what really matters to me 
and both my daughters have really scored exceptionally high on those 
because you know they always pick on 
columbus public schools they go oh it's so look how bad their test scores 
well 
you know 
if you take 
say like uh 
the worst school in town which i don't know what it what it would be but lets just say it's uh 
brown school 
well you have 
children there who have not seen dad in probably 
ten years 
and mom is 
basically 
sometimes there 
or in prison so they live with grandma 
how do you expect them to do well 
nobody's there to you know i'm not a uh 
you know like 
an ogre or anything but you know 
i always keep 
tabs on my kids you know like i've always gone to conferences 
even though they got straight a's 
i go to conferences and teachers go well what do you come for and i go 
if i don't come then it's like saying 
i don't really care 
so i always go 
so they know that i'm 
keeping tabs on things and i don't demand a's 
i just demand them 
to do their best and i said you know if your best is a c then that's what it will be but i said if your best is an a and you're getting a c 
you got me to talk to so 
uh back to the brown school 
uh there are kids like my daughter there who make 
straight a's 
and when they take the 
um 
what is that thing the proficiency test 
zoom through it and get like outstanding on it 
and uh then you have 
uh  this probably sounds really 
biased or 
bigoted but  then you have 
the kid whose 
mom and dad aren't together and 
and he comes to school maybe 
twice a week 
and when he takes proficiency test he gets like a 
on it 
and his report card he's got like a one point two five average 
so they take 
jalena who has an a 
him who has a d and they go well gee the average  kid in the school is like c plus 
and they're stupid at this school columbus public schools don't do any good 
then you go to dublin worthington westerville 
in order to get there you 
you're not gonna be 
in his condition 
and you're not gonna be stupid because you're trying to 
you know 
you probably both husband and wife work 
so the intelligence is there 
and you're not gonna have dumb people 
living 
and going to those schools because it's very expensive live in that area 
so there's a natural prejudice that columbus is stupid 
and worthington dublin and it's really 
not true 
it's just that 
you know 
you can't 
tell all the poor people 
and the people that don't have 
two parents don't come to school because we want our scores higher 
but you know when the 
and when the news media goes look how bad brown school did this year 
but they don't look to see 
like jalena 
they don't go well look at 
the uh scores on the california achievement tests there's like 
seventy five percent the kids that are getting like 
you know nineties and above 
but twenty five percent are getting 
f's and d's 
so it brings that  and it's uh like you know they're they're not comparing it fairly if you would take all the people who are making the same score on 
the test at both schools 
i will bet you they're all about the same 
because like i think it's archie griffin that went to a really crummy school in uh 
in in columbus 
and to me 
no matter how 
bad of an area you live in and and  bad a  bad a school you think you're going to 
if you want to do it 
you can 
because it and 
really in columbus public schools 
if you have a learning disability 
or you know if you have problems reading or you have problems at home there is 
a psychologist 
or a tutor or something to help you and 
and in uh like 
worthington and westerville dublin 
you know 
they don't have the money to throw away and like catholic schools they don't have the money to put on those programs so some of those people kind of get 
pushed aside and 
so you know 
as you can see i'm standing on my soapbox here i do like columbus public schools but you know i 
i i hate when people say you know look at these test scores because it really doesn't reflect what's there because 
it's like saying all kids carry guns to school 
they don't 
you know and the media says well what has there been like maybe 
five or six 
people who have taken guns to school and killed people 
well what about the uh 
millions and millions of kids that go to school every day 
do their homework 
and you know 
do community service and stuff well well 
well that's just to boring we don't want to hear that stuff 
you know 
it's like 
that that irritates me 
oh 
there we go 
uhhum 
uhhum 
right 
uhhum 
right 
uhhum 
uh they really have no self worth 
because 
you know uh i uh i know a long time ago uh we went to a um 
uh  
what was  it's like a 
a seminar 
for the 
ivy league schools which 
i looked at the tuition and went 
you know there was no way but 
and i thought this is so stupid to be here but i listened to the man 
there was like four or five men talking and some women talking whatever and uh 
they said you know 
if your  
if your child makes straight a's 
and uh 
applies at our school 
we don't want them 
and i'm like 
what 
he says uh 
he says we look at two 
two children sitting side by side this one's making straight a's 
this one sort of made b's 
but this one over here got into track when 
he or she was in freshman's 
and 
and we noticed 
every track meet 
they basically  
were like 
last 
or second to last 
but they did it for four years 
then they  
yeah 
and and never got any better 
then they got in marching band 
and 
they were in that for four years 
and sometimes we notice they marched and sometimes they didn't because they didn't learn their music 
but they stayed with it 
and they said then they like volunteered down at cosi 
they didn't get paid a dime for this 
but they did it because they enjoyed 
helping and definite so like they go 
we want that student over there 
said you as a straight a student have proved nothing to us 
and you over there as a b student have proved that 
by gosh 
you know you will try out for something 
and if you don't do well you go 
but i like doing it 
and i'm gonna keep with it 
you know 
and to me 
the straight a student who does nothing 
is like the kids who 
go to school and shoot people 
they have nothing in their life 
at all and the other one has 
you know activities and 
they're giving of themselves to the community you know 
you know like my both my daughters have like volunteered for the library  
reading program and then they went on and they volunteer at cosi and 
and my oldest one was in key club and they would have like 
easter egg hunts for 
the 
school is a grade school and it's attached to  
columbus alternative high school 
so 
um you know i  i read an 
um 
uh a uh resume that she 
put in 
for a scholarship and it was explaining how 
the 
the closest she got to crying at school was 
when she would 
uh 
do these projects because she says there were kids there that she knew had no easter candy 
and  
it was just 
they were just so excited that 
the kids went out and bought like a dollar or twos worth of candy and hid it out and they'd have an easter egg hunt for them at school and she says 
you know those and things that 
were important to her and 
you know 
to me that makes 
you feel like you're worth something but the kids that go you know the ones who went to school i 
you know i don't see any 
community service or 
i don't know about 
i i'm not a big 
gung ho have to be religious person i mean i i feel i'm a christian but i'm not a church goer 
and i don't think you hafta go there to be 
a religious person 
you know but uh you know i think 
religion and community service and 
feeling like you have given something to the community and 
you know you're just not 
asking continuously for it you know and and trying things 
and failing at them 
and going okay well 
but i still like to 
play basketball 
i'm 
terrible but i like to play and i can't make the team so what do i do i know i will go to the y and play there 
you know 
that 
that's 
what keeps kids out of trouble 
and those that go to school and come home and either sit on the computer and 
you know what 
do the chat room stuff or the e mail stuff or sit on the playing with video games i think those the ones that are the big problem children because they you know mom and dad go 
how can i get them to do something 
and stay out of my hair 
oh i know i will buy them a nintendo 
i will buy them this sega i will buy this look they're out of my way you know because 
you know 
oh yeah 
and 
and 
i i will probably step on your toes here but i i'm not a firm believer of mom and dad both working 
i my wife worked 
until we had children then she stayed home and once they got into school she worked 
at a school 
so when they were gone she was gone when they were home she was home 
and you know my parents didn't do that and i hated it 
i hated coming home from school by myself every day 
there was nobody there to talk to you know and i did it for years and 
and 
i just feel that 
you know 
i i hope you don't have children yet 
do you 
good 
because 
to me parents who 
put kids in daycare 
and 
uh you know after school programs 
are like people who have cats and dogs 
i get up in the morning 
and i feed my 
pet 
my child 
then i put him in the kennel 
and i go to work 
and i go gee i'd like to go for some drinks after work or go to a movie 
we will just put her in another kennel after work and we take her from one kennel to the other kennel we go we will be back a little bit 
and then i go and i have all my fun and i go pick her up at the kennel and i bring her home and i dust her off 
and feed her 
and i go 
don't bother me 
i've had a bad day and i'm tired 
you go watch t v 
and how are we raising children 
doing that you know 
you know and  people say uh you hafta have both those incomes because we hafta do this i go 
well why do you hafta have a house that's three hundred thousand dollars 
why do you have have a brand new car 
you know isn't life sacrifices  
aren't 
aren't you supposed to like 
do best for your children you know i mean i 
my children don't have everything they don't have a 
sega 
you know my daughter has a car that goes to  
and it's twelve years old 
you know 
and i made her buy it 
i told her i says 
i will not buy you a car 
i said if you want a car you hafta buy it 
and i said when it's time for maintenance you have to pay for it 
because 
she has to be responsible for things 
and she appreciates that you know and 
you know 
i admire her i mean she's the 
person i 
never was that age you know 
but 
you know and 
i'd 
i don't take 
full responsibility for that but 
i'm very proud of the way her and her sister are but 
i just think it's because mom was home 
and 
you know there was somebody there to listen to them and it doesn't have to be mom i mean 
um 
you know 
mom can go work 
and dad can stay home 
there's nothing wrong with that either but i just think they need 
mom or dad there everyday when they come home so they know when they come home and they've had a really bad day and something's really bothering them 
they can talk to it as opposed to sitting for two or three hours 
and letting it kind of fade away and then when everybody comes home it's like well 
how how's school 
okay 
you know 
anything bothering you 
no 
you know 
so 
oh there we go 
okay 
uhhum 
yeah 
well you're very smart 
you know 
yeah 
uhhum 
yeah 
right 
and  well 
and there's nothing wrong with that 
oh yeah 
uhhum 
uhhum 
yeah 
right 
uhhum 
oh yeah 
right 
right 
uhhum 
exactly 
uhhum 
right 
and it's all the bucks 
yeah because people i work with you know 
uh 
there uh there are some people i work with that house payments 
one guy he has the biggest 
twenty two hundred dollars a month 
and a lot of them have like 
fifteen hundred and up 
and you know 
i bought my house 
years and years ago and it's like four eighty five 
and i wouldn't dare tell them that 
but it's like you know they because they're always 
at 
you know there are people there that make a lot more money than i do and 
and they're always like 
broke 
but yet you know like when they go do something they've gotta have the best of everything the best of  it's like you know 
you know you i 
to me you just hafta kind of think about things little bit and it's like 
you know do i 
do i really need to go to um 
oh what'd i say um 
uh 
t g i fridays 
for lunch 
and spend twelve dollars 
can i go to taco bell and spend like three 
and use the other part for maybe like a book for my kid 
or you know uh they have like my daughter is in swimming 
i need the money for a swimsuit 
well why don't i use it for that 
you know so it's 
uhhum 
right 
uhhum 
me too 
uhhum 
right 
uhhum 
it's like a car dealer goes you know 
the 
uh 
c d player 
with the blah blah blah blah 
will only raise your payment 
another 
eight dollars 
and you're like yeah but 
that's about the fourteenth 
eight dollars you've added onto this you know and it all adds up 
exactly right 
yeah 
yeah 
and you know a lot of people i work with don't see that and you know they think i'm a real cheapskate 
you know because you know i  i spend money 
you know it well i i'm very selective i mean like uh i'd love to go to disney world 
and there are people at work that will not go to disney world just because of what it costs to get in you know 
now i drive there 
i don't fly because i'm really that cheap 
but you know i'd love to fly but i just go oh my gosh and uh 
you know but 
you know i will do that 
but you know like um 
like at uh thanksgiving time we don't buy a butterball turkey we buy 
a meijer 
and it's like 
it's just as good you know and you know we make do you know 
oh yeah 
you don't  
you don't use coupons 
you know why 
right 
because 
everything that has a coupon has 
tons of fat 
tons of sugar 
and is overpriced 
yeah 
right 
well here's 
here's a can of manwich it's a dollar fifty and we will give you fifty cents off 
well 
gee 
if i just use the recipe out the microwave cookbook 
i can make it at home for like three cents 
but but you know why 
it's convenience 
i can throw it in the microwave and it will be done in five minutes you know like mashed potatoes the microwave or you know it's like hello it's 
you know 
i  i can understand how people do it because 
they come home from work 
and it's like 
i don't want to be a cook 
i don't want to be a clean up so i will pay somebody do this pay somebody do that and pretty soon you see 
all the money they've been making 
gone 
you know and 
yeah 
yeah 
uhhum 
oh my gosh they just 
price is so high 
right 
right 
exactly 
oh you're 
you're in our neighborhood 
yeah you're 
exactly 
oh 
well 
we use 
i'm trying to think  
it they're  
it's a meijer brand i know that's what we have 
it's like fruit o's instead of uh  
fruit loops 
yeah 
and it's like what 
is the difference you know 
besides the price 
it is yeah 
right 
right 
well you know my and my girls 
there are certain products that 
brand name like 
uh one of them i know is the meijer 
uh pudding that you can uh take  for lunches which they do 
and it's like edventure 
you know 
adventure but it's edventure 
well 
every once in while hunts will be 
the same price 
and they will be a coupon in the paper 
so joyce will or joyce or i we 
we trade she goes the grocery store 
once then 
next two weeks i go 
and the next two weeks she goes 
so um 
she will uh  you know she will buy stuff like that with a coupon and she goes 
and i go why are you buying that and she goes 
it was cheaper than the 
meijer brand 
and then when we 
eat it 
it's like 
it's too sweet 
you know or it's too overpowering or too sugary 
and the girls even they the same way they would go we don't like this it's too chocolatey 
so you know like the manwich stuff it's like they just 
pour sugar in it i guess because that's what people like and so i find that 
the unbrand stuff well not unbrand but 
it's all like a meijer brand or something like that or food club or something like that 
yeah 
oh we do too we make vegetable soup and 
chili 
oh yeah 
yeah 
right 
yeah 
right 
exactly 
yeah 
well see 
the 
you 
you're 
you're intelligent 
you know 
and the house smells wonderful 
you know 
it's like cakes uh birthday cakes you know i think 
but my i think my wife's was the last one i 
i make her one and you know we 
we trade off 
and i bought 
a um 
um what is it betty crocker 
at odd lots 
it was twenty two cents 
the icing was twenty two cents i made it and everybody goes 
this is really good it's like a sour cream icing i go yeah and they go boy this is really good they go did you buy this and i go no i made it they go 
really like oh yeah it cost me forty four cents 
and i go the same cake at meijer would have been like seven dollars or something like that and you know 
but uh you know i'm 
i don't try to be the 
the cheapskate i mean i won't go without health plan or anything like that but 
you know there are certain  
like my car i love cars and 
you know 
you  take the car to carwash it's like seven fifty or eight bucks and you wash in the driveway and it's about a quarter 
you know it's like 
it takes time 
if you 
if you have no time and you know that i 
i have friends at work that 
their  the mom is a taxi cab driver 
and the dad is the worker bee 
and when they get home they don't want to do anything so they pay to have the yard done they do this 
and it's like they have and then they always go we have no money 
and it's like 
because you'd 
pay to do everything you know slow your life down a little bit you know 
it's 
it's like you making your soup 
you know 
when if and when you have children 
when they get my age they're gonna go 
i can remember walking around the house and going 
mom is making bean soup 
or mom is making vegetable soup or mom baked a cake 
it's like 
uh as opposed to 
open it up 
oh here's a meijer cake 
you know 
it's a lot of memories 
uhhum 
yeah 
right 
i have a neighbor that's that way 
i  well to me 
the cholesterol level 
and the health 
from that food has gotta be so bad i mean 
uh my my only downfall is i love taco bell 
so when i'm like 
working out in the yard 
and mowing and edging and trimming and wash the car and it's look up at my watch and i go 
oh hell i deserve a break i'm going out to lunch 
well most people would go somewhere really expensive i go 
what 
i want a mexican pizza and a coke 
so that's my big treat 
but uh you know i um 
i i'm not a big 
fan of eating out either i mean we do like to go to chinese restaurant but 
and uh when i go we have something nice but um 
you know we're not cheap but we don't go 
like we  
we do go to movies every once in a while but you know we do get a lot from the library 
because they're free 
but uh you know like they're 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
right 
like magazines 
i i love read magazines and my wife loves reading magazines because i love all the car magazines 
and they're a fortune 
and they're all at the library 
you know it's like people just don't 
you pay all these taxes 
and you don't use this stuff 
i mean 
the library has c d's 
i mean 
uh 
my thing now is 
uh 
in traffic everybody gets all upset that this big road rage crap 
you know which is just 
and i'd just love to slap a couple of them people but anyway 
and what i do is 
i go to the library on my day off and i get two or three books on tape 
and when i'm sitting there i go 
oh good 
it's a traffic jam and i'm not moving as i'm 
yeah 
and i'm going oh this is really interesting you know and then i will drive along and people are just like 
and blowing the horns and i'm like well i could  
careless this means i get to hear more of my book 
and 
why don't people use their time you know and 
it's free 
you know 
rather they get all 
tensed up and mad because 
they left five minutes late and expect everybody to get out of the way because they got to get there you know 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uh well my oldest one this is 
really odd because 
uh the school she goes to 
it's sort of like uh thrift store 
chic 
and a lot of kids there go to thrift stores and buy their clothes and i told her i said you know 
we are not in the poor house you're not buying clothes in the thrift store 
so she basically went through my closet and took 
everything that was old of mine 
and wore it 
and i thought oh my gosh you know because she just looks like a bum 
i think 
and you know when it was time for like a um 
a 
a dance or something 
she would go out and buy 
a dress you know at 
penny's or someplace at the mall you know and maybe spend like eighty dollars for a dress 
and the same thing would happen 
every time she would go and come home i'd go what did they say 
you know about 
your dress and she goes 
jalena 
is that you 
and i go see you clean up really nice i said you know you have the best shape you're ever gone have in your life and what do you do you wear these big baggy clothes and these saggy pants i said 
you know when you get 
when you get in your fifties and you've got a gut and a big ass 
you could do that 
why are you doing it now but 
and then my my my youngest one she likes to dress 
totally different she's sort of like uh little bit of a preppy 
but she 
uh does not understand why people want to have 
like 
izod on their shirt 
or you know a name on their pants 
and she says 
i just think that's stupid she says you can buy nice clothes 
without that 
so 
she's 
neither one of them pressure me and uh 
the one thing that was really 
odd when they  little is 
we would go like to toys r us 
and 
up and down the rows 
and 
i see kids it's like in y you know 
and they would walk over 
and pick something up and go 
and then put it back down 
and keep walking and it's like you know i told joyce i says you know i feel like i'm an 
ogre because 
are they terrified to even 
ask for this stuff 
and she goes no she says 
they don't want it 
she says they just want to see what it's like 
you know because their favorite toy when they were little is i would go to um 
um 
what do you call it lazy boy 
and get five or six of them killer boxes from the sofas and the chairs 
and take a knife 
and cut doors in it 
and they would play with that for weeks you know 
until somebody one of their friends would come over and have a little accident and then we go well we hafta build a new house but you know 
they just 
reading and playing with stuff like that they they enjoyed you know so 
right 
yeah 
yeah well my oldest my oldest daughter is the biggest cheapskate 
you know 
because 
i keep asking her when i 
you know when i call her on the phone or i 
e mail her every day 
you know and she goes 
i said do you are you out of money and she goes 
well i have like three dollars but i'm not going to the bank machine because you're picking me up tuesday 
and i'm not paying a two 
service  
service  uh charge to get money 
out 
i will wait till i get home and i'm like 
you know 
i can't complain 
uh 
yeah yeah 
because if she was they're charging her two bucks down there and i told her i says you need to really not get twenty dollars out at a time 
because i said you need to get like sixty or eighty 
because i says you get eighty bucks out you're gonna pay 
eight dollars for it twenty bucks at a time but if you get eighty bucks out you're gonna get 
two bucks and she goes but if i have eighty dollars i will spend it 
and i says well you have a footlocker with a lock on it 
put 
seventy dollars 
in there 
and have ten on you and she's like 
oh 
and i said 
the  i know that's because that's what dad's gotta do 
i said i can't carry money or i will spend it you know 
oh yeah by the 
oh yeah 
yeah 
oh yeah 
right 
uhhum 
right 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
right because 
uh  
you'd like 
uh i 
i always keep using my oldest daughter 
uh she can 
uh 
get up in the morning 
and brush her teeth 
and just 
barely comb her hair put on a shirt 
and a pair of pants 
and go somewhere 
because she's comfortable with herself 
she doesn't hafta be made up 
she doesn't hafta look perfect now my youngest one hasta do that 
and and the oldest one i look at her as 
you know 
i like myself 
and 
if you don't like me 
well 
then move on 
maybe somebody else 
does 
and that's way i'm gonna be you know and and  like i said she can clean up and look like a beauty queen 
but she can also look 
just 
like 
you know just 
basically you know like 
she was 
raking leaves ten minutes ago 
and my other one will not leave the house 
without looking perfect and i just think that's sort of 
shallow because 
you know i look at people who got to you know they hafta have the face lifts and they got to have the perfect hair and they got to have the perfect clothes it's like 
you're so 
insecure about 
the 
image you present that you've got to be perfect and by gosh if your hair is out of place 
you're gonna be 
out of the loop 
and you know if 
if people were just a little more comfortable with themselves 
you know and i've like i'm a big one to talk i was like mister insecure for 
thirty years at least then i finally got the point and i went oh the hell with it you know it's too much work 
you know you either like me or don't if you don't go to somebody else and 
you know 
a lot of people are uh are really worried and you know 
i don't know if boys so much but i know girls are really worried about what people think of them 
and how they look 
and it's like um 
you know why don't you kind of like 
go past the outside and go inside because you know 
um my wife was saying the other day she says uh well i'm getting wrinkles and i'm 
i'm thinning on top and 
and i go 
well 
obviously you're not looking too close 
at 
me 
because i said you know mother nature has a way of making your vision get a little worse 
as time goes by and i 
honestly feel 
it's so that that 
tight butt 
tight skinned  woman that you married who is not there anymore 
still kind of looks that way because 
you know it's 
you know 
yeah 
right 
exactly yeah 
you know and 
you know it's like uh 
i 
i 
honestly feel the older you get the more you 
kind of look at 
what's in there 
as opposed to 
you know gosh that's 
just 
a  four hundred dollar dress and a three hundred dollar hair do and 
you know what does that mean you know it's like uh 
when we're food for maggots 
my feeling is uh 
some people they're gonna say 
gee she had a really big house 
and some other people are gonna go 
gosh she did work 
in this area for 
free and she volunteered at this and she did this and she did this and this 
and they're gonna go 
oh 
you know it's like you know what 
what 
what do you want at the very end you know 
so 
yeah 
you  
you can't have a beer gut and a big ass 
and it means you're 
it means you're sloppy 
and lazy if you do but if a man does it's like by god he's probably got some power behind him and it's like 
duh he's probably just as lazy as 
anybody else it's like you know i've 
you know i hate to see girls starve themselves to death 
you know it's like uh you know 
there are certain times in your life where you're gonna be fat 
you know 
you know my my youngest daughter has a problem with that you know 
she's 
i don't know why she's so insecure because she out of the four of us including her sister 
is like 
you know right at the top i mean she has done television commercials she's done radio voice overs 
she's been in plays 
and 
she was in a  
highschool play 
when she was in  
uh a kindergarten student 
and 
actually had speaking part 
and i'm sitting there in the audience like 
in tears 
because 
and i'd i'm like why am i crying but it's like you know how can she do this and you know like 
you see her i saw her in a few tv commercials and i'm like 
i tried to do that 
and if you can picture 
driving along a highway at night with your bright lights on and a deer doing this 
that's about how good i am in those and she's just like 
you know 
and she's 
she's not a smart ass you know she doesn't show off but she's just so relaxed doing this and it's 
it looks so natural 
but she doesn't see that 
because you know you know uh she always 
thinks she's very uh 
mediocre uh and i go but janelle i said 
you know you've been in front of television cameras 
and you do so well i said you get on the radio you do well i said you do well in school you have a ton of friends 
i said you have a great body i said 
you know 
i said 
i never compare the two of them but 
there are sometimes when i hafta i said look at your sister she has the same chest 
i do 
i said you definitely are well built there 
i said you have a nice shape i said when you have a bathing suit on it's like 
i go 
somebody put a towel on her 
you know and i said you know you just don't realize 
all the physical 
and 
and also the character attributes you have i said you have a great personality i said you go in a room of a hundred people 
with me 
and your sister 
and about three days later somebody will go 
john and jalena who 
but in ten minutes they will go where's janelle at 
because they 
all know you 
you're just 
so 
easy to get along with and everybody likes you and i said you just don't realize 
this gigantic list of character 
physical and mental traits you have 
that 
i can never even come close to having 

and i said 
you know i don't know why you 
are insecure 
i said 
everything you do you do well 
i said 
i 
i try things and just bomb at them and i said 
you just zip through them and i said 
you'd 
maybe some day when you're 
older you will look back and go 
oh i see what dad was talking about but she just can't see that 
um 
yeah 
right 
yeah 
yeah 
if 
if she passed a hundred people 
and ninety nine of them said 
oh that's really pretty hair 
oh those are nice earrings oh that's a nice shirt those are nice pants 
and one guy goes 
what's with that 
uh lipstick 
she will remember that what's with that lipstick 
for about a month 
and i'm like 
gosh 
you know 
you know 
and that's sad 
yeah 
because i told her things like i said you know what you really need to do is like in the morning when you're all done dressed you need to look the mirror and go 
i look pretty good today 
or 
when you've done something like say uh she's in a play right now 
and when you come home at night 
you need to look in the mirror and go 
i did pretty good at the play today 
other people 
did well but 
i think i did the best i've done so far you know 
and  uh 
and it's not to make yourself an egomaniac 
it's just to 
you know that's like those little subtle hints 
yeah that and i think 
i i'm a firm believer that uh 
little subtleties like that to yourself 
are much better than look in the mirror and going 
look at them hips 
and you go this one you go 
i'm getting a gut 
and you know it's like that's so negative to  would you 
tell your 
mom that 
you know 
yeah hey everybody has it 
right 
uhhum 
right 
yeah 
yeah 
i mean uh i  
i had parents that 
everything i did was negative i mean they just told me i couldn't do this couldn't do that and 
and so what i try to do is when anything comes up 
i always think of how my parents would handle it 
and i do a hundred and eighty degrees 
so you know because the you know they just 
i don't know how i got 
i sort of feel i'm mentally okay now but i don't know how i got here because 
i've been the other way it hurt me you know and it's well you know 
yeah 
yeah 
okay 

i've 
yeah i've been here pretty much all my life until 
just recent weeks when i moved up to 
it's 
it's a real comfort 
you know 
comfort for me because everybody 
pretty much 
around where we used to live just 
you know it gets worse and worse 
you know the 
crime you can't really stop and 
other things that happen 
just 
you know too much partying around 
i mean that's why i left twelfth 
because i couldn't 
you know 
but 
you know just everybody uh the neighbors being loud and 
everything and my mom's 
older so she can't really put up with any of that 
and 
well i lived on twelfth 
maybe about four or five years ago 
probably longer but 
that was just for a summer thing 
you know 
after i saw all the couches being burned i said 
yeah they was burning couches and uh 
over by pearl alley they was actually 
rolling 
a volkswagen 
down the 
man there was all kinds of people doing it 
just people coming from high street and just 
happen 
happen to be centralized right there on twelfth avenue 
yeah 
pretty much 
yeah 
easy come easy go follow the leader monkey in the middle whatever 
oh 
that was a football game deal 
uh i think they lost 
think ohio state lost because they was just out there 
ranting and raving and 
after a while it got out of hand and i 
i had to pack it up 
uh a little bit 
north of north broadway 
right along the freeway there 
um didn't used to be a bad neighborhood but now it's just kind of 
you got the 
little kids growing up and 
doing shit that 
you know 
you picture yourself doing as a child 
one way or another 
you know 
now you 
throw rocks around and stuff and 
accidentally break a window run away 
well 
yeah it's 
i just give you a rough 
estimate of uh 
two and a half miles from here 
well it was both 
really 
because there's  
kids lived there since i lived there 
that was thirteen years ago 
huh 
and being that long in the same neighborhood just doesn't really get it with me 
yeah it got boring it got frustrating because we uh 
you get these 
new people moving in and 
you know you're used to 
everything being 
nice you know and then got people 
next door breaking into you or upstairs from you breaking into each just 
well yeah we got broke into uh i think twice 
and stuff got stolen 
my trucks been broken into 
my moms cars been 
broken into 
the gas siphoned 
pretty much everybody around there's been uh 
criminalized one way or another 
it seems like it 
just about everywhere on that street is uh 
one way or another criminal 
well number one it's a 
little bit smaller 
more 
controlled area 
quiet no less and uh 
get my mom closer to the sister 
you know my sister lives up there 
she moved there from uh 
down in west virginia 
so 
you know with mom having all the 
peace and 
peace and quiet 
she 
you know plus in a 
place that's 
only 
year old 
you know just 
apartments we was living it's just 
god i mean seems like a hundred years old 
fire hazards 
no 
over on um 
beulah 
you know where that 
over by north broadway 
where i said 
so 
yeah those places were probably about 
thirty years old i  
no 
fire hazards 
insulation just 
you know 
fire hazard everywhere 
yeah it's 
it's a change of pace and plus being around my sister instead of 
you know 
taking a 
twenty mile lag all the way out there just 
go a couple blocks over and there she is 
yeah i 
actually have 
bunch of numbers here that 
hope i didn't lose yeah i got uh 
three people to call 
see about jobs there 
should be in within 
middle the week 
yeah because 
gas money's 
i can do construction cooking 
actually took 
columbus public schools cooking test and passed it 
so i'm 
technically 
a cook 
oh i can 
whip up a mean fish 
especially when i 
go out 
we're closer to the fishing area now 
i caught dinner the other night 
and uh 
heck just about anything i can 
i'd like to get a 
patent on a 
certain kind of 
omelet i'm not gonna 
you know 
yeah well 
it's just uh 
you know grilled cheese omelet 
you know it's 
make it like grilled cheese except 
omelet 
and cheese and 
all your goodies inside 
yeah 
got a little secret recipe to throw in a little bit of this and that into 
tastes pretty good too 
yeah it's a  
good growing area 
the job prospects are 
um 
little scarce 
you know because the 
smaller town but 
yeah there's only about a one percent 
unemployment rate there 
yeah that's what i said 
i'm the one percent that's 
yeah 
yeah there's uh 
some people there just 
get lazy 
then you got the 
college students they 
i don't know how many of them work but most of them there's just from out of town 
westland 
that's up in delaware 
and uh 
most of them that i talk to 
you know i haven't been there a while so i haven't really talked to a whole 
population of students but 
the ones i did talk to 
even they're 
you know 
professor 
and whatever they're majoring in 
we was out 
you know and hanging out at the bar 
they was doing karaoke oh man you should've saw them do hang on 
yeah 
he was up there too 
the old guy with 
beard and uh 
tweed jacket 
you know 
it was pretty cool 
and uh they said most 
you know most of the students are not even from Delaware 
yeah 
most of them 
some of them transfer from 
up north and out east and indiana and 
just different walks of life you know 
yeah most of them do 
you know and then 
you know pretty much the rest of them just 
hang out 
go to school 
well yeah 
you get a lot of those 
yeah most them think the freshman class just ride along 
i think the freshmen  
would be 
little bit tougher you know 
it'd be tougher to be 
walking around 
knowing different areas 
like me i didn't know where this 
hall was i was out there with 
fifty million halls around me and 
just stopped once and i said where's lazenby and they 
that way 
not too far from where i parked 
no i parked over here on uh 
uh 
me see 
the a section 
goes back in 
uhhum 
yeah 

it's like right 
yeah and it's uh and it's 
not too bad because 
i had to 
scratch off your 
ticket you gave me 
those things are hard as hell to scratch 
took 
took my key and 
yeah they won't bother it 
oh i'm kind of mad at my team at the moment 
green bay packers 
and you probably know that they're 
well they're four and 
think they're four and five right now 
oh my gosh 
alright 
yeah 
they went and won the super bowl and they went back and 
lost the super bowl 
so 
yeah i've been a 
fan  
you know forever pretty much 
i didn't really have any other teams 
just watched it 
and uh 
you know they lost yesterday 
the cowboys 
yeah 
so where were you out of uh 
overseas 
oh man 
that is 
couple miles 
by time you get there you're all lagged out and 
hum 
man i'd like to go out there 
overseas somewhere 
i haven't even been anywhere except for canada 
and uh 
um 
niagara falls 
i was 
about three years old 
yeah that's when my dad died and 
while we was up there no less so 
yeah being three i didn't really 
know anything 
heart attack 
ate too much of that good stuff 
yeah we was going up there to 
can't really remember 
you know it's been 
twenty years ago 
and 
i just 
you know i don't have any 
real recollection 
of the times and 
memories and stuff 
yeah 
yeah i have a brother and 
two sisters 
yeah 
kind of balance the brother out a little bit 
youngest 
yeah so i get a lot of 
you know what from my sisters 
yeah 
my brother 
well 
he's 
the oldest oldest but 
two sisters pretty much 
all the ones i really care about 
two sisters and 
their husbands 
yeah 
no 
oh man that was 
i was trying to avoid that 
no but uh 
i thought you know just get a little  
insight 
on what's going on out there in delaware and 
you know  
maybe possibly find someone to be with but 
not right now i'm 
kind of 
job 
motivated 
trying to get 
that job 
that would just 
you know send me into the 
new millennium or 
whatever you want to 
yeah my one sister 
my older sister she's uh 
got one 
son 
he's 
no she's she still lives down here 
my other sister has two 
niece and my nephew 
yeah and 
got more people to buy presents for though 
yeah 
well i 
i think with them they just need to get their heads out of the ground and 
you know 
look all over the place for 
different plays you look on 
the screen it's different you say well i would've done this and this and this but 
you know down on the field they hafta think that 
they're gonna be doing this 
you know 
it really doesn't look like 
i mean 
they're trying 
it just doesn't seem like they're thinking 
ahead 
yeah 
avoiding  
mistakes is pretty much what they need to do 
better decisions would help 
well the coach he's pretty much got it all together 
you know he just needs to 
put everybody in their own separate category 
instead of having 
one person for one 
part of the team and then another person for another part of the team and 
no i'm 
i'm not really 
up on the coaching thing i mean 
anybody can coach a game it 
takes 
players to play the game 
well quarterbacks got a 
injury to his hand 
i mean he still does good he just 
he needs to focus in on who he's throwing at instead of throwing it fifty miles down the 
road 
he's done that a couple times yesterday 
and uh 
watching out who he's 
throwing to 
you know 
might help to 
yeah i 
i like uh football and pool 
yeah 
i like to go up there and play pool 
once in a while 
pretty much anywhere in delaware that i can find 
no well one place is here one place is right across street from it so i got two to choose 
just a road over from me 
i'm rusty 
got a pool 
if you've got a pool table over 
down the hall i will show you 
it's kind of 
yeah 
no we used to do uh 
fifty cents 
you know 
a game 
you know just to win back the quarters and 
plop them in 
you know 
not too much gambling on that part 
yeah 
play the lottery once in a while if i have couple bucks on me 
and uh 
well football games we won't even start with that 
i uh 
i make side 
little side 
bets 
not 
necessarily money 
you know just 
ha ha for fun 
sometimes i did get money for it though 
wasn't too bad i mean you know it's not like some kind of racketeering deal 
the feds have me tapped now i'm busted 
oh yeah 
bug the room 
yeah they'd get my loan shark in trouble 
yeah it hasn't it hasn't gone far as  
loan sharking 
but 
you know the 
the thing of it is 
it's 
fun when you win 
and it's 
still fun when you lose 
i mean 
you know just 

i'm sitting here now scott i bet you on monday nights game tonight nine o'clock la la la so and so will win 
you know and we 
don't 
exchange any money or have any money figures planned out just 
you know 
oh well that's your team that's 
my team lets 
go at it 
yeah 
and it makes it 
you know fun so you can 
actually see what 
you know your 
studying these teams 
does you know 
you can go a whole season 
you know seventeen eighteen and o 
and 
nobody's 
pretty much coming close to your standard and 
when you win all that money it's just like yeah when you lose all that money it's like 
that's it 
going home 
but 
i've known people that gamble 
you know compulsively 
i mean it's like a  
gamblers anonymous 
level 
i couldn't really get into that 
number one i'm not the richest person in the world and number two 
just 
little money here is one thing but 
when you're  
out there spending your 
car insurance money on it or 
rent money then 
you got a real problem there 
i've seen guys do that to 
go down to scioto downs and bet the 
bet the farm on 
one horse and 
wouldn't even do anything for them 
well you got the 
casinos 
river boat casinos open you got 
all the 
pretty much every 
store on the corners got a 
lottery machine or 
tickets 
i think it is a good idea because i've won my fair share of money 
they give everybody a fair chance you know they don't 
just 
minimize it to one or two 
you know 
some of them have options 
and some of them don't 
yeah it's 
just like uh 
having alcohol around 
mean 
gambling is a lot like alcohol it can be addicting it can screw your life up and 
you will spend your last dollar on it if you're that far gone 
so pretty much anything can be 
one of those factors 
well most people think it's 
something they rely on like 
well the 
money getting 
from the lottery to the people or 
lottery to schools 
on that issue then yeah i 
i agree with 
the gambling thing 
you know 
just as long as it's 
like 
social drinking 
in a sense 
because if you have people just 
go out 
like today i  
i bought a one dollar lottery ticket won two bucks off of it 
so i kept my one dollar and uh 
got a one dollar added on 
yeah there's 
and then 
then there's these um 
little bit more expensive cards you buy the 
lottery cards 
one of them's called battleship that i've 
won 
lot of money off of 
well you hafta 
it's just like bingo numbers 
and you uh 
it's just like the game battleship pretty much 
you know 
a four a two a seven 
and um 
well off a three dollar one i've won 
probably 
four out of five 
you know 
in that 
i haven't bought that many of them but in that 
race 
right there four out of fives not too bad 
got my mom one on her birthday she got fifteen dollars 
and 
the other times i get them i either win 
my three dollars back 
or 
i won nine dollars 
hm 
yeah 
yeah 
that could really bite you in the back though 
winning all that money 
i'd be 
well i'd be 
quite content with one million dollars but 
ten million dollars is kind of like over kill 
i mean do you think anybody in this town has ten million dollars 
well 
maybe a couple 
people 
yeah 
probably hafta go to dublin or 
you know 
worthington somewhere around there to find 
couple millionaires 
but uh 
mm 
yeah 
give some charity and 
keep care of your bills and 
probably go on that vacation you been dying for 
like you're making my brain water here over 
australia 
well yeah 
it's kind of like making your mouth water when you see food 
and this is my consent 
to let you use that 
yeah 
uhhum 
i went to 
a lot of them 
i went 
middle school i went to 
clinton 
and indianola 
high school i went to brookhaven 
and fort hayes 
and 
well they're 
yeah one's a 
alternative school and the other one's just a 
regular trashy public school 
well 
this is about giving opinions and 
my opinion about the columbus public school system really 
isn't good 
well because i've been in public schools all my life and i should be 
first to know that there's uh 
lot of 
favoritism 
you know 
some 
some teachers will 
teach 
one but not teach the other 
well if 
yeah teach one person 
one thing 
and 
not teach the other person that 
kind of 
let me see here 
give an example there's uh 
there's a school that they showed on twenty twenty 
somewhere out west 
i believe it's nevada or somewhere 
and they said that 
these uh 
teachers have the highest rating 
among 
many other teachers 
in the nation because of their 
actual 
sitting down and hands on 
critiquing these children 
like uh 
ex girlfriend of mine 
she was 
pretty much 
i wouldn't 
put her borderline illiterate 
but 
she didn't know how to read or write 

very well 
and 
you know her 
vocabulary's limited and 
she didn't know how to 
spell or 
know any 
bigger words 
so i tried to sit her down and 
you know give her a little refresher and 
you know it's 
coming from 
a new jersey public school 
and 
doing a study then 
you know 
couple these different 
places 
you never even hear of 
like 
i don't know cow pow kentucky or 
wherever you want it 
you know some small town would have 
this great 
teaching 
no 
and other towns 
just don't 
not 
really national system it's already 
been put to national 
if they rate them 
state to state 
and city to city 
but 
on 
on the level of the 
actual needs of the student 
you know you can't just put down 
you know 
a book and say i want you to 
put five hundred words on this page why you like this 
or dislike this book 
i mean 
one person can do it 
and another one 
mean you could probably write about 
thousand words 
on a page right now about psychology 
because of your how many years do you have 
two 
three 
yeah 
okay so 
you're 
you're higher up there than 
i would be 
when's your p h d come in 
uh 
all right 
that's about same time my friend got hers 
yeah she went down to western missouri 
yeah just had to leave me here 
we've been best friends for so many years 
oh hell yeah look at you 
you hoosier 
yeah so uh 
things pretty much in columbus public schools you know they don't 
they don't actually sit down with 
you 
they 
automatically assume that once you get to this level you're ready for this level and 
you go on 
well the p s a t's and the 
you know 
just 
all those centralized 
scoring systems they have 
they  
they pretty much told me that 
you know my scores 
when i was in 
what was it 
fifth grade 
yeah fifth grade they said that i was 
i had a high i q 
and 
i could be doctor lawyer ya da ya ya da i don't 
trying to 
raise my hopes up about it but then 
they had this other kid 
who was actually really 
into 
veterinary medicine and 
flying helicopters and all that 
and he really did go on to uh 
study about that 
myself 
cook 
but 
well 
they pretty much put 
by the test scores they don't sit you down like in 
private schools they do this 
they sit you down one to one 
just like we are 
and they spend probably 
you know maybe 
twenty thirty minutes a day 
actually getting to know the student 
what the student still needs for the 
completion of that grade 
and 
once they've figured that 
you're 
able to go there 
then 
up you go 
right up the ladder 
no it's 
it's kind of like um 
you go to a private school and you get there 
maybe seven years old 
on up to 
fifteen sixteen 
and at sixteen they can 
actually determine 
give you 
a test and 
sit down with you and ask you about 
different things 
and 
sixteen 
fifteen sixteen year old could actually graduate from 
college 
you know be 
yeah they've 
they've showed that study already 
i mean i think it's 
i think it's amazing 
yeah 
i mean 
when i first heard about it i said uh some doogie howser shit 
you know 
but now it's just 
you know 
now it's 
kind of reality you know because i know 
pretty much 
a lot of skilled  
skilled trades 
i know how to cook 
pretty much know how to handle myself 
out in the 
wilderness 
mean 
you know go up on nature hikes and 
go fishing 
all that stuff just combines into one 
it's all about being an individual 
and if those teachers can't study with that individual 
know what that individual wants 
young 
then 
older 
kids not gonna know what to do 
end up 
practicing law and not liking it 
going to all that school for it 
fort hayes 
yeah 
well i don't 
i don't think it's really alternative 
it's supposed to be a uh 
let me see 
school for 
art 

now they have different 
art classes and different speech 
and uh 
language classes 
different levels of science and 
it's kind of like a college campus 
it's just like a miniature version of 
ohio state 
yeah you go to 
you go to class in one building 
and you go 
across the yard to another 
then you go to lunch and then you come across another 
and your locker and 
all that stuff it's just like a mini campus 
not really the 
there were too many 
rules there 
well 
you only had to be at your locker at a designated time 
and 
some of the teachers actually had the right to search your bags and 
book bags i mean when it gets to that then 
yeah there's 
there's been teachers there that actually pull students aside if they know they're troublemakers and say well you can't come down here 
you know go to your locker at this time or whatever 
yeah it is 
it's 
it 
yeah it is a  
really 
disciplined school but it's 
lot of rebellion in it the same time 
like there'd be kids 
saying 
yes ma'am yes ma'am yes ma'am 
in class 
and then they're out there 
smoking at the cars or 
cutting school and 
high on their horse yeah 
some of them are too 
hum 
i wasn't there that long 
no 
actually i was uh 
going to get my  
g e d after that 
because they kicked me out for some 
dumb reason 
they confused me with somebody else and 
i ended up taking the blame 
well the charge was cutting class 
yeah 
and 
what it was 
i was supposed to meet my mom outside 
i told my teacher i brought a note and got a excuse 
slip and all that 
i went down to my locker before 
and the teacher we called her the general because she would always be out there watching you 
not a teacher but administrator excuse me 
and she was out there and she saw me at my locker and what are you doing down here and the whole 
thirty minute conversation that could have only lasted five minutes with thank you okay 
here's my slip 
she thought i forged the slip 
and then when i went out there she 
had uh 
security 
remove me off the premises 
that 
following monday 
because i was supposed to go out and sign something for a lease 
didn't really 
happen that way 
i went and signed it and i came back school monday thinking yeah well 
another day another dollar whatever 
get there and they go ahead and 
out 
door 
what 
no it's just uh 
regular old 
rent a cop 
with his own van he'd 
hop in i will give you a ride and 
drove me to the corner 
of the middle of nowhere 
in accordance to  
where i live 
and then 
i had to 
walk all the way 
home 
well i was a little bit on the pissed side yeah i 
i did 
i did my bitching but 
really wasn't nothing to 
do about it 
because 
you know once they have their word in it they're 
better than us i guess 
she didn't 
she didn't say anything 
i mean they wouldn't let her 
i mean we went in there one day and 
you know i explained the whole thing to her and 
and then she puts off some kind of excuse the 
administrator 
she says well 
we don't 
need problem students like yourself blah blah blah i said 
what problem 
i'm going out there like this and a freaking retards i swear 
but 
there is kids out there always cutting 
you know at lunch time 
they'd be cutting their 
next class 
you know there's two different lunch times 
sometimes they'd just 
alternate and take two lunches or go to one class go to one lunch and 
skip after then but 
you man 
they wouldn't cut me slack for nothing 
yeah 
yeah and then uh 
i went to work before that 
yeah i just 
i had to walk from 
hilliard one day 
through 
matter fact through this 
twelfth avenue 
stretch right there 
all the way over to eleventh avenue 
man that was 
that was a hot day too 
uhhum 
i just got done doing some roofing and 
i was supposta meet my girlfriend out there 
she never did show up so i had to walk from 
where incredible universe used to be 
we will just say 
hilliard and two seventy 
all the way back this way 
on campus 
without water 
oh man talk about being stuck in a desert 
yeah that was after i got kicked out and i just decided 
i will go to  
work for couple months 
make something out of it 
i learned a trade 
man 
stressful 
older you get 
more stressful it gets 
mean i remember when i was 
seventeen and i was 
you know out having my good old fun and 
taking care of things 
yeah 
exactly 
so 
you know once you 
once you get to a certain degree of uh 
frustration you need to 
relieve that somehow so that's pretty much why we moved 
because i had a 
lot of frustration built up 
what's next 
got a whole list there 
i don't know 
oh man 
don't let the shirt fool you 
oh man 
i wish i knew what  buy this 
i need a grocery list to find out what we need to buy 
yeah well you get these 
you probably heard on the news these uh fifteen murders or so since nineteen ninety one on the east side 
and then you got 
all these people 
you know i've been in a fights in my neighborhood and 
well my old neighborhood and 
you know fights people breaking in 
stealing your stuff and 
just 
all out 
outlandish behavior 
mean i caught 
i actually rode up on a 
couple people 
down the street from me having sex through a fence 
i'm sorry yes 
i 
thought 
i would expect that from dogs 
i mean yeah a dog can probably get away with that kind of stuff but in broad daylight 
and i was only about fifteen years old 
i'm going like 
what 
the hell is this 
what's going on 
i mean i didn't know who was president then but 
i knew that there was couple people 
it just 
columbus is getting too big for what it is 
mean that's why you have high 
crime rate high population 
population's number one 
and uh 
i'd say pretty soon if they don't 
cage it up a little bit 
you know just 
have 
enough 
residence for the area instead of people being homeless and 
you know 
jobless everything like that 
i mean i hear in new york city where it's 
a lot more 
populated it's uh 
getting real bad 
of course you probably know about that 
well 
muggings on the subway or 
stuff 
you know just in general 
yeah 

yeah it's mainly what happens is uh 
you get 
all the 
out of town 
bad stuff 
yeah i mean just kind of absorbs like 
a sponge 
huh 
well 
i'm not the mayor or anything so i'm not gonna make any promises 
yeah 
i don't think um 
don't think there should be anymore uh 
new developments just yet 
you know just to kind of 
weed out 
a little bit of the population 
put one part of the population in 
this neighborhood and 
you know just 
pretty much divide it all so it's not too uh 
not too crowded one place 
and then 
not to 
vacant 
other places 
yeah 
that's what i'm talking about exactly 
you get people moving in these 
nice big houses out in dublin 
that's fine and all but then 
what about these 
apartments down here on the 
west side 
you know that they don't even do anything with 
mean you have 
so many acres here that's 
you know free space 
pretty much nobody living there and nobody do anything about it 
yeah if they'd uh 
if they'd pretty much straighten up 
all the 
bad neighborhoods 
as they 
well 
they're not bad until 
people make them bad 
you know just 
fix up everything get some 
better lighting 
better security 
better 
police force no doubt 
i mean 
bad enough everybody else talks about them but i don't need to 
everybody else knows 
yeah it's pretty bad when you're uh walking out in the street 
and uh 
some guy tries to take off your 
necklace 
run with it 
and 
you know the cops right there 
and 
yeah it's 
this happened to me 
guy took my necklace 
and started running 
the other way with it 
i grabbed him by back of his shirt just enough 
to stop him 
and i saw 
car coming up 
kind of slow 
so i just 
you know pushed him 
over the top the car 
wasn't even going but 
five miles an hour 
and it happened to be a cop and the cop started asking me questions 
knowing that 
he probably witnessed this whole thing happen 
probably wouldn't have even stopped 
he's sitting there going what are you doing with this guy and why is he on my car and all this stuff i said i want him arrested man he took my necklace 
tried take them all 
radio too and uh 
you know i kind of threw that in there make it sound bad 
i was on my way to work man i didn't want it 
anything bad to happen to me 
or him 
you know so 
all in all the cop 
you know 
put guy in handcuffs put him back 
car he goes 
well do you want to press charges 
and at that time i was 
little bit over my limit with the anger thing i said no just let him out of the car i will beat his ass 
oh man the cop said something that 
i never forget he said i would but that'd probably hafta be 
my job to do if we was living like that 
i was like 
god man rodney king all over again 
no he was white 
just a real 
down 
just 
looked like he was from the  
ghetto 
just 
nasty guy 
well 
i lived in the ghetto so he had to live 
he had to live 
in another 
well 
yeah that's pretty much what i was thinking 
he looked kind of 
you know 
unbathed and sticky and 
real 
real rat looking 
face and 
um 
most likely 
that's about it man 
we had neighbors that did that shit too and 
i really didn't like that man you got people 
right next door 
a woman and her children 
you know 
and she's in there smoking crack you know like god man i got to get away from this before  
something really goes down 
mean hell she might've ripped off her dealer and uh 
dealer comes back shoots place up and 
being right next door 
oops he misses and hits my window 
tough luck bob 
yeah 
no take it from somebody who's been in this city long enough it's not really the 
it's 
it's no georgia 
yeah 
well you go down georgia just about 
everywhere 
except for atlanta 
anywhere else you go savannah you go to 
columbus georgia 
you go to duluth 
any 
of those places 
are fine 
and dandy 
but you go to atlanta 
you see a lot of the  
similarities here 
the only thing is 
atlanta has 
a bus 
and a train system 
metro atlanta rail and 
transit authority 
well 
it's pretty bad when the first day you're in 
georgia 
you go through atlanta and you see 
hookers on 
corner of what would be 
main street here 
you know they call it a boulevard down there 
and um 
you know it's 
when you go down there doesn't really help to see that stuff because it reminds you of 
where you left 
but uh 
the smaller town i went to southeast of georgia 
or uh 
atlanta was really great 
i mean it's just nice 
laid back country setting and 
you don't hafta worry about that much 
crime well your horse might get taken in middle of night but i don't have any 
uh doing another job 
yeah 
plus i had to get away from here again 
i was getting real fed up with 
people i was living around 
i told my mom i'm 
coming down here 
as a vacation slash work 
met a lot of cool people and uh 
survived two tornados 
well the guy that was 
i was working with 
you know he kind of ripped me off and 
he uh 
yeah he owed me about three hundred dollars 
in wages 
for that week 
didn't come across to giving it to me so i accidentally got on the phone with the 
i r s 
in cincinnati 
and told them that he was paying me under the table and got him busted 
well yeah i could have just took him out in the woods and 
whupped him but 
what's that gonna prove 
no i wouldn't have 
i wouldn't have been smiling from down there to up here when he dropped me off 
no not as we was driving it was uh 
i told him i need this money for this thing and 
you know 
you know it was pretty much pay day i want to go out 
get some food 
go out and have a drink 
and 
you know just 
save up some my money so i can get a car 
didn't seem that way to him he 
you know f you and all this stuff he 
flapped off at the gums 
a lot 
and 
i didn't like that so i 
went up there to the pay phone and i 
called 
two places 
called my mom first 
you know tell her i'm on my way up and then 
called 
the i r s in cincinnati 
and told them that he owns a business he's got this and this and this and he paid me and this other guy under the table this much and 
you're technically only allowed to have so many hours 
a day to be doing free jobs 
or tax free jobs 
and uh 
i was agreeing with it until he got on my bad side 
yeah 
uhhum 
ten thousand dollar fine 
oh man talk about cutting a coupon there man 
i mean he would've 
he would've been in the money then because he was just starting his business down there 
and uh 
while i 
while i was down there he had me 
sleeping in a truck 
a moving truck 
and uh 
oh man it was 
it's a hilarious story i mean 
thirty foot moving truck i'm sleeping in it 
and i get uh 

i was just listening to music and i got 
little sidetracked from this uh 
tree across the way got destroyed by lightning 
i looked across and it started raining and 
wind was a little heavy 
rocking me back and forth 
like this 
i got up all the way 
looked around and said what the hell's going on here 
turn on the radio and they said something about 
you know a thunderstorm 
coming through and it will be gone by 
twenty minutes or something 
and 
this 
truck man it felt like it was going to tip over i just 
i got out of there real fast and uh 
started 
walking down towards 
it's about uh 
probably about a good twenty mile walk 
to where the nearest uh twenty four hour 
house of pancakes is 
you ever been down there 
the i hop 
i hop you hop 
and uh 
i got about 
maybe three miles 
down the road and a cop pulls up 
just 
searing rain 
i mean you could 
cut paper with this kind of rain 
just coming down all over the place hail and lightning 
she pulls up she goes are you nuts 
what are you doing and i said 
uh i'm sorry am i walking too far out in the road and 
she goes no 
you're walking in the middle the tornado 
i looked at her said  
shit man so she drove me all the way 
out of 
that county 
to next county where the 
pancake place is 
so she went out of her 
way and out of her jurisdiction 
with this southern hospitality just to 
get me out of the weather 
yeah man i don't want to be 
over in the next county 
you know driving in the middle of the sky 
yeah a couple people down there floating around under me 
that'd be great 
but uh 
what i was most worried about was all the uh 
all the equipment and stuff that was in the truck i mean there's the two thousand pound forklift back there 
and you're not gonna just 
dodge that 
and uh 
the second tornado 
it wasn't as bad i mean as 
we was driving up 
after he uh 
ripped me off and he said well i'm taking your sorry ass back 
to columbus and i said ok go for it 
and just sitting there 
smiling all the way up 
know 
knowing what he didn't know 
we get to tennessee and uh 
you know uh weather's kind of bad there too i'm like 
hey man slow down you know you don't have any windshield wipers in the middle of this rainstorm 
yeah he just used that rain x stuff 
you know it just 
you 
it didn't even matter because 
you look at the wall right there that's pretty much all you seen 
you'd see tail lights as you passed 
people at side of the road we was the only people on the road 
i said man why are they pulled over like that there must be something going on 
he was oh we ain't gonna worry about it right now i'm gonna get back up there 
three o'clock 
in the afternoon 
and i look over and there's this big old white swirling cloud 
comes down it's about two miles west of us 
i'm coming 
just 
out of  
out of my screws here i'm just going 
whoa dude man look there's a tornado over there 
and 
right at that time 
big old pine tree got pushed 
across 
you know it's already been broken but it just got 
nonchalantly pushed across the freeway 
and he goes that's not a tornado that's fog man that's too far away 
i said what 
i said are you kidding me i studied the weather 
and i know about it 
you're gonna tell me that fog pushed that two foot pine tree across the way 
i mean it was a thick tree too 
and uh we get up to the 
next gas station he 
fills up 
and 
i listen on the 
intercom they had 
news on there 
weather and stuff 
tornado warning 
in that county 
i turned around i said now see who's the dumb ass 
here 
i said i bet you don't even know how to spell 
cirrus cloud or 
cumulonimbus or whatever you know 
and uh 
you know he was pretty much pissed off the rest the way up there because uh 
i was right 
and 
that's pretty much the way i felt the whole day because i was just smiling on the inside 
knowing 
oh yeah he's 
mixture between forrest gump and archie bunker 
yeah 
oh yeah 
archie bunker meets fred flint stone 
there you go 
i can't really put him in the 
category of forrest gump because forrest gump was great guy 
fastest sucker on those braces 
yeah i did too man 
it wasn't at the time but 
you live and 
you live and you learn 
yeah 
i was thinking about putting my life on book but 
i don't think they would make that many pages 
have a 
twenty thousand page 
book 
you know 
ten 
yeah ten thousand would be introduction 
well it all started 
yeah i want to take up uh 
couple music courses and 
you know get 
little further on that 
better my education than 
what it already is 
i don't consider myself the dumbest person but 
i know i'm not the smartest 
yeah 
there's uh 
there's a girl at the store i was talking to and uh 
she saw um 
how i wrote my signature if you look right there 
she asked if i was a doctor 
but 
it's just me you know 
i told her i tried to tell her you know 
i'm not in any kind of writing 
special program or 
anything like that 
i'm not a doctor that's for damn sure 
driving a eighty five truck 
you know 
she says something about uh 
you sure you're not a football player or something you know you got that 
that 
that significant signature there going and 
i told her well that's just my 
identification there 
you look on my license nobody can 
copy that you 
see where the 
a u and m is 
my last name 
you probably see it better 
now 
not that photo 
not that one 
but 
yeah it's just 
certain things make person themselves 
yeah the voice the signature the 
fingerprints 
people have their own style of doing things 
i myself like 
watching football 
fishing 
working on stuff 
well there's 
well there's 
plenty of stuff yeah well it's not like uh 
it's not like sex it's little bit safer but 
it's kind of you just 
go out with your equipment 
and 
if you catch one you catch one if you don't then 
you don't 
but 
i've caught plenty of dinners 
lunch breakfast 
all that 
what i like best about it is when you're 
out in the middle of 

nowhere 
you know there's not a store open for miles and 
you're out there and your stomach starts going 
and you're like well  either time to get off my lazy ass and 
you know make this fire useful 
or um 
i'm gonna die out here 
that's 
that's pretty much the 
plan of action you 
take when you're out there it's not 
it's not lets go over to the seven eleven and grab a slurpie and a doughnut or something 
it's more like uh 
you know that 
that squirrels 
looking kind of good right 
yeah 
yeah that's pretty much what we was 
made to do 
you know back in the 
pioneer days you didn't 
have this crap with the kid going 
fix me some canned ravioli or 
and you gave that kid a 
shotgun and he went out there and killed his 
that's an interesting thing i just saw on the  
in the 
news week 
i was reading that 
and 
yeah and there's uh 
certain amount of uh 
gun laws 
that actually didn't 
get into 
until i saw that 
here in 
ohio 
it's 
with a long gun or a hand gun 
you hafta be 
eighteen 
but 
other places like texas 
there's no 
minimum age 
on 
owning a 
you know rifle or a hand gun or 
and you're looking like 
god man you pack 
uh just imagine this little six year old 
walking into the store packing 
oh man 
yeah they're gonna 
most likely raise it up to twenty one 
since all these uh 
the 
kentucky and maryland 
colorado 
all those school shootings and 
can't believe man 
i mean there's articles in there you would not even believe if you haven't read them 
yeah talking about 
all these 
under age kids thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen 
even up to 
eighteen years old uh columbine shooting 
mean 
all those just 
relate 
in one category that 
you know 
it's getting out of control here bill do something 
well 
think a little bit safer idea 
than uh 
eliminating guns 
because you know there's always gonna be weapons out there 
instead of eliminating the problem 
you know 
more centralize it 
make it a national law that you hafta be 
a certain age 
give a certain time period for your 
background checks and 
whatever else kind of record finding they need 
make sure you're 
you know 
not gonna just go out and 
blow somebody's head off for no reason you're keeping it for 
you know just 
either security reasons hunting reasons or practice 
you know 
but 
yeah it's 
the brady bill didn't really do it for 
america like they thought 
i mean yeah you wait five days big deal go out on 
twentieth avenue and 
pick one up in five minutes 
you know 
i've seen all kinds of people carry guns that shouldn't 
well it's not 
it's not how it's 
put into effect 
the law it's how it's enforced 
you know you don't just say well 
you know little johnny stuck his finger in the pie and you can't do that anymore and 
you know the more 
the more security you're gonna have over that pie the more he's gonna want it 
so 
and 
going into the gun thing it's pretty much 
nobody's winning game 
mean you make stricter laws 
you're gonna get 
you know 
even more more people 
you know 
struggling to 
get a gun and 
shoot somebody's head off 
so um 
oh the school thing pretty much says itself metal detectors and 
police at the schools you know it's come down to that nowadays 
and um 
any gun you get from 
criminals 
you know should 
i mean they 
already mailed them at 
buckeye steal but 
there's a little bit more you can 
do with those 
than burn them 
you know 
you could set them up in uh 
some kind of 
top secret lab 
you know 
out in d c somewhere 
the pentagon just 
have 
rooms and rooms stacked full of guns and 
i mean hell in case we hafta 
do hafta go to war you know just keep that little reserve 
keep them out 
public's hands until the right time 
but 
i think that all 
all in all the 
solution would be 
get rid of the criminals 
well 
how you gonna do that 
you don't know somebody's a criminal until they do something for the first time 
yeah and a lot of them's been getting off the hook lately 
see this guy on uh 
hard copy 
he killed this 
woman's husband 
because he was in love with her 
and 
they ended up 
letting him go because he was 
supposedly 
incapable of making his own decisions 
now 
i think that 
there's 
there's uh things in your brain that trigger ideas 
and if you have a 
wide 
you know a wider version 
of 
what they  
i don't know what they call it it's in that 
magazine there 
what triggers the violence and 
violent thoughts 
people actually do think 
more about the violence 
when they commit it than 
the accidental 
you know 
some of it's mindless some of it's not but 
everybody thinks 
yeah it's like the uh 
the woman that used to live in the 
apartment where we lived before us 
see she 
had a husband 
she was married too for quite some time 
he got 
on 
ohio's 
number one d u i list 
with 
eighteen d u i's 
man can you imagine 
how much money 
he's put into that 
i mean you think 
your first d u i offense would be about a thousand dollar fine and 
weekend in jail or something 
but eighteen of them 
and you're racking up all that money and all those legal bills and 
all that time 
i think he is in jail now 
i think he's 
i think he's in prison 
and um 
he has 
no 
drivers license privileges 
for life 
and 
you know it just goes on up the line with his convictions and stuff 
hum 
well that bathroom's starting to sound good right about 

okay 
all right well 
i was born in columbus i am twenty seven 
graduated from ohio state 
uh in psychology 
so i  should i should really realize this parking situation but like i said i usually walk and 
and today i don't really feel like it 
um 
i  i'm having a baby in about two weeks here really ready to get this 
over 
um 
i  
three brothers and sisters 
my parents are divorced and   
i lived with my mom and those the three over there and then my dad's family  i have a brother and a sister over there 
uh which is nice i've got  a lot of support from everybody get 
gets good kind of confusing on holidays 
yeah 
for everybody so it's kind of a really big deal and my parents are the oldest 
from from their families too so it's the first great grandchild and 
and with  
my husband he 
is 
it's 
he's the oldest so for everybody 
it's crazy because everybody wants to buy us 
everything you know and i'm going oh my gosh and they're like just give me a list and somebody is like i wanna get this and i wanna get that so it's just 
it's just been 
something else which is 
which is good though because our families are pretty similar and they're all 
real positive about it but 
basically i i lived here for 
for my whole life and i grew up on campus and 
and um 
and then i 
my family moved to clintonville we kind of lived up there 
a while 
yeah 
yeah i lived on summit street 
so we 
when i was younger we used my dad and i would ride our bikes down here and it was 
just kind of always said i'm gonna go to the university of hawaii but that never  i kind of  
stayed here so 
uhhum 
hmm 
how'd you end up in ohio 
really 
huh 
really 
time to go 
uh huh 
okay 
wow i'm getting i'm 
it's been  i it's been a remarkably well i mean i haven't had 
any problems i found out pretty early which was kind of strange in about 
four weeks 
and i went in  and uh i had a check-up and my doctor he thought i was about seven but they wanted to do an ultrasound 
well the thing is they did this ultrasound they didn't find anything so 
which was really kinda creepy because they didn't know because there's that whole tubule pregnancy thing and all this stuff and 
and the guy that did my ultrasound wasn't my regular doctor and he's kind of 
little 
he's just a little abrupt for me and he says 
well you know if this is what it is you know you could have a lot of serious problems you could  and all this stuff and i said wait a minute 
i'm not ready for this but 
after  
after we figured out that it was just the time period other than that 
it's gone really well i mean  i just 
i and i know we just finished our lamaze classes last night 
and there were some women in there 
they're huge i mean these girls can't even get off the floor and i just feel really 
for me it's it's gone very very well i mean i haven't really had any problems 
well a little bit near the beginning and that was pretty miserable but it's been 
it's been a while 
so it that's not something that 
that  
right now i've had any 
anything like that so 
uhhum 
uhhum 
really 
really 
uhhum 
oh 
really 
right wow 
huh 
yeah i've  i've  plenty of 
it's funny jason's mom asks me 
so is your mom gonna come and stay with 
i said no 
i told my mom she started laughing 
because  
i mean  
of course  for her to come over and help out 
is terrific but if she actually stayed at my house for a week i think we'd just kill 
um about fifteen 
my mom and i don't go to far 
but jason's gonna take the week off and everything so i think that we will 
we will be able to do that 
o s u 
yeah 
well we didn't we didn't find out we had a  
i don't know we figured we'd just wait and be surprised is that what you guys did 
yeah we had a  my mom has a friend that does ultrasounds 
at um 
i think it was mount carmel we went over the weekend 
and we went there saturday morning and i've got this forty five minute ultrasound tape of the baby which is cute because 
you can only see parts of it but you can really  you can see its face you can see what it looks like and everything but i said i don't wanna know the sex 
and it's so hard to 
because we're looking of course we're going through this tape trying to see if we can see anything and you just  you just can't tell i think she was real careful to make sure that 
that we wouldn't be able to she says i know what it is but i said 
um alright well just don't tell us so 
so that was kinda neat then 
we've got girls names 
so we've got either sydney or mackenzie for a girl 
and then 
well thank 
i  yeah i think  think  that we both 
this  think  to collectively together i know jason likes sydney a little bit better 
but um 
i don't know about boys names 
and i just 
well he said one like when i was about three months that we both really liked but that wasn't really names weren't really what we were thinking about then 
neither one of us can remember it 
uhhum 
right 
aw 
uhhuh 
uhhuh 
i figure when the time comes we will just have to figure it 
yeah 
aw that's nice 
oh my goodness 
oh she's a cute 
she really is really cute i mean i mean she's got big eyes and big fluffy cheeks 
she is she's adorable 
how  is she in this picture 
really 
goodness can't get away from her 
oh 
aren't you holding it 
oh the 
hm 
yeah i was  because 
where i was  i was working at a  firm and we were doing we had a lot of business before 
and um 
and   i 
was pretty sick during  during the morning and afternoon part and basically 
you know we talked about it and  just decided to go ahead and just take some time off  i don't know 
i also went back to school then too 
so i figured i'd take that time off and i   going to otterbein 
to get my masters in education 
so we're kinda doing that and then i figure i'm probably gonna 
wait tables at night 
and and finish going to school during the day so 
i got a job  at hyde park 
so that will 
i mean 
it's just amazing because the money's so good you know you really can't beat it i only have to work three or four nights a week and it leaves my whole day free for classes and whatever 
um 
hyde park 
grill 
it's uh 
it's a restaurant it's up in dublin 
so 
i don't know i mean i   did that all through high school and college and after i  actually after i graduated from high school i managed a restaurant for about a year and a half 
so i mean 
it's something  i'm comfortable with 
the hours  
because jason works during the day too so it will probably work out pretty well for us 
just wanna get 
yeah i'm 
figuring 
i'm 
middle of january 
is my guess i will go uh 
school starts i think the fifth of january 
and then i'm gonna go that 
i don't know well i  it's weird because  had a job since i was fourteen 
and this is the first time in my whole life 
that i haven't been working and it's just like 
my mom and i go out to lunch and we go to breakfast 
what'd you do today well 
see i went to breakfast with my mom and then amy and i went to lunch and then we 
you know and 
actually i  
we moved about  three months ago so i've been kinda doing a lot of stuff at our place so that's nice i mean 
had a lot of time to get everything wallpapered and painted  and just do all those kinds of things but 
it's weird you know because i don't have to get up in the morning and i feel guilty you know he leaves at six thirty or seven and i'm going 
bye 
still sleeping which is 
right now is really good because i have a hard time sleeping at night 
and after he leaves 
it's wonderful because i  can sleep in till about ten thirty and i feel a lot better 
yeah 
well i figure right now i might as well take advantage of it 

she has 
no she hasn't worked since 
my sister megan was born and megan is twenty 
so 
she but the thing is i've got another i've got a   sister my sister megan   is my brother he's fifteen and a half and then i have a sister vanessa who's twelve 
so i mean 
it's not like there aren't young kids still there i mean and she does stuff like 
lots of things with school you know she runs all the school candy sales and she does like lots of p t a she was p t a president 
um 
she also likes to remodel houses so if there's a house that comes up she will buy it and fix it up and 
and you know she makes 
you know twenty thousand dollars a year 
on the side doing that she likes to do it and 
she figures well you know that kind of makes up for me not working   
uhhum 
yeah it's true and she likes it she's really good at it and 
drives my  
my stepdad 
because she will always be like 
hey pete can you come over and put these cabinets 
he says i don't wanna do 
but um 
she no she  
she's kinda the  well she does all the painting and wallpapering and like all that kind of stuff but as far as the carpentry work we have 
um 
this one guy that's been doing stuff for our house for a long time or 
she will make 
she will make pete go over and do it 
no 
um 
usually clintonville my mom 
she um 
she doesn't she's not a big fan of driving 
she doesn't really drive very much which is good i've ridden in a car with her one time and 
and 
it just she just would prefer not to and  that's okay with us because she's she's got a drivers license for i d and those types of things but 
for the most part so she kinda stays like clintonville area 
which is  
which is actually a good place for her because a lot of those houses like right around the park of roses 
and those 
of things you can get some that are 
older that need 
need a lot of work but that's a pretty high demand area 
so 
that works out pretty well 
uhhum 
yeah 
yeah so that's pretty much what she likes to do 
yeah 
it is it's nice 
it works out well 
my mom 
yeah she's 
i didn't think she'd have it any other way 
well the thing  mean i know when my mom 
my mom has a friend that adopted 
a baby 
um a biracial baby which  
worked out well he is  just is the sweetest kid in the whole world 
and  
um 
and my mom's friend colin is a teacher and she watched jessie for 
a good three year during the  i mean oh colin paid her obviously 
but 
i mean and she really she really enjoyed that you know something that she could do at home you know she wanted to go out and run errands she could take jessie with her 
you know 
and that was  and that worked out well 
but i think too like with my school schedule you know if i'm just in class 
maybe 
you know three four days a week 
and then the rest the time in the evening jason will be there so it's not like i'm relying on her 
every single day  
all the time to do that and i really wouldn't wanna put my child in daycare 
that would just be too scary for me 
really 
how'd you do this to 
uhhum 
right 
right 
does it 
em 
aw that's nice 
yeah i'm sure 
right 
i think sometimes you there's a tradeoff between 
time and money and you just have to look at it and say which is really more important 
absolutely 
uhhum 
i know that they changed it i know that it used to just be one day i guess because of the healthcare 
something like that   i feel like 
a day and a half certainly would be long enough for me i mean unless there's some type of complications  
i would be 
you know  unless there's something extra that they could do for me there 
and  then i would expect that if there was a problem that they would make sure  that they kept me there but i think a day and a half is perfectly reasonable 
i mean i  
i don't  
i don't know i've never done this 
i can't really say 
but i mean 
my feeling is 
the least 
i have to be in the hospital 
right 
yeah that's true well we  o s u's and they've got a nice facility i mean they have uh 
uh  uh  
like a labor and delivery room it's got like 
it's weird though because when you go they show you they they talk about all this whirlpool bath thing a room with it i don't know if you've heard those commercials or not 
but  
there's only one room that's like that 
and it's 
interesting that they 
advertise that when you go there though 
if you get that room that's what you get 
if not you just get the  
the regular rooms are still nice and they have showers and stuff 
but it's 
interesting because the way they advertise it they make it sound like 
there's this huge place and you're gonna get that no matter  and this and that 
but when you actually go and look around it kind of 
little different 
yeah it's well basically it's like a 
it's about the size of a  very small hotel room and then it's got a separate bathroom with like a big bathtub 
and there's like  they there like oh it's aroma therapy which is a little box on the wall about this big that has like some smelly stuff coming out of it 
but 
i mean there's enough room where people can come and sit down there's like a fold out 
couch bed for whoever's in there with you and then they've got the baby 
they keep the baby right there in the room with you after it's born 
which i think is kinda nice 
so 
i   looks like the facilities are pretty comfortable 
i mean my biggest thing is i just wanna have a room to all myself you know i don't wanna go some place where i'm gonna 
to like deal with 
so i mean it looks 
it looks nice but 
i would be more comfortable at home i think once i go home 
yeah 
well i figure 
there will be plenty of  i told my mom i just want green jello you 
oh 
i don't know it just sounds like it would be something that i would have to have it's just necessary 
oh 
right 
oh 
really 
to the other side 
i'm 
no that's interesting though because i think 
i think   that my whole  i mean i always still  i still feel like i'm  
you know i'm just one of the kids hi mom you know 
you know   i guess it's true and i've always wondered 
you know i turned eighteen and i thought 
well shouldn't i feel like an adult now 
you know i was twenty one shouldn't i start to feel like this responsible twenty five shouldn't i be an adult 
you know and i wonder 
at what point do you really feel like you're 
you are on that other side or you're one of the grown up people instead of one of the little 
and maybe 
maybe that's maybe that's one i mean 
yeah 
well that's fair maybe that's true too i mean i don't feel 
because you know when you're younger you think oh my god twenty seven 
that's so old you must be you know and now that you're here you're like guys i  
i feel fine i don't feel 
little more responsible but other than 
really 
uhhum 
uhhum 
huh 
i have to wait i guess a couple weeks i will be 
uhhum 
uhhum 
right 
well the thing is in lamaze they show you those  i'm sure you guys took those classes 
they're horrible they take seventeen hours of labor they put it into six minutes and you think 
oh my  i'm gonna  you know these women are like i just want to die 
why are you showing me  
i said  didn't want to see that you know i would much rather just 
have my own opinion of what it's gonna be like you know and go by 
what other people said 

my mom never had an epidural jason's mom never had an  
you know and that looks worse to me did you see that 
it takes twenty minutes they thread this thing this needle in your back they put this 
that sounds worse to me than even 
having a baby 
i don't want anything in my back 
i guess it's true you just have to wait and see once you get there 
what happens 
see that's great though 
was it hard 
really 
hmm 
right 
right 
uhhum 
really see we almost think that that would be better but when you put it like that it  certainly 
uhhum 
yeah that's true that's a pretty good analogy 
uhhum 
hm 
something to think about 
oh the  it was the  the  the video tapes that i didn't like 
it wasn't the class that was  the class was kinda goofy 
but um 
it was that and watching the cesareans which i just 
i'm not a 
oh yeah they showed they cut open the they're pulling this baby out of this little hole of this ladies stomach and 
i just 
uh 
i had a heart surgery when i was younger 
and so i've had lots of needles and those types of things and i when it comes to needles  and that kinda stuff 
i'm just kind of squeamish about it 
you know so that stuff i just 
i just don't want to see it 
yeah i mean it's not 
i mean it was a 
really long time ago 
everything's fine 
but i guess 
for me i just 
i don't know it's just it's just a little more a little more than i wanted to see 
but the classes i think were helpful 
but um 
what'd you ask me 
oh 
yeah i think 
i think they will be very helpful  
i was going to o s u for 
um 
to deliver the baby so i decided to take the classes there 
and basically 
my mom had reminded me over and over again sarah you need to schedule  lamaze classes so i called o s u and 
and i scheduled them 
uhhum 
yeah jason and and i and i went together 
and basically they were three weeks long they were about 
four and a half hours 
the first one was 
really long 
you know jason was 
he's i can't take this 
last night wasn't so bad though i mean the first one was a lot of 
lot of 
information classroom kind of stuff but 
he did real well he was much  he's just a  he's just wonderful he was much more interactive  than a lot of the other guys were just kinda 
you know they would sit there and they weren't breathing and they were kinda rolling their eyes and i just think god you bunch of bums you know it's gonna come down to it you know and 
and you're gonna be so awful and he's just 
real supportive and 
and just 
he's just terrific 
does 
it makes it better 
uhhum 
yep 
um 
the parenting stuff they gave us a video to watch at home which was things like 
how to diaper your   
a thing about whether you should leave them 
crying in their in their bassinet or crib which of course 
think is horrible and i think it's good that they've come out with all these new studies that tell people don't do that 
um 
lets see what else was there 
feeding your  i mean it just 
that kind of stuff 
so it was mostly  like 
what we would do is we would talk about 
we'd talk about like  like as far as while you're in labor 
uh breast feeding 
there was a lot of that 
i could tell these poor guys are like uh 
you know they were all kind of uncomfortable 
um 
and then 
like lets see  
a lot of it was  mean 
most of it was 
was  like 
pre  and then there was the breathing that we did at the end but other than the video 
it was mostly like labor related 
they tie it with 
it was all very pro breast  you could tell you could really tell that they had an opinion about this 
um 
we talked about positives and negatives of breast feeding things about 
um  like the immune  some of that stuff i already knew 
they had this thing about 
um 
the nurse said that there have been studies done where babies that have been breast fed have higher i q's 
which 
i 
she said that and i said 
are you   
i was 
right 
and that's the way i felt about it  i'm not saying that that's not a possibility but 
for someone to actually state 
in a class 
if you breast feed your baby they're gonna have a higher i q than if you don't 
i  
uhhum the bonding 
or 
breast feeding 
right and i think that you know i think that it's just because you know  
do so because i know i've done studies and i took some of those classes and you just think about it that way 
and i think a lot of these people just 
you know they  
the nurse says something you take everything for a fact and i thought that was kinda strange but i mean 
i think there's a lot of things that are probably positive enough about it that it 
i would want to do it for 
for a while as long as i could 
but 
i don't know 
really 
really 
really 
huh 
that's different 
uhhum 
hm 
she's okay right 
well sure 
hm 
yeah 
really 
huh 
yeah  we didn't really get 
the the video tape they gave us was half infomercials 
and then 
things like how to clean the umbilical  i mean 
stuff like that but you're   
as far as actual parenting things on it there was really nothing 
even in the package of information 
they gave us 
i think it would probably  i think it would be certainly interesting 

for people to read i think there's enough other resources out there if somebody's interested in getting that kind of information that they can do that 
um 
i know  for me 
just because 
i have so many younger brothers and sisters   
my 
everything i know how 
i've got  some 
what i feel are pretty good opinions about 
how to handle different things and i know that my mom 
always consults me you know like 
my sister 
you know she got her the d in french which vanessa is just 
she's 
this girl is almost creepy she's so bright 
i mean she  is 
thing is one of those things were she just doesn't turn in her stuff 
you know and if 
she's twelve 
it 
you know my mom you know she always 
you know what do you think i should do about this and we always talk about different things 
so i think 
i think it's kinda neat that i've been involved in a lot of 
a lot of the other kids 
that way 
uhhum 
i don't know i think you just kinda deal with it when it gets here though 
but 
you know i think one of the things that you see people do a lot  really bothers me is that whole thing about 
i think you  just have to treat children like they're  
just you have to respect them and you have to not not talk down to them and and that whole thing about 
you know why can't i do this well because i told you so 
you know what 
is that 
even if your answer is 
i don't know why you can't do it it just makes me uncomfortable 
you know that's a  more fair than because i'm the boss of you or something like that and i think if you respect your kids 
and and just kinda set boundaries with them 
you know kinda try to be 
i don't know that's the way 
that's the way my family's always been and it always seems to work really well for us 
no yeah 
aw 
hum 
is it hard to keep up with her 
uhhum 
wow 
right 
look at her  so terrific 
uhhum 
uhhum 
if yup we stay here 
probably 
mmhmm 
i went to private schools for  long time 
hmm 
i don't think that i would have them go to any 
i learned things like 
how to speak french how to set a dinner table how to throw a hot tub party 
that kind of stuff 
was a lot more 
i mean i didn't even i don't think anybody even taught me how to write in cursive other than my parents 
so i mean it was 
it was interesting i mean it was a lot more cultural kind of  
kinds of things you do a lot of 
things with nature and and that kind of  
was 
the seventies too so i mean you 
what we're talking about 
but 
i've  i feel like 
i don't see why  i wouldn't send them to public schools 
i mean   obviously that's a long ways off 
um 
i guess i imagine i would be teaching in 
but  
i don't know i mean maybe 
i don't is that  i don't even know if  is dublin really better 
than 
columbus public or 
i think they've got more money 
i don't know if that necessarily makes them a better school 
um 
i think a lot of it is 
is is really what  
as far  as a parent is what you expect your children to achieve in school and what they want to get out of it 
you know  my family my brothers and sisters they all went to public schools and 
and they took advanced 
a p classes  and they worked real hard and 
and they've got i think that they have options 
that you really  get a lot out of it if that's something you want to do 
and i think as long as you're involved with the school 
makes and just keep an eye on what's going on 
then you're really gonna get out of it what you need to 
uhhum 
really 
uhhum 
yeah 
both 
my whole family all graduated megan was 
first in her class joe's ranked first my brother philips  i uh was 
they're all they're all straight four  
that's 
straight four point o 
kids but 
it's true you know and and they really 
my mom really has  
worked with them to make sure that 
that they get into some programs that they need and they're some things now i think that they're developing that they didn't have before 
some different types of of courses and those types of things so 
uhhum 
yeah 
yeah 
uhhum 
well um 
my family 
he's so funny because my parents are so you would never put them together now you know   back then 
you know my  well you saw my   no you didn't see her  you 
she's cute she's got a little hair cut she's all like 
but um 
she is she's wonderful but   back then they were there was the sixties and they were hippies and 
you know my moms got long jet black hair and they're  
wearing their army outfits and they're 
whatever you know everybody's got bellbottoms and my dads got long hair down to here 
and everything so they lived like seventeenth avenue for a while 
and we lived um 
like i said on summit 
until i was about three years  
and then they split up for a little bit and got back together 
and my mom and i lived some place on campus in just a little one room apartment it was just she and i and i would go see my dad on the weekends 
which  
which was 
which 
great for me i mean  
my dad and i would do fun  my mom and i would do fun stuff and it 
and  
i 
i never remember it being negative 
i  it being 
it's a pretty positive thing for me i was never upset about the fact that they weren't together 
because they all 
both gave me a lot of attention 
but um 
i think i  maybe five or six my mom moved into apartment in german village 
and we stayed there for a while and then 
she met my step  
when i was about 
like six years old i think and then they moved up 
uh to clintonville 
about when i was about eight 
now my dad lives up in clintonville too 
so 
yeah i mean i guess so i mean i always spent the weekends with my dad and i spent the week with them 
so and it was 
it was neat though because pete was my mom was twenty nine and pete was eighteen 
and so pete was just 
who liked to play you know we'd go  fly kites  and do all this fun stuff and 

and the thing that was always cool about my mom is   it was somebody that 
wasn't real nice to  or that i didn't really like 
she wouldn't have anything to do with them i mean the whole thing was you know if i approve of this person 
then then that was always her main focus 
so that was real nice and i was her maid of honor when they got 
but she always she always put me first and i think that that made it 
a lot more positive for me 
uhhum 
oh yeah 
i would say 
so 
oh yeah 
uhhum 
well i had to drive her down here last time so 
she has to come back i might as well go with her 
i'm just kidding we went to get something to eat i dropped her off 
and she took the bus home 
we're talking about 
uhhum 
uhhum 
um 
i think that 
i don't think that divorce is a bad thing 
i think that 
it's 
if you're married 
and  
realize that you get to a point where you and this other person 
are not in a positive relationship for each other or for anybody else in your family 
that it's better to just say 
look this is not 
we both deserve to be happy and we    
and 
go your own 
ways 
um 
i think that 
i think for me personally 
i would certainly 
i would certainly try very hard to be in a situation where i wouldn't 
end up getting divorced 
just because i think it makes things a little bit more difficult as far as like coordinating 
and i know that sounds kinda petty 
but just 
um 
i mean i don't think it's i don't think it's bad but i think that that if you can find a way obviously 
to continue to  a relationship work that you should but my parents are very different 
you know there's things about  
my dad that 
and i wouldn't want to live with 
uh he's great and he's wonderful to me i mean 
my dad is really wonderful to me 
but 
i mean things like 
like when my mom had me  he didn't pick her up from the hospital 
i mean it's that kind of stuff that you think what the hell were you thinking 
you know 
like i said he's great to me and and everything 
but i wouldn't 
i wouldn't want to be married to him 
wouldn't and would i expect my mom to stay with 
with that in that kind of a situation 
no way i would want her to be happy 
and i would want my dad to be happy also 
so ultimately for that situation  think it was much better 
um 
they got married kind of young too you know and i think that 
i think that maybe just jumping into a situation you need to be  a little bit more careful 
i know that 
that now it's a lot different than it used to be 
people would get married and  they'd just be expected to stay together and there's a lot of people that have been married 
for a really long time and they're miserable 
you know  
what's the point of staying married and being miserable i think it's better to get a divorce than 
than to do that 
see 
i don't agree with that at all 
i think if your parents are unhappy together 
only thing that's gonna happen is it's gonna trickle down and you're gonna have to listen to them being miserable 
and i think it's much more positive to have two families 
that are happy than one family that's miserable and they fight and then you feel like it's your you know people say it's a my fault because this happened 
you know 
and i think for me it was easier that they split up when i was younger 
then  
i can't imagine being a teenager 
and having my parents split up i think that that would be 
probably very difficult 
um 
so i don't  that's a totally different perspective  to look at it from from that point of view just because i was a lot younger 
not what i mean 
no i  i don't mean it that way but i just mean 
i think  i think it's better that if people are   get to a point where they can't work it out i mean i think that 
that a lot of times you can do things like counseling and those types of things and 
and maybe there is some way to work it out 
but i mean if you get to the point  you where there isn't then you just have to 
i don't know i think you have to be in the situation in my situation i think for my parents 
it's better that they split up because they're both very happy now 
mm 
uhhum 
uhhum but i don't know if that's 
i think that the divorce rate has gone up because it's more socially acceptable i'm sure there's plenty of people twenty years ago that would have loved to have 
had that been an option 
um 
i think it just  think a lot of it is just depends on the way you handle it 
you know how you 
how you handle it after after the  divorce is final i mean not 
do you see  does that make any sense at all 
yeah 
yeah i mean  
it is    
it's a touch 
i think it's  think it's tough and i think it's really an individual basis 
but i wouldn't 
i would say that there's a lot of 
other things that are 
that would contribute more to   problems than divorce i really don't think that that would be the main 
because 
um 
i think the fact that things like  responsibility maybe a long time ago 
people stayed 
married because they felt like they had a responsibility to take care of  
their family i mean and you can be divorced and still take 
of your family 
instead of 
uh you know  
things as far as people getting pregnant and  then this person goes off  and leaves and you've got a lot of unmarried 
single women that are all by themselves and 
and 
it's just it's more socially acceptable to 
to be able to do these things now then i think it was a long time ago i mean 
peoples' families wouldn't would never stand for something like that they'd say look you need to take care of this you need to deal with this and now it's just 
it's kind of normal and everybody just kinda goes along with it 
hum 
yeah 
see  well if it doesn't if it doesn't work than i can 
well that's what my best friend amy said i will get married and hell if it doesn't work i will just get divorced 
but i mean 
i don't know i mean  guess for me  
i just 
i just think jason and i get along so well 
you know and  and we've been together for about two years and 
i  
i don't know i just  do i just  just really like him i don't 
in ten years from now but it certainly 
there's a lot of things  that our families are very similar i mean we have a lot of the same types of opinions about 
about different things   we communicate very well and i think those are a lot of things you have to look at 
from the beginning i know that i was in a relationship for about five years before i met him 
and um 
his name was jason too but  
he drank a lot 
great guy 
but he sure liked to get drunk 
you know 
and the problem was he would turn into such a jerk 
you know and i just   
i just don't 
i just don't like this is not so is this something  
when i look long term is this something that i wanna deal with for the rest of my life and i said no it just isn't 
you know and i think that you have to look  
and see if you're compatible with somebody 
you know people get into situations and they marry people that you  you've 
from the outside you can look and you can think 
are you nuts 
you know that is never gonna 
so i think that 
you just kinda hafta take into consideration you know are you compatible do you really feel like this is something that's gonna  that's gonna work and be positive 
yeah i don't 
i don't 
i'm not old 
uhhum 
it's a lot bigger 
um 
the things that i notice that are different 
i guess  i mean  you look like 
as far as expansion obviously there's a lot of areas that that are developed now that didn't used to be 
certainly spent most of my time  
in the areas that i grew up i mean i don't 
i don't really go over to the east side very  very often you know sometimes we'd go over you know in highschool and drive and see if we could see a prostitute 
you know or something like that 
but 
um 
i  
i don't know  
as far as 
i don't really keep up with statistics as far as the crime rate and those types of things i mean i don't know 
if it's the media 
you know  
portrays as there's more than there used to be 
um 
i know that when i was younger i was allowed to  to do a lot more things 
uh by myself like to to go places on the bus  and those types of things and 
than my family's allowed to do now 
so i don't know maybe it is a little bit more dangerous 
um but i think that comes with the  with a bigger city when you get more people there's obviously gonna be  some more problems 
um 
and uh i mean that's  that's really all that i know so it's obviously a lot more build up it's gotten a lot more commercial things like city center and 

and a lot more um 
different suburbs so maybe it's 
it's going and  becoming a little wealthier 
and 
i don't think it's  i don't think it's really affected me  i mean obviously there's more places to go shopping or to  or you there's more traffic 
don't particularly care much for 
um 
but   don't think it was ever such a small town where it was like everybody knew each other 
it felt like a small community i mean i know in my own neighborhood 
it was where  you went to school with the people once at least once i went to highschool i went to public school 
um 
and you kinda knew everybody around the neighborhood but i think that that's still 
that's still the same for the neighborhood that my family lives in 
um 
so i don't   me personally other than 
other than the fact that maybe there's a couple more things to do there's bigger more comfortable movie theaters and 
and that kinda stuff  hasn't really 
affected me and i can't say that 
that maybe if  if it would have stayed small  
maybe  could notice some kind of a difference 
but  i never 
i haven't noticed anything 
right 
i can see that i you know uh like i said for me i kind of  
i kinda stay where i am so it's not that i really travel  into some of those other areas 
more 
so i mean  it doesn't really affect me personally 
maybe that's  
feel guilty 
but 
but 
uhhum 
right 
right 
right 
i think there's uh you they're so many small communities like even  o s u is really a 
obviously its own its own little community and then you've got 
you know dublin and they've got their own parades and their own different things so i agree i mean i think that 
that you there really is a lot of things to do in our own individual area that 
i can't see somebody from dublin going over to 
the west side  to do 
you know what  i don't 
and uh maybe also  i feel safer 
where i live too and and that's something that's an issue for me i know when i 
do travel down cleveland avenue it makes me it does it makes me nervous 
so 
i just kinda stay away from that 
um 
i don't wanna get shot 
uhhum 
yeah 
uhhum 
yeah 
well it's  it's kinda hard when you've got 
your  limited choices here you know some of it some of the issues i thought were kind of 
important but when you're looking at the 
mayorial candidates 
did you watch that debate 
oh was 
because you watch it and you think  oh my god 
i don't want either of these people 
i mean  dorothy peters obviously been around for a really long time and i uh 
i would tip i'm 
my views are typically a little bit more democratic but i'm not too say that i certainly wouldn't vote 
um 
for the person that i thought would do the best job 
but when you look at coleman he 
thinks 
there was  
point where they  they asked a yes or no question 
and neither one of these folks 
could  it yes 
or no and they're going 
just answer yes or no they will tell you 
well i think i stated my point very clearly when i was 
no the answer is yes or is it was 
it was um 
healthcare  
living partners 
um 
it's a simple question 
yes or no how do you stand on this issue and it just 
drives me nuts that 
you know and i know that that from a p r stand point you don't wanna 
you don't wanna shun any people away that might vote for you because you feel like the 
damn it 
you know if you're running for office 
you should just 
just be up front 
just say how you feel 
you know because i just think it looks so awful when you can't you can't even admit to what  what you're opinion is 
you know and  it's just 
i think that that happens so often there are too many people or even that whole thing with bill clinton when you're talking circles around yourself 
but you never say anything 
so that's 
that's frustrating for me when you look at both of the candidates and you think 
i don't want either one of these people there should be a none of the above 
you know if there was  that option i'm sure a lot  
uhhum 
really you know i agree i mean none of the above you go and i think a lot more people would certainly go out 
they would vote for none of the above and they we can have some more candidates 
i think that would be perfect 
i think it would 
well i think it's true   don't vote because you think i don't want either one of these people what does it matter 
who cares so you know people just think 
there's no really no point to even vote 
it's too bad 
really is 
hum 
transportation issue 
that was kind of a 
i thought that rail system looked kinda cool you know which is 
which is kinda tough the question is do we wanna spend the money on it 
and will people actually use it 
um 
i think a lot of it goes back down to traffic and you're like you know people driving both ways 
and i think if people are  if they're gonna make it so people are actually gonna  it 
i think i probably a  
pretty good thing to have 
and  i voted for 
i can't believe you're gonna do that 
yeah 
and i 
i just i guess i just felt like 
i don't know it's it's kinda   
i don't i just think that that's kinda neat and if you're looking at traffic and 
and i could see if i was going downtown and coming back 
the amount of money that you pay to park downtown is 
outrageous 
um 
even  just having  takes 
i know when it's when it was snowing because i worked on  worked on front street 
and where i would come  i live on bethel road which is 
i'd take bethel to three fifteen 
down 
through downtown and it would take me an hour and forty five minutes 
in the snow 
to get down there and if i could 
if i could jump on this rail system and it would take me fifteen minutes and i wouldn't have to pay fifty dollars a month for parking 
why not do that 
and all there's also the whole pollution thing and 
and those types of things so i thought that was 
really 
uhhum 
really and people use do people use them 
uhhum 
hum 
uhhuh 
uhhum 
wow 
that's great 
right 
right 
uhhum 
that's great 
to do that 
yeah and i think there's a whole bunch of people that just don't wanna spend any extra money on anything 
we're already paying for enough things you don't wanna do this 
uhhum 
but i don't understand is this  with the construction they start 
everywhere you know you think that you would start one area you put a whole bunch of people and they'd work real fast and they'd get that done 
and then they'd move on 
but it's like 
every single 
city's got like four guys working  you think what the hell you doing over there 
really 
then the people that are doing you think why do you why are we hiring these guys you know what are they what are they 
well they have 
yeah it's projected like six years to take  to finish some of these projects 
own 
real 
well i know we drove through georgia 
you actually see people working on the road there's a whole bunch of people and they're all out there working 
you know and you get to ohio there's that 
i don't know something on david  letterman had a picture of this and i think i've seen it before that big sign that says 
your tax dollars at  you know and there's the construction guy smoking a cigarette leaning up against the sign 
kinda thing 
it was a kinda funny 
well i mean 
no i   i just think that typically you see a lot of  lot of places that are that are under construction not very many people working there 
uhhum 

uh 
which 
which the the as far as the the  
violence 
there well there's the whole thing about the police chief 
and then there's the whole thing about 
um 
about the  the federal lawsuit against columbus 
well just chief  of the thing about chief jackson 
i don't 
he's  i he's 
i'm not real up on this i know that um 
he's done some things and  
i don't know  i  
i don't know if it was drugs or 
something ridiculous 
that 
that a lot of people and i think a lot of the 
the police force and a lot of other officials are 
are pretty much in agreement that he should resign 
and he feels like 
like he's just not going to 
and that we don't have any um 
that the mayor can't 
nobody can actually make him resign that that's something he has to do on his own and that was one of the big things as far as 
you know dorothy was teater was saying i'm gonna make him do this which is something that she doesn't have any power to do 
um 
and about how 
how they just continue to get raises and they're and they're not doing very much about it and 
and less than fifty percent of the police force is actually in police cars and 
and a lot people  are doing desk jobs and those types of things and  i guess a lot of people just aren't very happy with the job he's been doing 
and he just says you know i  i  whether you like me or not i don't care 
i'm gonna keep working 
i don't know but i think it was something it was something real shady that he that he got into and i knew that 
i don't know if it was 
i think it was 
like 
cocaine or  i don't something  i don't 
i don't know i mean something that was pretty shady 
yeah and i don't know if it's quite that 
but it was certainly some things that he's been doing that aren't aren't approved of 
and i'm not real up on that 
so 
isn't that  it's 
that's almost worse though that it's not even a surprise 
oh my god 
right 
uhhum 
uhhum give us a job sure 
is wrong with him 
yeah 
you know i think a lot of times uh you you know people aren't real rational as far as as who they 
they go for 
but i can certainly i can certainly see that 
and that  
i think that you know lot of  a lot of people feel like too oh he's he's he's one us you know he's like he's like we are kind of thing 
well michigan it's a ten year mandatory jail time sentence if you get caught with any cocaine at all 
ten years no question about it that's it 
you're in jail for ten years eighteen years old 
if you've got anything on ten years 
that's it 
you know and you look at some of these other people or like these sports people and 
they get caught with that stuff or have  
and nothing happens and it just sets such a horrible example 
that here you've got you know some regular some 
eighteen year old kid that does something really stupid 
and he's ten years in jail 
and then you've got this other guy that does all these really stupid things and he can be elected well you know and you just 
it's just 
it's so 
it's so wrong 
yeah well 
i don't even know what to  what a disgrace 
embarrassing it really 
yeah 
i did 
i did 
i mean i think he's done some positive things that whole thing about 
um 
as far as like your student loans and being able to get 
which has helped me you know 
and i  you know all this that  as far as some of the issues go 
i think that that i feel pretty similar to the way he does 
um some of his foreign policy things i think have gone pretty decently but i mean i think 
i don't i don't know i mean it 
i don't know if if it really if you really 
it 
i feel like that they're that whole health care thing which nothing ever happened with really 
you know and i think these people have a lot of really great ideas but they don't 
they don't ever really put anything into action they just kind of skate along 
you know and i don't know if there's anything substantial i can say 
and that was a wonderful thing that you did that i feel very affected by it 
um 
economy's fine 
i mean so  it's not that he's 
not that he's doing a horrible job but i don't really know how much he's actually doing 
you know and i think that unfortunately spend a lot of your time trying to get out of 
out of personal 
issues that you've gotten yourself into and you can't really focus on anything that's that's positive that you wanna do for 
for the country and i think 
i think it's just too bad because i feel like 
if i was president uh not that i wanna be president but 
you know you'd have three or four things that you'd think were very important you'd you'd 
hire a lot of other people to take care of the other areas and people that were very competent that you'd feel like they'd actually be able to accomplish some things 
and you'd really work to get some stuff done you know and i don't know if it's 
if it's just because 
you know you have to 
get agreement from all the other all the 
everybody else in government before you can pass anything or or why 
you know why don't these things get taken care of i mean there's so many different issues that people wanna look at and 
end up focusing on things like philip morris you know 
which is like the biggest thing in the whole world you know and and there's so many other things that i think you could be looking at that are 
that are important 
i just 
i don't know maybe i mean i don't 
i don't i'm not real up on everything that's been done but 
i guess it just kind of seems like i wish people would be a little bit more focused and you and you would be able to say 
you know this is what there's these three things that i think are really important that i'm really gonna work to make sure that they get taking care of and 
and i don't 
i just think people kind of la-dee-da it and say well this is 
it's like this you know well we will see what we can kind of do about it and then we will 
you know 
right 
yeah i mean but i mean 
we're not at a depression and 
and the you know the employment rate is fine and 
healthcare is we've got some improvements there and like i said that 
that student loan 
you know uh but i just 
i mean so i wouldn't say he's done a a a horrible horrible job 
but i mean i think that you just spend so much time focusing on other things and look at all the money that we've wasted 
but we could have spent that  
money on something else you know and you end up 
doing that 
yeah i usually don't 
not quite there 
not really 
yeah 
yeah 
i 
i don't i don't 
really 
yeah 
i haven't i i really haven't even haven't even given it that much thought yet 
once they start running those 
then i will kind of kind of read up on it but i haven't 
not really 
okay 
that's fine 
i think  i'm 
i'm perfectly content 

what kind 
mm hmm 
i've been here all my life 
um 
i uh 
right now i don't mm do anything 
uh 
i had a 
head injury in ninety three 
where i got hit with a hockey puck in the 
head 
at a chill hockey game 
and uh 
that's when i lost my job after that and things got difficult 
more and more difficult 
um 
was unable to work full time 
i'm doing some part time work right now 
working with people with mental illness 
um 
but  you know the 
the thing i'm running into out there is that uh 
nobody wants to pay you to do anything 
uh i don't understand that but uh 
and then the when they do want you to do something they abuse the hell out of you 
you know they give you a pager a cell phone and they want to know where you are morning noon and night seven days a week and that's none of their business 
um 
so i 
the frustrations with trying to find an adequate job and an adequate employer that understands my situation and 
and how i operate and will give me freedom to do 
what i can do 
i have a bachelor of arts in communications but it's been more of a 
problem than it's been a 
asset 
um 
interviewing for jobs 
people that uh were doing the interviewing 
had just a high school education 
and uh 
they're not gonna hire me 
when 
after a year i'd be their boss 
um so a lot of that is out there 
uh regardless of what people say i'm not trying to be pessimistic or negative 
it's just been my experience 
uh unfortunately 
um 
i hope it gets better 
but uh 
like i said i haven't been 
ever 
uh told that my degree 
matters 
by any employer 
uh contrary to what the news tells you and 
what people will tell you oh go get that college degree 
uh 
you know uh 
people told me 
soon as i got out of college then i needed a masters 
and then 
they said and after you get your masters you will 
definitely need your doctorate 
well you know the people saying this are 
college people 
the college is a business 
uh 
and it takes awhile to 
if you can get in and get that education on grant money and scholarships that's 
that's good but then 
even now 
being a person with a somewhat disability from a brain injury 
um i mean i don't even like to call it disability and 
i have 
uh different abilities now 
you know same abilities i used to do 
but i have to do them a different way 
um just because my brain functions on a different level and i can't explain that 
to anybody and i shouldn't have to but i'm always forced to 
um 
but uh trying to find a job you know 
uh 
resulting 
from this has been difficult and uh 
and that's uh you know i'm not giving up hope or nothing like that i'm just trying to 
trying to cut through and see what i can do 
and uh 
you know there's just ah 
um 
um it's very limited out there 
you know  and your 
is 
is an asset but like i said even as a person uh 
now going through b v r 
um i'm discriminated against in my opinion because i have a bachelors 
in other words 
uh bureau of vocational rehabilitation 
which is government funded 
organization geared toward helping people with disabilities get back to work 
and um 
because i already have a bachelors they won't pay for school 
now if i were stupid 
you know if i just had a basic 
just got out of grade school 
and didn't even have my g e d 
boy they'd pay for my high school my college and everything 
you know even living expenses 
you know 
but 
because i have a bachelors 
nothing 
you know 
her limited very limited 
so i mean it's that's what i'm saying the 
uh i think it's 
even american disabilities act talks about certain things about employers 
um and and with my lawsuit 
you know with the uh 
the chill 
and you know with all the 
public trials of high profile trials i think it's  education for everyone to know that the legal system sucks and does not work 
um is not fair 
it's a rich man's person or a rich person's system 
judges are bought and paid for 
they're elected 
um 
there's a lot of crap there and  learned all this not from 
just my experience but from people that i know that are attorneys 
that there are judges down there 
that take bribes 
and that's 
that's not right so you can't 
when you're dealing with that system 
justice comes at a price 
and you get as much justice as you can afford 
and during my lawsuit that was 
very evident 
you know laws are made to protect 
people that are wealthy 
and that commit crimes 
and it's not right it's not fair but that's the way it is 
so um 
i didn't wanna go into law 
didn't wanna go into paralegal i was looking into that and 
lady kept hounding me and telling me you know well 
maybe you could get in it to make a difference i'm like why would i wanna make a difference if it kills me 
you know because i know myself 
and i don't put up with crap 
you know i see a liar i bring him out 
you know 
and uh 
i was just brought up to be an honest person 
and um 
unfortunately there's a lot of people out there that 
you know they sell out their ideals and their principles 
for forty thousand dollars a year 
and then they use their family or 
their situation financially excuse to sell those ideals out 
i'm not that kind of person 
and i won't ever be 
um 
so if that means that i stay 
monetarily poor for the rest of my life then so be it 
you know i got a conscience 
and uh 
and people that are honest and have a conscience are dangerous out there 
you know that's basically where i've been 
you know 
um i've lived here my whole life like i said i went to college i played baseball 
um 
due to injuries you know knees and shoulder i 
just 
i was very 
i was pro caliber 
you know uh 
i played baseball with the 
with paul o'neil and kent murker which are a couple of guys that 
you know did get signed 
and are playing right now 
um 
so at least i can say i played 
against them 
and uh 
least with kent murker i can say i 
hit a home run 
off of him 
so 
that was a while ago but 
that was when he was young and very good 
i was three or four years older and still took him deep to center field so 
i will never forget that but uh 
i earned that 
so that's um 
well um 
well that uh you know i i don't refer to it as an accident anymore 
you know they're 
um 
my whole life it changed ah 
in every 
facet 
um 
from it 
um 
you know physically emotionally mentally and spiritually 
um used to be catholic i don't follow that way anymore 
and um 
yeah i follow more uh 
ah 
natural way 
of following god 
nothing uh 
new age i don't wanna say exactly what you know just say that the people this land 
long time ago before anybody came over here with their bibles and crap 
um 
ramming jesus down people's throat the people of this land had a way of worshipping god and that's the way i wanna 
that's the way i follow 
um 
so a lot of people say that's native 
or say that's indian or whatever you know i don't care what they wanna put on it but it's 
it's that's a natural way of following god it's the way i put it you know 
worshipping that there and respecting the spirit that moves through all things 
all living things 
and uh 
so i went through all that all those changes and uh are still 
you know coping with them and trying to find ways to cope with them to 

um 
to move forward in my life now what happened with the chill was you know there was 
uh 
i had a friend that worked for them so they didn't know that and um 
uh he told me that there was glass in the back 
room that they were supposed to install were supposed to have installed that was five feet higher 
three to five feet higher 
and um 
should have would have could have you know if it was up i wouldn't have got hit 
i mean there's no two ways about it 
but 
if i didn't get hit i wouldn't be where i am 
now 
spiritually so 
i don't refute it as an accident 
and most of the spiritual leaders and people i talked to 
ah went through the catholic church because that was where i was raised and what i was raised and none of those people could provide me with any adequate things 
terms of counseling i know they tried 
i know they did the best that they could 
but um 
there's a lot of things that the catholic church won't like to admit that they're wrong on 
and they are wrong 
um 
uh 
they will sit there and ask me to atone for my sins yet they won't atone for the sins of all the priests that are molesting children still to this day 
and they protect them 
and that's not right 
and i'm very 
very 
uh 
outspoken about that 
so rather than banging my head on the wall to people who wouldn't listen i just decided to leave the church 
i don't go there anymore the only time i've gone there was for 
my nephew's baptism and my grandparents' funeral 
and that's the only time you will find me in there 
you know 
i went to a wedding 
too but it's difficult sitting in there 
because of the way i follow now and uh 
and actually seeing things for what they are 
and it's frustrating not being able to explain that to people but that's okay 
um 
with the lawsuit ah we had a private investigator that went in there and found all the information that showed that they 
had all that higher 
taller glass back there over a year 
so they tried to use the excuse their excuse was that they couldn't find the hardware 
to install it 
and uh given all the hardware stores that we have here and 
the ability to over night freight things uh 
if it was any kind of ah 
special hardware that needed to be ordered from out of state or out of the country 
there's no excuse 
so basically 
you know it came down to after 
it came to a legal battle 
which was ah i was not gonna back down 
they were um 
i was poor monetarily and they knew that 
so they were using the legal system to wear me down 
um 
the first uh at the date of filing i mean 
first of all it took 
i had a statute of limitations was two years 
uh i had an attorney in a law firm representing but they were dragging their feet 
i felt they were dragging their feet because they were in bed with the chill 
you know 
and that they were getting paid under the table to drag their feet 
even though i knew the guy so i just said well look i'm dissatisfied i'm gonna go find another attorney 
so give me my file 
see you 
and i went shopping around for a new attorney 
and it took me about 
seven 
before 
pardon me 
seven attorneys before i found one that was 
adequate in terms of 
knowledge of head injury and brain injury because his father was a neurosurgeon and uh 
he had experience and expertise in uh 
bringing up 
the uh 
the differences uh 
and the realities of of a brain injury 
ah and the effects the lifelong effects you know 
so after 
the two years we got in uh 
just under the two years 
so i mean 
hell that would be what it happened in ninety three so 
just under 
december ninety five 
uh 
the day the last day 
of ah 
the statute running out we filed 
so we got it filed 
once it was filed the judge ah scheduled a hearing 
and for whatever stupid reason 
um 
the soonest they could hear the case was one year from the date that we filed 
so 
you can see when you get  bed with you know 
and involved in the legal system in terms of filing a multimillion dollar lawsuit 
or whatever 
you know any kind of lawsuit uh 
the big boys get all the breaks 
so 
ah in my opinion the judge didn't wanna hear the case before then or maybe his docket was full but i'm saying 
you know there's no prioritization in the legal system 
there are some things that uh should be addressed 
soon 
uh i shouldn't have to wait that long but 
so then 
came down to one week prior to the uh 
hearing 
and i got a letter from my attorney and he said that uh and also a phone call from the office saying that uh 
um 
that they uh 
were filing a continuance 
which meant that uh 
the judge granted them an additional year 
of discovery 
um 
whatever the law says 
you know 
the judge says he has to back it up 
but 
so that postponed the trial for another year 
which pissed me off 
you know 
but that's exactly what they were planning on 
you know 
wearing me 
like i said 
knowing that i don't have the money to 
throw in there and say hey 
you know 
um 
but  know full well that we had all the evidence that we had too 
so 
ah 
that just postponed it for another year finally we got into uh 
coming in and then they ah sent a letter saying they wanted to 
meet 
uh for arbitration 
to see if they 
we could hammer out some kind of settlement 
couple months before the trial 
uh i was unaware of this common practice but you know 
it was very 
iffy situation 
um juries here 
uh in columbus have been mm 
ultra conservative 
uh they feel that people for some reason or another 
that people that have been legitimately injured and their lives have been affected that they don't deserve money 
for whatever reason 
um 
and it 
don't think it's fair 
that they can sit back and be that conservative if it hasn't happened to them 
i don't think that's fair 
um 
because it does affect your entire  
has 
otherwise i'd be full time employed 
i'd be gainfully employed making money and i'm not 
and that's 
that's not because of anything 
uh 
it's by choices on my part but it's 
it's uh 
you know there's a lot that 
there's a lot there 
the betrayal that i've had to struggle with there's a lot there that 
um 
you know i felt i've been betrayed 
by everybody that taught me 
i feel betrayed by the the government 
by the legal system 
by the politicians by all the people that have been put in charge 
to protect people 
to protect ideals 
to protect principles 
throw it out the window for money 
and then when it comes down to me being legitimately hurt 
um 
it got down to just 
ah dollars and cents 
bartering 
for what my life was worth 
and it's 
the bidding started at a hundred twenty five thousand dollars 
i feel i'm worth more than that 
you know 
i feel like you can't put a value on a human life 
um 
you know there were just subtle things that you know my 
sense of  
taste and smell was gone for about a year and a half 
ah 
just all the trauma that goes involved with it not just 
not just the physical trauma i mean that was enough to kill anybody but because of me because of my size because of my strength 
uh i wasn't killed 
you know 
um 
so the physical 
burden i was still dealing with a lot of the physical pain 
uh it's gotten significantly less 
but 
uh the emotional pain 
was worse 
and is worse 
um having to 
have a 
you know a lack of money now 
means lack of socializing means lack of going and doing things 
um 
you know 
don't have any 
lot of relationships don't have 
a girlfriend don't have a wife don't nothing like that i've got a dog 
a golden retriever 

he was being real helpful 
you know 
with the 
uh 
being a support 
you know my parents are very supportive but 
you know it was just sickening that I when I sat down there and they 
just you know the bidding started at a hundred and twenty five thousand dollars and 
actually they offered us twelve thousand dollars my 
attorney looked at him and said are you fucking nuts 
he said this guy had his head split open and 
it was your negligence 
so 
you know 
we will we will take that as an insult 
and don't insult us any more or we will go to trial 
um 
so my attorney jumped it back up to a hundred and twenty five thousand dollar 
I couldn't take sitting there 
these guys going back and forth and what they thought I was worth 
even the arbitrator was an asshole 
um 
but uh 
that's the way that system works 
that's all they understand is money 
the lawyers the judges everybody 
that works in that system 
I don't care who they are there isn't an honest one in it 
I don't care 
there isn't an honest one in it they might think they are 
but once you 
expose yourself to corruption 
you take that in with you 
and sooner or later 
you know all the people that have gotten into political offices and public service 
I guarantee you they went in it with 
the ideal of wanting to help and make a difference 
but 
but 
once they get in there 
it's such a bureaucracy 
it's so corrupt 
they have two choices 
to stay in it and try 
or to succumb to all the things 
and 
ninety percent of them as you can see what happens in washington 
have succumbed 
you know 
there's a 
I don't I don't hear any of them 
raising hell about what really matters in this country 
you know they all get uh side lined and side tracked by special private interests and that's 
that's the bottom line 
and it's sad but there's 
so  I choose not to involve myself in that 
as 
much as possible we ended up settling for 
you know bout seventy thousand dollars and uh 
um 
it was just a hard decision to make you know because I felt you know 
a lot more shoulda come from that 
I mean in  
joking around you know I saw that Adam Sandler movie Big Daddy he 
got his foot run over by a cab and there was a line in there 
pardon me where he says uh 
well I got my foot run over by a cab and that cab was huge and the jury decided that one night of pain in the hospital was worth two hundred thousand dollars 
and I'm like you know what hospital was that you know where 
what  you know 
uh 
so a lot of the things you hear in movies and television about these multi million dollar lawsuits  
is a lie 
um 
even the lady that 
I mean 
sued  
mcdonald's for 
spilling the coffee on herself because she put  in her crotch with the lid off you know uh 
uh there ought to be a common sense clause in law suits you know  her own stupidity 
uh and  you get the attorneys trying to argue that well mcdonalds 
coffee is hotter than every other 
coffee 
it's like 
big deal 
you know common sense it's hot you don't put it in a sensitive area while you're driving to work 
um 
but she sued for ten million and the papers said she won ten million 
she didn't 
I mean after that ten million award was given by a jury 
then the uh mcdonald's is allowed a 
an appeal 
at the end of a year so she doesn't see any money for a year 
and that's if they don't appeal 
but ninety percent of these big corporations have the money behind them they have the lawyers behind them 
so they can sue for an appeal 
uh poor people can't do that 
um 
after all is said and done with her case she was left with about a million dollars 
and then out of that million the attorney in the firm got a third 
plus she had to pay off his expenses so 
really she was probably left with only about three hundred thousand dollars 
which if used wisely okay maybe she could have 
but it sounded to me like she didn't have a money problem anyway 
she was a corporate person 
um but a very stupid person 
um 
so I mean that's basically my my 
battle with the legal system I 
you know I've  I've got a person right now that owes me five hundred dollars that I wanted to take to small claims court 
I even got the  uh the cancelled check to prove it and  but 
you know uh 
and when I look at what the alternative is which is subjecting myself to 
uh 
unfairness 
uh 
even though I feel I got a concrete no way 
you know 
uh those are the ones that I mean I'd have to pay an attorney and the cheapest one I can find right now is a hundred forty five dollars an hour 
and  nobody's worth that 
you know 
so that's what I'm saying it's so retarded 
uh over  I don't mean to 
use that word in a bad way but it's ridiculous 
that's better word 
uh that 
that people have to uh 
uh 
have to throw out a case that they may have a legitimate case because they can't afford the legal help 
so I think that's wrong 
in this country 
the land of the free and the home of the brave yeah right you know 
it's land of the free all right yeah it's free country but it will cost you 
I don't know 
uh 
this freedom 
semi quasi freedom 
there's an illusion of freedom and a reality of freedom 
uh 
and the indian people know the big difference of that 
you know 
so 
but  you know 
I ended up settling the attorney got most the money 
what little I had I invested  and then I made some bad investments when I went off 
my medication 
and uh 
you know 
blew it 
you know so that was my responsibility my fault but uh 
you know how it was just  years of 
pent up frustration and I just 
I spent it 
I spent it in a 
you know unorthodox way but 
you know well I had fun doing it 
uh 
won't lie there 
uh 
lot of happy strippers in town 
so 
or I should say exotic dancers 
well something that  I I wanted to get into some kind of counseling 
with people that had been through traumatic experiences 
but I need to be at a point where 
you know 
I'm 
in my recovery 
where I know 
I won't be sucked back down into their 
way of thinking 
um 
so it's it's a step by step process I 
I tried to go into counseling for chemical addictions you know for alcohol and drugs 
but 
um the bullshit excuses I keep hearing from these addicts was just too much to take 
and even 
even the bullshit excuses from former addicts 
it was like uh give them a license to be a screw up 
you know 
uh a lot of the nurses even who were former addicts you know when it came down to doing procedure and doing business the way it should be done 
they weren't doing following protocol 
and of course me I'd be the one saying hey you're not following protocol 
and they'd say well you know I'm a I'm a former addict I'm allowed to do that 
I said  no you're not 
you know 
yes and  and that's so I'm 
I'm geared towards you know with people with mental illness you know they've they've diagnosed me with bipolar but 
you know my neurologist says the bipolar was a just a chemical imbalance as a result of 
the brain 
injury 
um 
and spiritual leaders told me that uh it's a spiritual imbalance 
there's there's 
really no uh chemical thing there 
there's  the problem is a  physical mental and spiritual with the majority of the problem is spiritual 
and when you talk to people that 
uh know that 
not believe it they know it 
I mean 
you talk to people in the catholic church about the unseen 
meaning the spiritual realm 
and they freak out 
yet they pray a prayer every sunday we believe in the seen and the unseen 
I will never forget it 
because I recited it for god knows how many years 
but when you talk to them about possession when you talk to them about demons or spirits 
they freak out 
or they use the bible to say well you know god specifically says in this chapter not to partake in spiritual activity 
well who do you think wrote that 
you know 
who do you think wants to keep you from 
from doing something that will help you because 
people this land and 
indigenous tribes all over the world they don't follow the bible 
they've done pretty damn good 
you know and 
um 
it's just the   spiritual aspect there is the realm even einstein the most 
brilliant man supposedly mathematically of our time 
ah even said that there will be people or should be people come along with better theories than he has yet but nobody has taken the time or made the time 
to challenge his theory 
you know 
he says that e equals m c squared I say it's e equals m c cubed because  the world is three dimensional 
it's not two dimensional 
uh two dimensional limits 
everything but you look at his theory of relativity 
all of our mathematical theorems 
physical theorems on physics and things of that nature 
have been based off that 
and they're not accurate 
because i've  
things that are not 
physically possible 
they're supposed to be not physically possible 
goes against the first law of physics 
but i saw it happen 
i experienced it 
well 
ah 
um 
and some of our ceremonies  uh 
this is confidential right 
no one else is gonna see this 
because i don't wanna 
um 
i don't wanna have any of this printed or anything 
you know it uh 
okay 
all right 
well in 
in the ambiguous part of it you know just saying try to be 
protective of 
the ways 
of the people of this land that 
there's in a  a ceremony called an eneepee which is a sweat lodge 
and a lot of people will talk about sweat lodge um 
it involves heating up stones 
in a fire 
and  
putting the stones   
lodge 
and pouring water over them and closing the door and singing songs 
it's not a sauna 
it's 
not a uh steam room 
uh 
it's a very spiritual 
experience 
yes it gets hot in there 
how hot 
who knows 
but 
it's been such a strengthening 
spiritually strengthening 
thing 
it also 
physically purifies you by so much sweat that pours out of your body because of that heat 
um 
it gets all the crap out of you 
you know 
it clears you purifies you that's what it was for 
that's what the people used it for purification 
and even 
it's made up of four rounds usually sometimes three 
and the last round is usually called the purification round 
where whoever's pouring the sweat the spiritual leader that's pouring the sweat 
he will make it tough on you 
he will pour all the water that's left in that bucket 
and he will do it in a way 
it just brings that heat out that steam that breath that sacred breath is what we call it 
god 
um 
and breathing that 
it's like when we were in the womb of her mother 
we were breathing water 
we were breathing 
fluid 
um 
oxygen is in that fluid too 
it's in that mist that goes over the 
the fields 
god's in that 
you know 
um 
even when a cow takes a crap in the middle of the field and that steam comes off it in the winter time 
god's in that steam 
a lot of people can't understand that 
um 
so  the the laws of thermodynamics say that it's impossible for rocks to retain heat that way and that they can't be heated to an adequate point of 
of withholding heat 
or sustaining heat 
when heated by a fire 
that 
you would need 
like in the old days you know to melt metal 
they used uh air 
pumping it through 
like the blacksmiths or whatever you know 
melt and 
soften the metal so they could work with it 
yes the air would help increase the temperature 
but 
a fire kept for a long period of time 
will be hotter than any kind of fire you've ever touched 
or been around 
and that fire is sacred it's a sacred fire 
uh 
so that's why it's possible 
but 
if it 
if i went down there with the laws of physics 
told me that those rocks 
couldn't sustain heat 
yet i see when the fire keeper breaks them out of the 
out of the fire pit and brings them into the sweat lodge that they're red orange glowing 
you gonna tell me they're not hot 
so that's that's one example 
um 
yes 
i've done it 
for the last uh 
bout five years 
uh 
how many i don't know it doesn't matter 
um 
been in  
many ones that were 
too hard for me 
and i had to get out 
uh 
and other ones  it's a it's a struggle 
with that thing and understanding it 
takes time to understand it 
lot of people lot of good people are helping me 
to try and understand it 
um 
i was trying to let the fear of that 
um 
though i'm not afraid to die 
i'm afraid sometimes that i will die before i get a chance to do 
what i feel i was sent here to do 
which is just the basic things 
fall in love with somebody have children raise them 
and move on 
um 
that's that's basically my fear 
but 
uh as one of the guys tried to help me he said well listen i'm afraid of that too and he said because right there in that pit there that's god 
now if you remember that 
there's nothing in here that can hurt you 
even as hot as it gets 
you know 
and when you think about that 
you try not to think too much while you're in there 
although it's hard to do especially if you're thinking about how hot it is 
but if you're listening to people praying 
and they're praying with their heart and i tell you 
because of how hot it gets in there 
you will hear people pray straight from their heart 
not a bunch of real fancy words 
in a real comfortable setting you know 
that 
that heat 
will that sacred heat will 
bring 
what's in your heart out 
and sometimes you will say stuff that doesn't even make sense 
but 
you say it 
and it brings it out 
and that's what it's for 
so i mean it's uh 
it's a struggle understanding that and uh 
i i made it through all four rounds this time 
and uh i even sat up which was the first time 
um 
it's a struggle 
but it's a 
it's necessary for the way i follow 
if i didn't especially for men women have a purification every month 
with their cycle 
uh that's 
the way the indian people believe that many of the woman refer to it as they're on their moon 
because when the moon's out the moon is that sacred 
and there's that 
that life 
women have that 
uh gift of life that they can give 
uh men can't do that 
um 
there's just a lot there 
that uh 
you know women go through that purification every month so women really don't need the sweat lodge 
but it's there for them 
and they do participate 
um 
i've been some places where some men refuse to sweat with women 
sometimes i 
felt 
kinda weird about it 
just because uh 
um 
women have a medicine 
you know 
and probably because that was lacking in my life 
um 
i couldn't focus on what i needed to focus on when i heard a woman's voice in there 
but then some of the elders sat me down and and the other thing about the sweat lodge is men go in there in shorts 
women go in there in a long cotton dress 
you will hear people say you go in there naked 
uh that's not true 
i mean uh 
some of the older men in older tribes and different tribes 
um 
they will be naked but they will still go in with a huge towel on 
you know 
so it's not a 
there was a man named sun bear 
who was uh 
recruiting women 
you know 
and telling them they had to sweat naked 
you know 
so he could get a look at them 
which is very disrespectful but 
you know 
there's some psychos out there man i mean there's some psycho around here in town called rainbow eagle 
gave himself that name 
didn't earn it the indian way 
didn't have it done through ceremony nothing like that 
and even the man that he followed for a while sitting in a rest home over in south dakota now 
because he's old 
he's on his way out 
and he was a road man gave his life you know for eighty nine tribes 
to help them find and refine their connection with their spirituality that they'd lost 
um because of the missionaries 
bringing christianity 
i mean 
um 
i've got nothing against christianity 
but i got something against the way it was brought here 
and that's what i'm saying atoning for sins 
it's quite a hypocrisy when you got a 
church telling you that you need to ask for forgiveness when 
what they did i mean in the church in zanesville where i went and buried my grandparents 
and went to all my life 
over the door of the church was a picture of christopher columbus with 
a missionary 
a priest 
and all his men with his sword drawn 
a dead native american at his feet and three more at the side looking on in fear 
now 
i asked the priest 
cold hard question 

is that 
the way jesus christ would have brought that here 
well some people have their opinion and i said no 
no 
i say you you wear that collar 
you do something about that 
if you don't 
then i realize what a spineless person you are 
but you will never find me in your church again 
so 
i've done what i've done but 
there's a lot of people out there that will read a book on native american spirituality 
and they will become self proclaimed spiritual leaders 
uh they will learn the sweats there's some people that have taken pictures of sweat lodges which you're not supposed to do 
uh they show step by step how to build one 
and tell  
that some kind of wood to build it out of  ninety percent of the time they tell you the wrong kind of wood 
um there's a way to do it 
and there's a way to do it uh 
it has to be done that way traditionally there was a reason for that 
um 
because the people of this land were given specific instructions 
from their creator through visions 
through a woman called the  white buffalo calf woman that came to the people and brought them 
these ceremonies like the sweat lodge 
they brought them the sacred pipe 
it's not a 
it's not a belief thing 
it's a way of life 
and it's a way of life that's still in danger of being snuffed out 
but it won't be 
it's just 
it won't be 
it's just we gotta be careful about 
uh how and what you do and if you look  native american spirituality or religion for lack of a better word 
ah because our people believe that religion you can't uh 
you can't encompass one word  that is in the one word 
all of creation 
into religion 
all of what spirituality is into one word religion  you can't 
um 
but when you say it's a  of spiritual nature 
that's 
you know that's still leaving the door wide open that it's it's broad it's bigger than you or me 
ah 
but that ah 
that whole thing is um 
you know the people of the land had a  a specific instructions 
on how to do things 
and i i'm not saying they were perfect either 
there were a lot of indian people and there are a lot of indian people out there that are crooked as a dog's hind leg 
that's just the way it is 
they're corrupt the money has corrupt them the lack of money has corrupted them power has corrupted them 
um they wanna be a spiritual leader why i don't know 
um 
to me it's an ego thing 
and uh this rainbow eagle guy had some kind of buffalo uh 
um 
what do you call it a  ceremony 
but he charged everybody 
native people don't do that 
i mean 
traditional native people  
you don't charge people that wanna come learn about god 
there's some people in california 
that say certain ceremonies were a native 
thing and they buried a woman in the ground with a straw 
told her it was some ritual of proving and over coming fear 
yet the lady was an asthmatic and she was claustrophobic and lost the straw 
in her mouth and she couldn't breath and breathed in all the sand and died 
and so the first thing they put in the paper is that another native ceremony shows us how 
native american spirituality should be 
outlawed 
and if you look at any kind of 
uh spirituality religion that's out there native americans are only ones that have legislation actually saying what you can and can't have 
that there's blood quantums 
saying that if you have a fourth 
or a half 
and even 
if you had two full bloods 
from two different tribes 
and they had a child 
the federal government still considers them a half blood 
why i don't know 
doesn't make sense 
but the federal government and their lawyers have done that 
and the department of the interior 
still considers native americans 
on the same level as a dog 
they don't have 
something wrong there 
and that still goes on today after about six hundred years 
and we got good people in this country that wanna do something about it 
but unfortunately 
what i'm finding 
you got everybody's gotta choose their path 
there's the ones that will get out there with their picket signs 
and raise hell 
okay 
me i don't wanna go to 
jail and get arrested because i feel i won't do my people 
any service by being in jail 
but there are those that are out there that are 
willing to do that 
warriors that are out there men and women that will do that 
uh more power to them 
uh 
all i can do is pray about it 
and that's what i suggest to everybody else 
that's the most powerful thing that you can do 
even one of the  
in high school 
that taught me had a poster on the wall that said 
things are wrought in this world by prayer 
then we will ever know 
and that's true 
um 
so that's the most powerful thing i can do 
when i can turn it over to god and say god this is too damn big for me to handle 
you think you can work on maybe helping change this person's heart 
or their mind 
because i can't do that 
um 
so 
you know 
i didn't mean to get 
much  much other things 
you know that i'm 
coming to understand 
there's uh 
you know i just uh is 
i had three spiritual leaders 
tell me that 
a great gift came with that 
that there was it was no accident 
it was supposed to happen 
and uh there's a word called synchronicity 
that um 
encompasses the 
uh theory that 
all things happen for a reason 
even though it seems like it's chaos 
even though it seems like it's an accident 
uh 
there's 
a flow 
of spirit in this world things 
are moving 
at a pace that they're supposed to move at 
and things happen 
and death is part of life 
physical death 
and that's one of the things i also learned through this was that 
you don't die 
you don't 
physically 
maybe 
you know 
there's no denying that 
but 
spiritually 
not even physical death can break that 
it won't 
and and the problem is uh the problem is seeing things in other people 
i mean actually seeing 
spirits 
in other people in terms of 
someone said the eyes are the mirror to the soul 
that's very true 
you know 
i could see 
in certain people's  when i was in the hospital 
the confusion 
unsure 
feelings 
you know the 
uh 
i don't know 
i didn't there's something that i could see there that i can't explain and i still can't explain it 
i just  what i  
and then i go and try and tell the psychologist psychiatrist well they want to put me on some kind of 
anti hallucinogenic 
medication and i said well listen man 
you know 
i'm not hallucinating 
and these people that hear voices 
they're not hallucinating 
they're hearing voices of spirits 
and in many cultures they will tell you most the indigenous cultures 
throughout the world will tell you 
and the history will show 
that those people were revered as gifted 
this is the only society 
that 
labels them 
mentally ill 
and  largely because of the fear of not knowing 
and not knowing how to deal with the unseen 
so 
yeah he did 
there's no doubt in my mind that he 
heard those voices now whether they were actual 
audible voices 
or 
whether they were voices from the inside 
in his own mind 
regardless it's part of that bad spirit that people have created 
not the devil 
not satan 
to the native people he doesn't  
and to me he doesn't exist 
he's a piece of shit 
but he's real 
and he's real because people give him that 
they believe in him 
they empower that 
that  of him 
empowers it 
his existence 
when you got like minded people around you know 
you can create a spirit 
a bad one 
or a good one 
so 
this boy 
whatever he did 
um 
yeah there's no doubt in my mind that he either heard 
internal voices or 
ah actual audible voices of spirits that were 
ah 
misguided spirits 
while they were here 
there are many people that were bad eggs man 

and then they physically died 
before they got a chance to live 
and when their spirit wakes up 
and finds out that they're physically dead and they can't do anything in a physical world anymore 
they want to 
draw themselves to especially if they were a bad person 
they want to draw them to 
the brightest thing 
which are 
children of light 
and as the way i put it it's kind of new agey and i don't like new agey stuff but 
you know it's  best example is moths 
from the dark when you flip on a light 
the moths will go right to it 
a child like that 
a young man like that is very impressionable very young still 
and uh these bad spirits will be 
flocked right to him 
um 
so when he did that though i mean 
there's medication out there that can help people like i said i don't wanna see people with brain injury 
with mental illness 
or with any kind of disability 
use that 
as an excuse 
for their behavior 
because 
if they were an asshole before their brain injury 
they're gonna be 
an asshole after their brain injury five times 
um 
it's magnified    
they have that choice they can say well listen 
you don't understand and blah blah blah now i've tried that 
but the best i can do now is try and advocate for myself in terms of listen 
uh i hear what you're saying 
but i'm trying to show you that 
uh 
and tell you how i work best 
so as long as you can try not to dictate to me 
and allow me some freedom 
and give me goals of what you want accomplished and give me the freedom to accomplish them the way that i can do it 
um not by quotas 
and deadlines and 
crap like that 
um 
i can show you what to do and   the struggle i'm having right now i'm trying to find employment where people will 
cut me some slack you know and i wanted to do some driving but 
you know 
uh because at least out on the road you know 
i don't have to put up with anyone's crap 
but 
long driving long distances is not good for me 
focusing and concentrating 
um 
and i i've had 
you know several accidents several tickets 
um so 
i mean i've even had uh 
you know two other head injuries 
as a result of 
the one 
trying to force myself back into what to do so i mean it's  
yeah i mean when i when you come down to these things there's uh 
people with mental illness and with a disability 
are trying to pawn off their responsibility onto 
everybody but themselves 
you know well the medical doctors if they would of 
seen this guy and given him medication he wouldn't of went out there and 
killed somebody 
you know shoulda would have could have man 
if the guy stopped taking his medication of his own free will 
that was his responsibility to take that medicine every day 
just like it's mine take mine every day 
and when i stop taking mine that was my responsibility which is why 
i don't wanna go to the legal system to try and 
make an excuse 
even though there's a 
there's a 
some law that protects people that if they were drunk 
or 
on the influence of medication or 
or off the influence of medication 
um 
in case they bought a house or signed into some kind of contract 
that they wouldn't be 
liable 
and i'm saying 
i could take that route 
but it it would cost me a lot of money that i don't have 
to get the legal defense 
and it be just 
best for me to take the responsibility like i have 
and i sold the car that i had to my sister 
uh i'm going to pay back the apartment complex that i signed a lease for 
uh 
but i'm gonna make them come after me 
uh 
i already went to court once and 
and uh 
well i even  even with the evidence being in my favor 
i mean i was only at this place three months 
i didn't do any damage to it 
um 
and the walls did not need painted i wasn't there long enough to make them dirty 
uh but um 
their own person even went through on a first run through after i moved out 
and my mother and i cleaned that thing spotless top bottom bathrooms and washed the floors and mopped the floors and everything 
and uh their own person came through an said it rated the paint an a which meant according to their system a meant no 
no painting was needed 
uh well then 
then as a result they they went through and decided since i broke the lease to uh 
you know 
get some more money out of me and go ahead and repaint it anyway and they uh scratched out the first rating and 
changed it to a lower rating 
um 
and even though that evidence was in front of a magistrate 
and he could see 
uh i'd assume he's educated and not stupid otherwise he wouldn't be a magistrate 
could see that that person did that 
and it was suspect 
ah he still ruled in their favor 
so i'm not gonna get any fairness or justice out of that but 
uh so they sent me the award saying that they decided in their favor and all that crap well 
you know fine 
uh 
but i'm not gonna 
not gonna pay them till they contact me again 
or take me to court again 
you know they got the money i don't 
um 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
well i thought about that you know i mean doing something in the animal area even as a vet assistant but 
um with domestic animals um 
there's a lot of uh 
i don't know 
how how the training 
is done with some of these animals you know some of them are 
treated very cruelly 
to get them to do what they do to even to help like blind people   
um help people that have other physical disabilities um 
you can tell from the way the   
in terms of uh 
with with the  the way the dog behaves with the person that has the disability 
uh that they been trained for um 
you can tell 
whether they've been 
trained the right way or whatever so 
i thought about that but 
you know 
um 
you know i haven't given it much more then 
you know just the thought but you know i looked in the veterinary assistant i went in there and it wasn't uh 
you know i was there just for a half a day and you know they were telling me about some of these people out there  uh 
you know i don't understand the law again but you know 
there's people out there that will go out and will buy a dog 
you know 
nice dog 
and uh because they don't wanna make the time to train it 
and spend the time with it because they take a lot of time and discipline and 
love and care 
just like a child 
um 
they more less buy a dog for a token 
you know uh a chick magnet 
you know 
a conversation piece  or some kind of trophy well here's my here's my dog my  ah yeah full 
and uh a lot of these people 
were 
uh the dogs were 
reacting in a 
they were objective you know and they  
because they weren't being paid attention to 
and they were pissing on the carpet and 
making messes and chewing things up and 
and these people would bring them in and uh 
uh have them put to sleep 
and i couldn't be part of a veterinary practice that uh did that 
and unfortunately 
they have to do what the people with the pets say 
but it's just i couldn't be around that and  you know i would go off on people that would do that bring that in 
i just feel that would be the right thing to do punch them in the mouth 
ah i'm not a violent man either even as big as i am you know you know 
yeah up on bethel road 
that's 
uhhum 
yeah i 
yeah like i said i don't know i i just i got to make some decisions here 
you know uh i don't want to put too much pressure on it you know one of the elders told me hey you know 
cut yourself some slack and just 
relax for awhile 
you know because i worked in a movie theatre for a year 
and you know i got hassled 
and 
about my hair 
you know 
uh 
told me the only thing keeping me from 
moving up in the company was a pair of scissors 
you know and i just told him well it has to do with my belief system so you're in violation of the first amendment 
you know 
and then they realized that i wasn't stupid 
so 
you know they just made things more and more difficult for me 
you know so i just decided to 
since they weren't gonna 
change i was just gonna leave 
you know 
but 
so it's you know  it's a hard  
you choose   uh if you're not idealistic person it's 
i mean just more so me i i don't 
like i said i don't try and dwell on the negative you know but 
uh it very easy to get sucked in to what's wrong out there 
and it's also very easy to get sucked into the attitude well i'm gonna change this 
you know if you  
you do what you can do as a human being 
that alone 
is good enough 
and and that's what a lot of people are telling me you know just 
you know 
life's a struggle 
anyway 
you know so 
just simply living 
you know for me getting out of bed 
is 
is a victory 
you know 
for the longest time i was so depressed 
you know but 
the animals you know yeah using the animals uh 
uh for therapy animal therapy um 
i mean dogs in particular cats 
um 
but know there's 
uh there's some animals that aren't 
to be pets you know 
um they're wild animals 
you know and 
yeah i saw a show last week on fox that 
was called when good pets go bad too 
and none of the animals they profiled were pets 
i mean a thirty six foot long python what the hell's a person doing with that as a pet 
they shouldn't be allowed to 
and then people treating a buffalo 
like they could stand next to it and take a family picture 
doesn't show any knowledge or respect to the animal 
that's a very strong animal and as the old man that got lifted twenty five feet in the air against the pine tree found out 
my opinion when that stuff happens when i see 
when i see someone light the horns of a bull on fire in spain and torment the bull and then all of a sudden the bull gets the flames put out 
and the bull runs his gourd through 
the person's leg and throws him around and kicks him right near death i don't have any sympathy for him 
oh i'm not shocked to the bad behavior of the  i don't consider it's justice 
well i mean 
well the humans that started it and the man narrating the thing said there wasn't a single animal that they profiled in the thing that uh 
um 
behaved the way it did on it's own accord 
it behaved that way as a result of the way it was being treated by human beings 
so i mean there's a i mean 
yeah the animal therapy is very good thing my dog has been very 
um 
supportive been very 
you know like you said the unconditional love part you know i mean how you could 
you could 
you could leave for a week and come back and they're 
they're like ok 
i'm glad you're back you know 
none of this where have you been 

okay 
yes pets are 
okay 
i was born in dayton ohio 
i lived there almost thirty five years before moving to columbus in nineteen eighty one 
uh lived in uh 
north west columbus for eighteen years 
uh moved last january a little farther west about five miles further west near hilliard 
but still live in the city of columbus 
uh so i've been here about eighteen nineteen years i like columbus also 
i think it's a great city although the last three months i've threatened to move on more than one occasion because of all the traffic congestion and all of the road construction you just can't get anywhere 
it's very frustrating 
uh but other than that columbus is a great city 
um 
i went to this is something different about me most people don't know that uh it it existed in the the twentieth century but i went to an all girl catholic school for twelve years 
uh so there were there were no boys and i wasn't in a classroom with boys until i got to college 
uh i went to college at wright state university 
uh my parents couldn't afford to send me so i had to work two years in high school two years after high school to pay my way through college 
um 
taught school for about eight and a half nine years and during that time got my masters degree in remedial reading 
um taught for i 
think i said this about eight and a half nine years and 
my 
life and career took a whole different turn and became president of my teachers' association or teachers' union and 
that led to a job in political action because i'd always been active in politics from high school on 
uh the first campaign i worked in was for john kennedy in nineteen sixty i was a freshman in high school and 
continued working in campaigns in a volunteer status uh several different campaigns in ohio and in dayton where i came from 
uh but moved to columbus to take a job as a political action consultant for the largest public employee union 
did that for a couple of years till i went out in the field and negotiated labor contracts 
um 
did that that's kind of stressful um um 
so i decided to strike off on my own and try some public relations and marketing and did that and 
um 
i'm 
never been married 
didn't plan that that wasn't a goal in life it just 
uh so i have no kids but i have a pet 
and now i'm uh i call myself semi retired i get a small um you know monthly retirement and then i supplement my income by doing things like this 
i'm an independent contractor i do training i do um 
different things you know where people get my opinion i've done a couple of the um things with uh 
lawyers looking you know they do like mock trials 
on real issues 
and then you listen to all of the stuff and then you 
you know pretend that you're a jury and come up with a decision and i guess they use it in forming their case 
going to going into court so that's fun 
so that's a little bit about me uh lets see 
my family my mom and dad 
um well i'm i'm 
uh my mother was first generation 
american my grandparents came to this country from hungary 
and that was a neat experience i liked growing up talking to my grandfather about what life was like as a peasant in hungary 
uh and he thought this was the  greatest country in the world and that rubbed off on me i still do also 
he always voted so 
you know 
i learned at an early age that it's important to vote 
um 
my mom and dad were both alcoholics 
um i have two brothers no sisters 
one older than me one younger than me 
um and i have no children but i have a pet that is my child 
and i always say pets are uh children you raise pets you spoil 
so my my pet is 
very spoiled 
that's right 
it's a parakeet 
a parakeet yes 
little two and a half three ounce ball of fluff 
oh yeah 
oh 
wow yeah 
uhhum 
i had that with uh 
the parakeet i had before 
their lifespan in the wild is about five years seven years in captivity and he was thirteen 
yeah 
uhhum 
right 
the hardest  both the hardest and easiest thing i think i've ever done 
was knowing when it was time to take him to the vet to have him euthanized 
uhhum 
yeah 
hum 
right 
you know you have to you know you don't have a choice but at the same time you  right you don't want them to suffer but you want to keep them 
but 
it is 
whoops 
oops 
i hope i didn't move 
put my hand here 
try to keep it out the line of the 
wire 
yeah no problem 
yes 
uhhum 
uhhum 
right 
right 
uhhum 
me too 
yeah i really don't know 
i don't understand why they don't because to me 
it's the most important freedom we have 
and people v um 
bitch and complain all the time 
but then when you ask them if they voted they go no it makes no difference well it makes no difference if you don't because your voice 
wasn't heard 
um 
when i was a political action consultant for the ohio education association i used to go around try to get teachers involved in politics 
um and one of the things i would tell them is that 
every vote is important john kennedy won if if 
if you would take all of the the votes he won by and spread it out across the nation 
by one vote per  
per precinct 
one vote per precinct 
you know if there had just been one additional vote either way in any of those precincts you know he would have lost 
uh and so one vote does count 
and i used to have a list of elections that were decided by one or two votes 
and when i was with the ohio education association i generally did school levy campaigns and many of them are decided by one two seven 
eighteen nineteen votes 
um 
if i knew the magic 
reason why people don't vote 
i could sell that 
and make a 
make a fortune 
um but i don't know what it is 
when i did school levy campaigns 
uh and a couple of other campaigns to me the biggest thing is is 
what the  the 
campaign does on election day called get out the vote 
that's the most important thing that can be done 
um 
i used to 
always at the beginning of a a campaign for a school levy 
get a list of all the registered voters and of course i had a very limited population in a school district 
and i would have the school district compare it to 
parents and the first thing i'd do is register parents 
because many of them 
don't vote 
uh and i read a study somewhere that the average person in this country doesn't even begin to vote until they're forty 
if i had known that when i was in college 
and worked so hard to get the vote changed to eighteen because i couldn't vote till i was twenty one 
and i was upset 
you know because i wanted to vote for certain candidates because of the vietnam war 
that was a big issue and i couldn't 
uh i had to wait till i was twenty one so there were a bunch of us at college that 
you know worked and did some volunteer work to get that whole thing changed 
if i'd known that they weren't gonna vote at eighteen 
and they were gonna wait until they were almost forty 
i wouldn't of i wouldn't of wasted my time 
um but anyway um 
you get parents who are usually younger especially of the the first second third grade age 

and you register them 
and then you just keep after them you keep giving them information and then you just run a good get out the vote campaign 
uh in ohio i think it's easier to do that because there is a law that 
i don't think it's in primaries 
but in general elections at eleven o'clock in the morning and four o'clock in the afternoon 
they hafta list those who have voted they hafta put up a list of uh 
registered voters and cross out those who have voted 
so what i used to do is i took my list that i had gotten from the board of elections earlier and compared it with my list of who had shown support 
or  was undecided on the election 
and i would cross off those that had voted 
and then i had a list of those that hadn't 
and i had people waiting at a phone bank 
and i'd call them at work or at home and and i'd offer to take them to the polls 
if you don't have a ride 
uh we will take you to the polls 
if you're worried about you know someone watching your kids we have certified teachers who will sit in the car with your kid or will sit in your home and will babysit for you while you go to vote 
because i've also read studies that say people who are routed from their home or their office 
you know and are reminded to go vote 
will also vote for whatever issue or candidate has reminded them to do that 
because what i did was is a very low key thing i would call people on election day and say 
hi this is roberta i'm calling to remind you that today is election day and we hope that you will remember to exercise your most important freedom which is to go vote 
and oh by the way 
oh when you go to vote we hope that you will vote for such and such a school levy and 
and if you need a ride let me know we've got them set up for you 
and 
but you know that's very 
i mean  and and that's not getting people to vote 
and encourage them to vote because they should that's a a special campaign for a particular issue or a candidate 
i don't know how you get people to vote 
i don't know why they don't think it's important maybe because 
we've had it too easy my  
my grandfather didn't 
my grandfather didn't i mean there was a king and queen and you know he had no right to vote 
so that when he came here and he could 
that was the most important thing in the world to him 
you know and that that he just passed it on to 
you know his daughter my mother 
my father i don't know how he 
it was important to him but it was always important to him and we talked about politics at the dinner table sometimes 
we talked about 
issues and he said you know it was important to to be heard 
so i don't know if it was that 
it got passed on parent wise or what it was 
uhhum 
there's no issue 
uhhum 
right 
not specifically no 
uh sometimes um little groups 
of 
sometimes you   if there was a college in a community when i was running a school levy campaign 
um we would try to get them either registered 
and and active in a campaign 
um 
but it was very difficult 
it's sort of like getting people who live in a trailer park 
active in voting 
you know there are certain little blocks of people 
uh and on school levies the people who voted no which were senior citizens 
i mean they they went to the polls in droves you didn't hafta you know the the the  
the hope there was that they wouldn't go to vote 
on the school levy 
uh but actually trying to get college kids involved 
i haven't really specifically done that as a whole campaign in and of itself 
it might be a little pocket of a campaign but 
nothing big 
uhhum 
if if you didn't own let's say on a school levy and you didn't uh you 
you pay taxes i always get because i rent and i always get very upset and i'm very angry when people say 
well you don't hafta pay school taxes yes i do because every time a school tax passes 
my rent goes up 
it's built into the rent 
uh at least it's 
it ought to be or i have a pretty dumb landlord 
uh and i don't i've never lived any place where my rent didn't go up after a school levy passed and usually in direct f proportion and beyond  you know uh of what the levy was 
uh so that would be the first thing i'd say 
and then i'd also say that you know 
uh because a  a  a number of reasons that people don't vote for school levies now is because they don't have kids 
in the schools 
you know but education is the foundation of a democracy 
and if you don't have an educated citizenry 
uh  your  
democracy could go down the drain 
um that was why thomas jefferson founded so many schools or you know the the university of virginia and believed in education you know because he said without an educated citizenry you won't understand the issues 
you know but it's very difficult today 
to get to people 
um 
i've talked to some 
i've 
almost college age students and they don't see the relationship you can 
talk logic to them all you want and it's not like the logic gets to them 
and you can talk history all you want and it doesn't mean anything to them and i don't know why 
i wish i did but i don't know why 
i think the latter i don't think it will make any difference 
the kids that i know 
in uh junior high and in in you know college 
uh it just doesn't make any difference to them and they don't like those classes they think they're boring they think it has no relevance to their life 
yeah 
it 
it might and you know good teachers do that i i  i still get upset when i was teaching school i did activity based teaching 
um 
and i was doing some volunteer work at dublin schools it was supposed be one of the better schools in the area 
and i thought there'd be all sorts of creative things going on and there wasn't it was still read the chapter write the answers to the questions at the end of the book and i thought 
how boring i mean there are different ways to get kids turned on to things 
um 
i'm not sure there's so much 
influence from the media 
uh and i say media broad based so you'd be it print media or tv 
um that has this culture today of um 
stars and you know media of of 
phenomenons and 
and 
they don't see the relevance and i don't think they hear from their parents like i did 
the importance of voting and that's where it comes from their parents don't vote 
so if their parents don't vote they aren't 
uh again i don't know what the the answer is 
um but it's very scary what's gonna happen in the next couple of generations 
the only 
good thought for me is i think about this 
is that i won't be here to see the disintegration of the democracy although i have great faith too 
i have great faith in democracy 
um 
there are always good people that somehow come up and i think if there were an issue 
i think kids would  if if there were 
kids in college that were being drafted and being sent to die in a war that people didn't think was important 
or had no real relevance to their lives 
i mean 
i think the kids would 
would rally immediately 
and  the issue right now is that there's nothing there 
right 
the  
uhhum 
it 
it might 
uh it might 
um i was gonna say earlier and i and i forgot to mention it is that one of the best campaigns i've seen in recent years utilizing college age students has been clinton's campaign both times 
uh he knew he needed to get a base to increase 
um his chances of winning the election 
and did especially in the first campaign in and and i believe that was ninety two 
did a really super job of organizing college students because that's when you're at your most um 
well when you believe in things and you're at your most idealistic 
and you would think that you know 
kids would automatically be interested in something and he was able to tap into that 
um 
in addition to that 
and as an 
under current it wasn't 
overt in the clinton campaign 
but i know when i talked to people 
uh and you have to be careful where you do this because abortion is an a very divisive issue in this country and i think it it does mobilize people 
but it also divides them 
you know  definitively almost like in vietnam almost like that war divided people 
um but i would tell many many women that they had to vote for clinton 
because it was the difference between protecting roe versus wade and not 
and in protecting choice you know i um 
and i i'm starting to see that now even in in the gore campaign there i've seen a couple of editorials in the paper 
about you know the next president will again have an opportunity to appoint two to three 
supreme court justices and at that if you want to protect that right 
you've gotta vote with the candidate who's gonna put the best justices on the supreme court 
and i got a lot of people to vote for clinton that way  
both in ninety two and again in four years  in ninety six 
uh and i think that's gonna happen again 
uh because the 
the candidates and i'm telling you my politics here 
and early 
but the candidates have pretty well spoken on that issue already 
i know which one will 
protect the right 
for choice 
uh and 
um 
uh i think we need to protect that so yes i think it will but i don't think it's an 
issue that if you 
did 
overtly and said you know support candidate a over candidate b 
because they will protect abortion rights 
that's gonna divide the country and not keep us together 
uhhum 
right 
uhhum 
and that's essentially what the supreme court said in their last decision on this two three years ago what they said was whether we think it's right or wrong whether we think the previous supreme 
court was right or wrong 
it's been a part of this fabric of this country for more than ten years and to reverse it 
would 
create too much 
too many problems for people 
you know which i thought was a nice way of saying sorry folks but you know it's too late 
right 
uhhum 
uhhum 
which meant she'd never get the nomination because of who controls the republican party 

she was but i had admired her more 
yeah because um 
uh until the moderates get control of the republican party again 
that's gonna be the litmus test 
and it's just like back in in the sixties and the seventies when the extreme left wing had control of the democratic party 
they would nominate such people as uh mcgovern who hadn't you know who i voted for but had no chance of winning 
over the years i have moderated my 
hardline left of center liberal stance 
for more of a moderate 
middle of the road 
because it's easier to get that sold to the american public 
um 
so uh 
while 
i think dole was correct 
um 
i think she yeah she shot herself in the foot 
i don't she would have never gotten the nomination as long as the party remains the way that it is 
being controlled by the extreme right wing 
which is a problem for the republicans they moved they need to move towards the middle 
which i think george w is trying to do 
um 
uh 
uh whenever anybody tells me that i go tell i tell them yes and i'm an  
uh 
an indifferent liberal 
uhhum 
uhhum 
right 
if she could have become the candidate 
she might have been able to beat 
i think almost anybody can beat gore right now but you know 
and in in election times 
a weekend 
is a couple of centuries uh uh a year 
is an 
eon 
so anything can happen between now and then but 
i think 
uh dole had a good chance of being elected because most americans are moderate and will go with the moderate candidate 
uh 
which is basically where clinton 
placed himself in the two elections he ran in 
um 
most real democrats the warren beatty's of the world and many 
you know congressmen  and senators dislike clinton 
because   they didn't think he was democratic enough 
um 
i liked clinton because as i said over the years  i've learned that 
extremes in either party don't get elected 
and that if you want someone 
that has your 
general interest at heart you hafta find someone who's a moderate and can can appeal to everybody 
i used to tell school districts when i went in to tell them how to to put together a school levy campaign that basically you had 
the rule of thirties and that had nothing to do with my 
age 
but that there was about 
thirty percent of the people who were 
were for you 
with the yes votes thirty percent who were automatically against you the no votes 
and thirty percent in between 
i told them ignore the no votes 
you know just 
just don't get them upset with you you don't want them you know working actively against you 
lock up  
your thirty that are with you make sure you 
you know you do something with them but 
this group the the middle thirties i call them 
you had to massage them 
and that's what clinton did so well and that's what dole could have done i'm not sure if george w is gonna be able to 
uh because to get the the nomination eventually he's gonna come out and have to make his hard statements to those people which is i'm anti abortion 
i'm pro gun he's already said the pro gun 
and that's because it's going against 
what most americans are saying 
dole i think represented where most americans are if you look at opinion polls 
um so  you know you hafta find a way to  to moderate that stance 
uh whether you're republican or a democrat 
oh yeah 
i think it's possible 
it'd have to take the right combination 
of uh someone who can appeal to the party people and get the nomination and appeal to the people 
i think dole would have been a good candidate i would have been hard pressed 
i mean uh to some of her issues i don't like but 
when she came out 
uh and said her her her famous thing on the abortion issue when she came out against guns 
uh she went up a  couple of notches in in in my estimation because i wasn't sure where she'd be 
i thought she'd have to sell herself as hardline with the hardline republicans 
and then i wouldn't have been able to vote for her 
uhhum 
except you couldn't come right out and say you wouldn't you didn't want to vote for her because she was a woman there'd have to be an under current 
i think there might be but i think most of them are a dying breed 
they're the older citizens 
um 
many in my generation uh they'd just probably be 
because  i'm the early baby boom i'm i'm the first of the baby boom 
uh and that's when the woman's movement started and many men there still haven't always accepted that so there there might be a problem there but for the 
the the the generations even the later baby boom generations behind me 
when i talk to them i talk to uh high school students or even young college students 
um 
there there's a a whole world of difference between their attitudes in a lot of things and 
you know women's minority issues uh they just second hand to them it it doesn't 
you know 
it's 
not 
like it was for us which was a sea change 
for them it's normal 
so and more of those people are 
in the voting population 
if they would vote 
you know you'd have to find a candidate who would know how to do what clinton did in ninety two and get out that college vote 
that that um 
that's an interesting question because he was a  
a serious contender last time i haven't heard his name this time 
um 
what people say they would do  you know that they like him 
because he is um intelligent charismatic 
uh all those  neat things that you need to 
to be elected today 
um 
and a lot of people said they would vote for him but what they say in polls they don't know if it would translate over but yeah i think he could 
i think the right candidate could and i think mike coleman this year 
uh in the columbus race showed that 
i mean he crossed 
gender lines he crossed 
um 
party lines he crossed over into all of the city 
and winning even dorothy teater's 
precinct which surprised me 
you know  and not by just a little small margin i think it was two hundred and some votes which is pretty substantial 
well 
right 
yeah 
well teater's a school board member for columbus 
yeah 
uhhum 
right 
that's that's really hard to say um 
if she was a younger woman and ran the campaign that she ran 
negatives don't work in columbus 
columbus really does have a heart 
and that just doesn't play 
in columbus what plays in the state 
and and the people who ran her campaign ran voinovich's campaign and 
betty montgomery's campaign and and that negative stuff worked statewide 
that doesn't work so well in columbus 
um 
i i think that it'd 
even a younger woman who ran that particular campaign would have lost 
um 
and i like to think that age doesn't matter but she came across as old to me also 
and i like to think i'm not prejudiced on 
on any issue but if there's uh 
someone who had been right on the issues 
i don't care if she was old i would have voted for her she just didn't support the issues i supported 
she was wrong on 
uh i i didn't like that she tried to use um the police chief 
in such a negative way by saying that um 
coleman had voted for a raise for the chief 
well yes he voted for a raise for the chief but he voted for a raise for the the police 
officers 
it's just that you know the police chief's was tied to his 
and i don't like people who try to manipulate facts 
uh and and that was manipulating the facts i didn't like that she was um 
uh 
uh  against 
the the the tiff 
uh and polaris once it was voted i thought it was more important whether it was right or wrong and i don't think it was wrong to begin with 
but once it was voted and in place i thought our reputation was on the line and for her to try to use another divisive issue just to get elected 
didn't sit well with me 
um so i don't even if she had a lot of charisma 
charisma doesn't mean as much to me 
as a person's stand 
on the issues but i think it does mean a lot to other people so i can't really answer that question how they would have voted 
uh because i didn't think that mike coleman exactly had charisma either 
his youth 
uhhum 
right 
and uh and that's really an important issue right now i i i saw that the first time in nineteen ninety two because 
i 
uh uh uh 
i haven't said it yet but 
you know anyone who listening to this tape or you would be able to know i'm a democrat and generally vote democratic although 
i will tell you i 
i did vote for 
greg lashuka once and if he had run again i would have voted for him because i like his style 
and he hasn't been bad for the city but 
um i'm generally a democrat 
uh and i've only voted for two people who won the presidential election and i knew in ninety two early on that clinton was gonna win just by 
being out with people and i was at a restaurant one time with my girlfriend 
and a waiter came up and um 
he said something about you know 
and i can't remember how we got started on the topic 
you know just taking my my order for a restaurant but he said something about um 
uh dole was too old 
and this was a young guy he was in college 
and i knew there was there was a  a  a sort of a shift 
people wanted someone 
with younger ideas 
and um 
a new vision they didn't want the world war two vision anymore 
uh and i thought that was was was kind of interesting because by and large most young people also supported reagan and i thought 
do they really understand the difference 
in 
issues 
and what the two stand for but it was that reagan appeared young and charismatic and so did clinton 
so i think for the average voter that does have a 
a lot of sway 
i'm not sure yet 
um 
at least based on money raised it looks like george w could trample almost anybody 
but george w hasn't gotten out there in the fray yet and given too many answers to 
issues 
he talks about compassionate conservativism and i don't know what that means 
you know i i want answers to specific questions as to what does compassionate conservative mean but 
i don't think that i'm 
uh 
average in that i don't go for the the the slick image  bothers me 
um he has the potential of  of trampling gore i think that gore will be the the nominee no matter what bradley does gore has it sewn up because he's the insider 
um 
at 
yeah i  uh i think they're both boring 
if you look at the the image thing 
they're both fairly wooden neither one of them seems comfortable in front of a camera 
uh it's interesting on 
on bradley 
my boyfriend is is big in sports 
he's he's 
not as liberal as i am he's a little bit on the conservative side 
um 
and he but he would support bradley simply because he was a  
a a former uh basketball player 
and i'm about ready to say to him at some point in time you know if he becomes president he's you're gonna hate him because he has all of these big government things and you're against big government 
um so i don't think people always always see that but 
um between gore and bradley i don't see much difference quite frankly bradley's the more liberal 
um 
gore i think understands the need to compromise but i think gore will be the 
the candidate i don't think bradley will be able to go past 
all of the work that gore's been doing for eight years as vice president 
well see that's not proved out by the 
the approval ratings he still has 
higher approval rating than reagan had in his last eighteen months so you know people still like what he what he's done 
i think that that 
um that you know people don't like all the crap that went with him as the  on tv 
you know  say that and they're they're still trying to get him 
i mean before he was even elected they were trying to get him 
which is what they would have done  elizabeth dole 
they wouldn't have been able to attack 
on the issues so they'd find other things to get 
get her on so they start bringing out all these women and all that stuff on 
and 
most people didn't care about it 
they didn't care about it before the election they didn't care about it 
during his campaign they didn't care about it during his presidency 
it  
republican right wing 
i don't know what who were just trying to make an issue out of nothing it was not watergate 
you know he may have been a  you know he may have 
you know but 
she was twenty-one it's not like it was someone who couldn't make up her own mind what she wanted to do 
you know and he may have been stupid and a cad uh but i don't wanna know about it 
on day one when it hit the the news 
i didn't want to know about it 
and on the end when he was 
you know not impeached 
i didn't wanna know about it 
and in between i didn't wanna know about it and they just kept 
angering me because there were other things i wanted 
the government to do 
and this congress is the worst i've ever seen in not getting anything done and not really being able to 
be on the  of of where america is on such issues as gun control and women's rights and and things that are important to people 
you know 
they they've tried to make pseudo issues out of clinton and then they tried to make a pseudo issue out of you know giving a tax cut 
people don't want a tax cut when it's going to affect their social security or affect 
you know 
uh the the the deficit 
you know to get a a four or five dollar a  tax cut 
when they're giving a four or five thousand dollar a year to someone who's making two hundred three hundred thousand dollars i don't care if i get five dollars that won't even buy me a tank of gas today 
keep the money 
and do something good with it 
so um 
i don't know 
uhhum 
you know 
even republicans are like that 
uh i have a friend in new jersey or two friends 
uh a married couple she's a  a lifelong democrat he's been a lifelong republican 
uh and there's always interesting discussions when um when i go to visit and i went to visit them 
few weeks before clinton was formally impeached last year 
and i just decided i wasn't gonna bring it up 
uh and i'd been there three four days and finally at breakfast one morning henry said well you haven't talked about clinton and the impeachment yet and i said henry 
because he's the republican i said 
i don't even wanna go there 
let i said i don't even think we we wanna get involved in that conversation he says well he says i can understand you saying that but i thought you'd you know i wanna tell you where i am 
he said when this whole thing started 
i sat down and wrote 
every one of my 
um new jersey representatives 
all of my senators and all of the congress people in new jersey 
and told them that i will never 
ever in my life 
vote republican again 
because of the way this has has played out 
i mean and this was a republican a lifelong republican he says i will 
always now vote democrat because this was just so stupid and such a waste of my my time 
the country's time 
the country's money 
uh when there are better things to be dealing with and a lot of republicans felt that way you  to be really extreme right wing 
to feel other than that 
except here in central ohio 
uhhum 
right 
uhhum 
right 
right 
doesn't even 
right 
i know 
i wouldn't 
i 
i 
there generally tends be at least one or two republicans i vote for each 
each election now sometimes i voted straight democrat because i  you know i even voted for dorothy teater the first time she ran for county commissioner 
uh because i liked her style and i thought she was nice and and i liked what she was saying but then her votes 
later on and her positions on some of the issues were against mine so i  i didn't vote for her after that 
but the first time she ran for county commissioner 
i did it one because she was a woman and i like you know i i when possible i like to vote for women 

if they hold you know enough of my views 
i'm not gonna vote for a woman 
just because they're a woman 
and i'm not gonna vote for a democrat just because they're a democrat 
they better have 
uh you know at least and  and i don't need a hundred percent 
uh so that a agreement with my views but i'd like they'd be at in the ninety to ninety five percent range 
um but 
yeah uh i will uh i don't tend to vote straight party line either 
as i said i've i've moderated from when i was 
uh 
in 
college 
to today part of the the aging process and 
also partly because 
i've 
i've noticed that to get things done you hafta have a center 
and it's the center that tends to rule 
when i was in college 
um 
we had a bumper sticker that said america fix it or forget it 
and some of the construction people in dayton came out with one that said america love it or leave it 
uh and today i realize that both of those positions are wrong it's america love it 
and fix it just like with your kids you love your kids but you don't let them 
you know have bad manners at the table and you don't let them run around with the wrong you know kids and you want them to behave well 
you know that's how i see america now and 
and america's become more centrist 
uh and when it 
deviates from that either way that's when people become upset 
um 
so i just think it's important and i 
i remember when um 
who was the other president that i voted for that won 
carter 
uh 
black leaders would meet with him once a week and then they'd come out and hold this press conference and complain about he didn't do this for blacks he didn't do  enough for blacks he didn't do this and he didn't do that 
and i used to say  to some my black friends 
don't you see what you're doing don't you see that greater implications of this 
oh no we need to have him move faster i said 
you know that'd be great 
in an ideal world this isn't an ideal world 
you hafta take it a step at a time whether you like it or not 
i said what you're gonna do is you're gonna make it look like he is so bad in all the issues you're gonna give people a reason to vote against him 
then if any big issue comes up 
that's just gonna be added to everything else 
i said what you need to do is after you have this meeting with him is come out and praise him and that he's doing a good job and that we're moving along steadily 
uh and i you know i don't think sometimes people who do politics of the negative understand what it means 
um i made that mistake when i was president the dayton education association we were trying to get a levy passed 
so we went around as teachers showing all of the bad conditions in the school all the leaking  you know 
uh ceilings all of the peeling floors all the the bad chalk boards with cracks in them and all that kind of stuff 
and it had the opposite effect of what we thought people thought the schools were so bad they said we're not gonna support those 
and they voted no 
so the next time we did an opposite track we went in and we said you know um the 
eighteen months later when the board put  um 
uh  
levy on the the ballot 
we said these are great schools we have great teachers look at this kid he's learning to read he's made six months improvement in three months and all that kind 
it was 
image 
and it we were saying the same thing you know we want to continue this we want to make even this better 
um 
we learned to say the negatives in a positive way and that's important 
you know and and you need to get that  that 
you need to appeal to the center 
american's don't like extreme 
liberals they don't like extreme conservatives 
you know  they  
they want peace 
uhhum 
right 
i think it's the right 
position to take 
um but it 
it like abortion that's one of the the big  
issues that divide people very quickly 
uh i think it's moderating somewhat 
uh as the gay activists continue their campaigns 
um 
but that's one where a candidate has to tread very carefully 
um i was proud that coleman said it and didn't 
and didn't back down on that 
um they 
told me a little bit about his character 
um 
i don't know that i can answer your question straight forward because 
i believe in gay  
i believe in anybody's rights 
what happens between consenting adults in a bedroom is their business not mine 
uhhum 
not if he'd been as open about it  as he was here 
um 
you know clinton did that also and and thought he'd be able to 
um 
or not segregate desegregate the uh the the military and found out with his first 
action 
as president that 
there there's a strong backlash against that at least nation wide and and and in the military 
but i thought it was the right stance 
um 
because it's more open 
um 
and you couch it in terms of civil rights 
um 
my boyfriend's 
thinks it's wrong morally 
but doesn't think we ought to be discriminating against 
uh he he thinks it's a sin 
therefore he thinks they should repent and the way to do that is through 
you know talking to them religion wise 
um 
i don't think it's a sin 
i think that 
um your sexuality 
is genetic based 
and that 
i 
you can no more change 
your sexual orientation than you can the color of your eyes or your hair you may put a dye on it or you may put a different 
um 
whatever those 
eye  pieces are 
contacts 
i don't wear glasses so i can never remember those terms 
um 
but that's just cosmetic 
and anyone who tries to change their sexual orientation that's cosmetic too 
uh 
and again 
my belief is whatever happens between consenting adults is their business not mine 
um 
so i don't know that 
anyone could change it 
what was your question again 
why people 
because of the gay activism 
uhhum 
yeah i was gonna say most them are 
i think so because i 
i 
when 
in the fifties and sixties you very seldom saw black people 
on t v and then you start seeing a couple of black people on t v and then there was the jeffersons and although i found that jeffersons offensive in many ways because it was stereotypical and 
made fun of of of black people 
in many ways in retrospect 
it was trend setting 
and what it did in in even in putting blacks 
in 
um 
advertisements on t v 
young kids saw them 
uh  and saw those ads and saw those t v programs 
and so it became 
uh 
a part of everyday life 
the more you see something the more it  
becomes more acceptable 
so maybe that is having an effect maybe fifty years from now we will look back on those t v programs and 
think they were trend setting instead of stereotypical 
um 
but it i'm sure it does have uh 
some influence because 
i think it did 
it wasn't 
the 
only thing that had an influence 
but it was one of the little 
pieces 
of the puzzle that that helps 
i think matthew shepherd helped 
also 
not in my lifetime 
he'd hafta  
probably be a closet gay 
mean there are gays in congress there are gays in the military 
and just as long as people don't know that they don't feel threatened 
see  and and i  i uh i  i don't understand that mindset i really don't i don't know why 
uh a man feels threatened by a having gay near them 
um 
i have a couple of gay friends and and one of my friends always says um 
you know does 
every man like every woman he sees is he attracted to every woman and you know want to go to bed with every woman 
you know what makes a man think that just because i'm gay 
i might be interested in him you know that's the height of arrogance 
um you know but but men feel threatened by that just as i guess women feel threatened by lesbians i don't know but 
it's not a mindset i have so it's hard for me to understand 
right 
yeah i don't understand it i really have a hard time understanding you know 
they're not after you 
they just want to live a life 
uhhum 
yeah 
uhhum 
hm 
uhhum 
i bet you have 
you just 
i'm not sure where my father would have been and my father was very liberal 
uh more so even than my mother 
um 
because if it's not something that's part of your culture every day 
you know and and you've been told it's wrong and the catholic church said it was wrong as  
most religions do 
i'm sure he would've 
you know had some 
concern but i think his his 
intellect 
would eventually have worked it out especially if you sat down and talked with him 
and he wouldn't have done you know there wouldn't have been any gay bashing with him and 
um 
there wouldn't have been 
you know what happened you know to the the black man in jasper texas and the you know 
uh the 
the shepard boy in in 
what was that oklahoma 
uh you know he wouldn't of 
yeah 
hate crime is a is an 
is an 
interesting 
term 
um 
all crimes all murders 
are hate related i uh 
i'm not sure 
it that's 
uh it it's difficult i 
we had civil rights laws many people were opposed to those but 
it was uh in an effort to correct 
years 
of 
institutionalized racism 
um 
and and maybe something like that is needed to stop years of institutionalized hate 
but 
a crime is a crime and you know are you going to give someone who murdered matthew shepard 
six life terms as opposed to someone who murders someone else one life term i mean murder is murder 
and there's already a a law on the books so i don't think we need to have 
a hate crime 
over and above that 
you know 
uh 
the   the people who murdered matthew shepard 
should be tried and hopefully 
convicted on the facts 
and shouldn't have anything else added into it 
i 
i think doing that is going to do the same thing that the many of the civil rights and the 
uh affirmative action programs and the busing did to people it's going to turn people against 
uh 
gays like it turned people against blacks for a while although 
ultimately i think it did make a difference 
i  
i had a 
i have a black friend at the ohio education association who was very active in the sixties 
in uh opening up restaurants in the south 
and 
marching and you know going to you know opening the schools in the south 
and 
i said to her one day are you disappointed that 
things aren't better 
uh you know that people still hate blacks this was ten fifteen years ago and she said no she said that wasn't my goal 
my goal wasn't to change hearts and minds 
my goal was to change behavior 
and the behavior changed 
except now 
i never thought i would live to see an 
all white jury 
convict white men 
of  of killing a black man 
we're in hearts and minds now 
uhhum 
an all white jury 
two white men and the third one's on trial now be interesting to see what happens to him because he says he didn't have that big a role in it 
right 
uhhum 
yeah but 
but but many people 
especially its a kid that young 
may not know what that really means 
and may it's to be part of the group and part of the you know be cool may go along with it when really they don't like it i don't i haven't made up my mind about him whether he's telling the truth or whether he hasn't 
or whether he wasn't 
well yeah me either 
yeah 
but i've been in situations 
where people have told racist jokes and sometimes i let it pass because you do have to pick 
the time to to challenge someone very carefully 
but in other situations i've said 
i don't find those types of jokes funny please don't tell them anymore 
in my presence 
do what you want when you're with your other friends but don't do it in front of me 
i don't even like blonde jokes i find those 
sexist and um 
racist in a way 
and i  i  no one will tell them to me one day when 
i was still working in an office there were telling fifteen or twenty of them in a row and 
i just kept a stone face but at one or two i did 
but they were trying to get me to laugh but i wouldn't 
but um 
right you gotta pick your battles right 
yep 
uhhum 
uhhum 
right 

yes 
um 
well 
i was raised 
most of my life in ashland 
it's about 
ten minutes north of mansfield ohio 
and um 
i uh 
we moved there 
we move there from mansfield 
so i've been living in the mansfield ashland area for 
about uh 
thirteen years i think 
my dad uh 
once he got through with his residency 
and everything 
we moved to mansfield and he joined a practice and we've been living there ever since 
um mansfield's 
about 
i'd say fifty five sixty thousand people 
and ashland is probably about twenty five to thirty thousand people 
but um 
mansfield 
is 
sort of fascinating to 
per capita murder rate in mansfield is higher than anywhere else in 
in ohio 
um it's just it's very industrialized there's the 
there's a lot of um 
a certain community that lives there 
that normally wouldn't live in a smaller city like that 
there's just a lot of 
there's a lot of crime in mansfield 
um 
there's a steel factory there's a 
uh not really there's all sorts of 
there's all sorts 
of  of um 
industry 
in the mansfield area 
but 
there's a lot of it 
no actually most of it most of it stayed 
most of it stayed it's  it's been there for 
a while 
yeah we've got the mansfield state reformatory where shawshank redemption was 
where shawshank redemption was recorded 
yep 
yep 
well i don't know if that's our claim to fame but 
but we do we do have that in mansfield 
but um 
ashland is a little bit more 
and a little bit more of what mat affects a  
lot more locates more of a 
it's more of a um agricultural 
county 
um ashland city 
is 
right where i live it's you know i mean we're like five minutes outside of ashland city 
but ashland city's the county seat for ashland county 
and um 
mansfield is the county seat for richland county 
yeah 
but 
everybody does everything in mansfield because there's nothing to do in ashland 
but uh 
the mansfield branch campus for o s u's there 
well 
growing up in mansfield was um 
uh yeah 
it was really boring 
it was really boring 
um 
my dad was just getting himself settled into the community and and 
with his job and everything my mom stayed home so 
she stayed with us for a while 
um 
most of my 
early childhood memories are from where 
where we lived in mansfield 
it was uh 
it was a real 
it was a real 
don't talk don't ask community 
mean you really didn't know your neighbors unless you went over and 
said hi they never came over 
so 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah we lived in a suburban area 
of mansfield 
sort of like the 
uh the 
the white collar 
area where 
all the people 
who were 
business men were getting themselves established 
so and then 
um 
we switched churches 
and 
also my dad opened up he he and his partner opened up another 
uh branch office 
in ashland 
so we moved to the ashland area 
about 
about eight years ago almost nine years ago 
and we moved to ashland 
to get half way between 
um 
dad is my dad's not centrally located between the ashland office 
the  
hospital that's in ashland the hospitals that are in mansfield 
he's about he said it's about a twenty minute drive from all the places he needs to be 
um actually yeah we live on an we live on an 
now we live on an eighty acre farm 
yeah 
we've gotten a nice big house a barn some tractors no animals well we've got a dog but 
but um 
it's it's 
a farm in the sense that we've got a barn we've got tractors we lease 
we lease some of the land out 
to a a farmer who who 
actually works in 
plants stuff 
no 
not to be on a farm no my dad's a doctor 
i 
all that 
all that that's what he does he's not real interested in farming although his major pastime 
is going out on his tractor and mowing lawn and then doing other miscellaneous things he really likes his tractors 
his tractors 
but uh 
and he was raised he was raised in suburbia so 
the  
the tractor thing's a whole new thing for him so he's 
you know he really 
he 
it 
he's from rochester new york 
yeah 
my mom's from akron 
yeah 
um 
actually 
uh one of my dad's really good friends 
went to the same church denomination that my mom did 
and 
my dad went with 
his friend at 
to a summer camp that they had and that's where they actually first met 
and my dad was extremely taken with her 
and decided to pursue the matter to the extent of marriage 
so 
that's where they met 
no uhhuh i i come down here two or three times like 
you know just trips through going to the airport and other miscellaneous things 
but um when i moved to the city i mean 
it it was a real big change because i've 
you know used to living in the country 
and i move into smack dab in the middle of a 
downtown 
area 
yeah 
yeah 
lived in the dorms my freshman year and then i moved into a house with a bunch of 
guys i met 
yeah so 
what was different 
um 
one the things that i really enjoyed that was different is the traffic 
and that really no that really that really became 
really became uh 
interesting and different for me when i started working for a courier service 
winter quarter 
i took off 
i took all classes off winter quarter and worked for a courier service 
because i needed some money 
and i love driving 
and let me tell you it's really really different driving around in the big city compared to out in the country man 
i mean you're flying down seventy one or seventy through town and you go as fast as everybody else is going and if they're going eighty you're going eighty 
and if they're going two you're going two 
yeah i mean my dad 
i brought him down to columbus few times 
because my dad and i are real close and um 
i'm driving around 
i was zipping between cars and he's like 
i forgot what it's like living in a city because he used to live in chicago 
but um it that's one of the things i really enjoy 
one of things i don't like 
about living the big city is 
is like 
but i've gotten used to 
but i uh 
i don't like the fact that 
every time 
you look up in the night sky and all you see is this 
like 
orange haze 
you can't see stars very well 
uh the noise i mean there's 
always noise 
i remember last year living in the dorms 
every morning at two thirty in the morning 
there was the trash truck that picked up some trash 
from 
a bar right behind where we lived and 
i lived in taylor so 
it's this 
it's it's in a t shape and then the side of the building 
all the sound just rolls right up the wall 
and 
this trash truck made so much stinking noise 
it's ridiculous 
every single morning at two thirty 
yeah i didn't 
i 
i developed uh 
i developed the the the ability to sleep through anything 
which is 
and that's that's so one of the fascinating things when i go home 
dead silence 
dead 
silence 
and that 
is now where i have a problem sleeping 
because it's because there's no noise 
there's no noise i'm so used to like turning my radio on and drowning out all the background sound 
that i hafta like have music on in the 
so 
in that down here 
uhhum 
yeah 
i really like the city 
i like the night life 
everything in 
in ashland mansfield shuts down at nine thirty ten o'clock 
and it all starts up at nine thirty ten o'clock here in columbus 
and that's so cool i love it man 
i love going out clubbing at like two o'clock in the morning 
um 
red zone 
red zone we usually they open up a nine or ten o'clock depending on if they got a special show coming in or not 
but that's the place i really like going 
um 
they uh 
they're open till usually two thirty 
two o'clock 
all depends 
um 
i also found something fascinating 
um 
i uh 
came to columbus and 
you know raised in this really really really conservative extremely christian religious community of ashland 
and i came to columbus and i started meeting 
you know i started meeting the extremely taboo group of homosexuals 
and i have found some the most fascinating people on this planet are homosexuals 
um 
and they're not nearly the they're not the the the 
evil people that that everybody back home in our community always said they were you know it's just like these are normal people 
you know i may not agree with what they're doing but 
they're normal people 
and i've met some really cool people 
who are 
who are homosexuals and that leading 
where that was going was um 
we went to axis which is 
uh one of the home 
well 
it's one of the gay um 
uh dance clubs in columbus 
it's um 
it's on high street 
it's down in uh 
it's down in the german  
no it's not all the way 
is it the 
short north 
it's in the short north 
but um 
it's so much fun 
it's absolutely so much fun because 
it's really weird 
um 
you normally don't get hit on by girls 
when you go to a regular dance club 
but when you go to axis you don't get hit on by girls you get hit on by guys 
i danced with glow sticks and i've had i had like seven guys come up to me in one night and they're just like can can you like 
can you do that for me  
because apparently they 
apparently they get really fascinated by 
the fact that the lights are moving around right in front of them so i do that for i do it right in front of their face and they'd be like dude that  
and apparently that's a way of  a conversation 
um one of the guys that i usually go clubbing with he's the one that got me into the glow stick dancing and he said uh 
he said it's like a sign that says  hit on me and i'm like oh great that's that's just what i need 
no it doesn't bother me 
doesn't bother me 
i just 
i just 
i sort of just i'm just like not you know i'm straight 
if they start 
if they start getting really 
you know really pushy about it i'm just like i'm straight 
but a lot of times it's really funny because i will get in a conversation with m and they will be like 
you're straight aren't you 
i'm like yeah 
they will 
yeah they 
i don't know how but they must 
they 
it's just being 
i must guess it must be the way i talk or 
or or something but 
i think i keep a lot of them away because i do a lot of really 
i do a lot of really robust movements 
with my glow sticks i'm like flailing about and 
you know it's like this 
i got this wide berth around me 
yeah it's it's not one of these it's one of these and 
yeah it's 
yeah 
uhhum 
hum 
yeah 
yeah 
i guess i'm just so secure about who i am that i don't have a problem with it 
and i was in the men's glee club for a while so 
there's a small percentage of the people in there that are 
you know that  
that are gay as well and that's and and 
i really made friends with a lot of them 
i guess uh i mean 
i guess it's just because of my personality i i  i really don't know what it is but apparently something in my personality calls out to them and says come hey 
you can be my friend i'm cool 
i'm all right even though i'm not even though i'm not one of you i can still be your friend 
which is sort of what i try and emanate because i'm i'm very very religious 
and it's 
the 
christian community is very 
is 
i'm not gonna say can be i say they 
are 
christian community is very very mean towards 
homosexuals 
and  
that's just not right i mean they're people 
they're making a mistake in in my eyes yes but that doesn't mean i'm going look at them any differently 
as human beings 
they deserve my respect 
oh yeah but i see everyone as engaging in sinful behavior because 
in my in my religion everyone sins 
um 
i'm a 
i'm a christian i go to a non denominational church 
yeah 
i don't like denominations 
i'm not 
i'm not real big on the denominations because i think that 
i think that's sort of goes against 
what the original intent of of 
christianity 
was i 
i mean 
it was designed to be a unifying 
religion 
and the denominations there are just 
are are just 
yeah but if 
i don't like them 
uhhum 
uhhum 
yeah 
uhhum 
yep 
not really i mean 
i have i 
i 
there's theological differences that i have 
um 
without going into too much detail 
um 
one of my best friends from high school 
well he stayed at home 
and i went off to columbus and i found an amazing church down here and learned 
a lot 
and 
and 
really stumbled across a lot of interesting doctrine 
and theological beliefs and 
i believe that stuff now 
and he doesn't 
and he feels actually strongly that 
anyone who believes that is like 
a heretic 
and 
he just went off to alaska with another friend of ours 
and before he left for alaska i actually 
took the time to to uh 
i didn't want to 
but 
he was sort of pushing me into it 
because we were 
im-ing each other 
and uh 
he sort of pushed me into it a little bit and 
i told him 
you know i'm like 
a lot of the stuff that you have talked about 
uh you know 
talked about not liking i believe 
and i  
and i told him i said i can 
i can understand 
if 
in our minds there's a problem 
but we accept the fact that the other person is wrong and leave it at that 
but that's not what you're thinking you're thinking you're looking at me and you're knowing 
within your mind he's evil he's wrong 
and i said that's not right dude 
i 
i honestly don't know 
uh people get really scared 
there's certain i mean like  
there's certain denominations that will take one 
it's sort of like the outer limits they will take one 
book 
or one scripture 
out of the bible 
and expand it to crystal 
clarity 
and 
they will just run with it 
and that's what my mom came out of 
um 
her 
her denomination that she came out of she's not part of it any more 
denomination she came out of it 
um 
some of the more 
devout 
churches within the apostolic christian church 
we're talking men sit on one side women sit on the other women wear little thingies on their heads no jewelry 
the 
sermon is read in three different languages 
some really wacky stuff 
i mean some really wacky 
they will just take one scripture and they will expand it 
um 
and and they will just 
run with that one scripture 
and then there are also churches that will just 
deletes and they will  
in the 
in  in their minds they will delete certain sections of the scripture that they don't like 
first corinthians chapter twelve talks about 
um spiritual gifts 
and that's one of the big things that i'm into 
down here in columbus and the fact that they still exist 
like 
healing people and 
spiritual gifts like healing people and and um 
the extremely taboo 
um religious topic 
among 
a lot of churches is the gift of tongues 
whether it's dead whether it's not 
whether it's inspired whether it's not inspired 
yadda yadda blah blah 
well 
i hadn't even heard about it until i got to columbus because 
and and i know the bible pretty well 
and 
i hadn't even heard about it until i got to columbus and i get to columbus and i'm like 
okay this is pretty cool 
i went home and i'm talking to some people in my parents' church and 
they're like 
oh yeah 
um we just don't really talk about that very often and i'm just 
why i mean it's part of the scripture that you say you believe in a hundred percent then why don't you 
why don't you talk about it 
and the problem is that 
they don't 
they don't know the answer 
and if they don't know the answer if they can't give a firm 
this is the answer then they avoid it 
try and find it 
i try and find 
for me 
what has become the best answer 
you know if i don't 
if i don't  
if i don't believe something or i don't know 
what to believe about something 
i will go and i will find an answer for myself 
i'm not gonna take somebody else's answer 
and if i do take someone else's answer they better be able to back it up 
you know 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
well i know a lot of people that do 
but i know a lot of people that don't 
uhhum 
uhhum 
um do the theological discussions no 
no unless 
unless you're seeking that out i mean 
i go to the vineyard church it's up in it's up in uh 
um westerville 
and there's about 
there's about probably six thousand of us 
it's one the biggest churches in ohio 
and um 
but if you want to find something in that church you can find it you can find a discussion group about anything 
it's just a matter of finding it 
and 
within any 
within any  
denomination or within any religion 
you go as deep as you want to go 
you know there are people that'd just go on sunday mornings there are people who just go on easter there are people who 
go monday wednesday tuesday 
and then sunday nights and saturday nights and 
are very very very 
into that 
and i mean 
i'm not the monday tuesday wednesday thursday type 
but i am pretty involved 
i'm pretty involved 
uhhum 
the community 
the community 
um the church is designed as a community of other christians 
it's not necessarily designed as 
um 
i heard this in a sermon this is really good 
um it's not designed as the congregation comes in and says way to go pastor you go do it we're gonna cheer you on 
the job of a christian is to go out and spread the gospel of jesus christ 
that's the job 
of a christian 
and 
there are a lot of churches who have totally forgotten 
that that's what the original 
you know that's what the that's what a christian's supposed to do 
and that's what our church does 

we try and 
you know we try and 
and teach and 
expand people's knowledge so that when they go out and they talk to someone about christ 
they don't have 
you know they don't have that blank look on their face when the person asks them something 
you know they 
somebody asks them something and they're like you know 
i don't know 
or they 
actually have an answer 
you know 
if 
and if they don't know they will say 
i don't know but i can find out for you if you're willing to 
if you're willing to give me the time to go find out 
i don't know the hardest 
um 
some of the really hard questions 
um why do bad things happen to good people 
people can't  people can't just accept that 
that 
bad things happen to good people they want to know why 
i don't know why 
i'm not i  
i mean yeah i have a personal relationship with my 
with my god but we're not on you know we're not on a conversational i'm on this side of the table you're on that side the table why did this happen 
and he doesn't 
he doesn't see fit to tell me why something happens 
unless it pertains to me 
um 
let's see what's another really hard one 
um 
one of the biggest ones with people 
my age 
is the  
is um 
apologetics 
uh  
apologetics which is 
going out and saying 
you're a sinner 
accept christ 
everybody on this campus has heard of brother jedd 
he runs around on  he runs around on the oval going you know slut whore 
yadda yadda yadda 
and that's just 
i mean there are a lot of 
there are a lot of people within the community of 
of christians who 
can't stand that 
we don't like what he's doing 
because 
yeah i'm one of them because 
we have to go back 
anyone who has been influenced by him we have to go back and we have to 
undo all the damage he's done before we can really start in on them 
and and 
and helping them to understand what we're trying to tell them 
we have to undo what brother jedd has done because 
he's just 
i mean yeah maybe his heart's 
in the right place but he's doing it the wrong way 
but um 
one of the big 
things 
is 
right after you're done  
doing all of the 
spiel about you know why you think they should  
accept christ 
in their life they say okay that's good for you 
and that's 
the general 
that's the general feeling among people our age 
our generation 
i mean 
i mean what generation are we anyways 
i'm i'm  i'm twenty 
so there's like 
the generation 
x they're the generation 
right 
after me and there's generation y two k they're generation right before me so we're stuck right in the middle 
don't even think we have a generation 
just one big 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
i don't feel that i 
i don't feel i i don't feel like i fit in with the teenagers anymore either 
uhhum 
yeah 
can't really take her with you 
yeah you can't get her in 
you can't get her in 
have to be eighteen to get into dance clubs now 
but um 
that's uh 
those are the two really really really tough ones that 
a lot of people will 
uh will will throw at you when you're when you're trying to share things with them 
but there's 
i mean there's whole there's whole lists of them 
and uh 
it's just a matter of 
i mean 
i 
i don't  
i am 
getting myself to a point where i can go out 
and share my faith with other people 
i don't think i'm ready to 
um 
because 
one of the biggest problems is like i mentioned with 
with the brother jedd thing 
is 
undoing the damage other people have done 
and 
i don't have enough knowledge 
up here 
to really go out 
and 
and you know 
to go out and be like a campus preacher 
i mean 
i will tell 
i will share my faith with people that i'm really close to 
that like 
you know coemployees and other 
and other thing and other people that i'm in like 
if somebody and i 
if somebody gets real close to me in a class you know eventually i will share 
and eventually i will share with them but 
like if i'm in a lecture hall i'm not gonna jump up and start hollering about my faith 
um 
and 
and i won't 
i won't walk into a coffee shop like a lot of my friends will and sit down and start talking to people 
i don't feel i'm ready to do that yet 
i think there are  i think there's a place and a time 
for doing certain things 
like um 
and this is 
this is one of the biggest um 
things that people use as 
as a reason for 
faith 
faith 
is something that people don't understand 
i don't even understand it 
i use it as 
i use it as an answer for a lot of questions that i don't have 
answers for 
is faith 
and that's what religion is religion is faith 
every religion has 
hasta have faith you hafta believe that what you're doing and what you're believing in is right 
you know 
whether 
everyone else in the world thinks it is or not you hafta believe it is 
or 
you being 
or you being part of that religion has 
absolutely no meaning 
and 
that's an answer that a lot of people don't like to hear 
and 
you know like 
um 
i've walked down 
like high street before 
and gotten this 
urge this feeling to just share my faith with certain people on the  
on the sidewalks 
like i share 
i shared my faith  uh 
a little while ago with 
some street bums 
and 
they were real receptive 
and i don't know if they were drunk 
but they were real receptive 
i mean i i don't know if they really understood what i was saying but 
i felt 
led to talk to them 
and that's what i believe my faith is my faith is 
is faith 
it's 
believing that 
things happen that you can't explain 
and there's 
it's 
believing that uh you're doing 
what you're doing is right 
so 
religion's a real big part of my life 
i knew we 
i knew we wouldn't go into this  too far before this 
before it came in 
uhhum 
yeah 
it has 
it has 
yeah 
exactly what you said 
i mean 
my dad 
my whole family are christians and before i left for college my freshman year my dad 
my dad knows me real well mainly because i'm doing almost a mirror image of what he did when he grew up 
uh 
aside from 
the faith that i have 
um i'm very much like him 
um 
he wrote out a list of seven things  predictions for william's freshman year 
and every single one of them was accurate 
it was really really really funny 
william will lose something expensive by the end of the year and 
had my bike stolen 
william will 
william will 
and the big one that i 
was gonna mention was 
william will either grow in his faith significantly 
or will go the exact opposite direction 
and 
i knew one or the other would happen because i'm the  
i mean 
my roommate 
my freshman year for the first quarter was a drug dealer 
oh yeah it was real fun 
real fun i discreetly got him kicked out of the dorm 
he still doesn't know it was me 
but 
yeah 
he still doesn't know it was me but he and i are still on speaking terms which is 
which is 
fascinating 
um 
but uh 
you know i mean 
our first day 
i walked in 
he said hey i'm tom you ever smoked pot before 
i was like 
no 
he said heck we got a whole year together 
and 
and i'm directly quoting that this the first thing he said to me 
that is the first thing he said to me 
no no he's not but um 
he 
and i 
uh he and i hung out a lot and 
you know 
i 
knew that one of two things was going happen i was gonna follow him 
and start doing all sorts of interesting and wrong things within my own mind doing them 
every time i doing 
every time i would have done them i would have known they were wrong 
or i was going to the opposite direction 
and i went the opposite direction i got plugged in with uh the 
some christian groups on campus made some 
christian friends and 
hung out with them and and 
grew a lot 
grew a lot in acceptance of other people 
i mean 
you don't really run into homosexuals in a small rural 
christian community 
and if you do they 
if you do you don't know it because they will  shunned out of the community so fast that 
it's crazy 
but uh 
um 
where was i going with that 
okay 

yeah 
it was because i got 
it was because i got into a different 
i mean 
i had grown up 
with these people 
you know i hung out with all these people that were part of my youth group and 
and i hung out with them and hung out with them and 
and 
i came to columbus and met a whole new group of people 
mean every year i've been down here i've met another 
you know 
thousand people 
and they're all different 
every year they're 
all different people 
and that didn't happen back home i keep meeting people and it's just really fascinating 
yeah 
this is 
endless flow of people and you're like wow 
and man there get some weird looking people down here 
man there's some good looking chicks down here in columbus 
let me tell you 
um yeah my freshman year i went out with uh someone her name was  
she 
um 
she's the one who really got me into the uh 
what we call charismatic 
um 
christianity 
the christianity uh 
you know like 
the opposite of charismatic 
is 
the um 
the serious 
old time protestant church 
where they put numbers up on the wall and you open up your hymnal to those numbers you sing 
you stand up when everyone tells you stand up you sit down when everyone tells you to sit down 
yadda yadda 
and then 
the 
protestant 
the uh sorry the um 
charismatic is the exact opposite of that 
when you think of charismatic you think of the black churches 
where there's 
all sorts of 
organ playing and 
you know praise the  and hands in the air and singing and dancing and 
people falling over and 
and she's she really introduced me to that 
um 
and then we dated for about three months 
and 
i 
both of us decided okay 
this is 
we accomplished what we 
were supposed to accomplish in this relationship you've introduced me to something and i've introduced you to something and 
now we're gonna go our separate ways and so 
we separated 
and then 
i found my current church 
and 
got plugged in there and i met someone there 
um 
in 
january 
of this year 
we dated for two months 
and then i got really tired of the fact that within two weeks of knowing me and dating me she said 
william you're the person i'm gonna marry 
and that 
flipped me out 
that flipped me out man 
i couldn't handle that that 
i'm not ready for that i mean that was crazy she was twenty three first person i've ever dated that's older than me 
and uh that was just frightening i mean she was like 
dead serious she was a hundred percent sure 
i was the person she was going to marry 
and i will see her at church every so often and she will come up and give me a big hug she's like i miss you 
i'm like 
well i miss you too not probably the way you miss me but i miss 
i miss you you know 
um yeah if she's a  no 
no no no no no i mean she's a  she's a great person she's a good christian but there's some things about her that i would not want in a wife 
ixnay on that 
but um 
been single since 
uh 
probably 
march 
and i'm probably gonna stay that way for a while mainly because i don't like anybody nobody likes me i like it that way 
i don't 
i don't have money and 
when i start dating people i have  
i have extremely expensive tastes 
for women 
and 
i like wine and dining people 
i love the opera 
and that gets real  a while 
gets real expensive after a while 
uh i'm taking one class 
i'm taking uh an accounting class 
i had a real big mess 
academically 
um 
graduated high school with three five it was all college prep classes a p courses 
i got a really high i q extremely intelligent all through high school i was just coasting on that intellect 
i'd go in take an exam 
bing bang 
go out get an a 
wouldn't even study for it i think i studied as much my senior year as i did my 
freshman year for one midterm 
or 
or one final 
and uh that just didn't work when i got to college 
but i didn't know that until i was done with my freshman year with a one point seven g p a 
about uh 
about 
see the middle of winter quarter i realized why 
i was in engineering 
i had applied  
three colleges 
my senior year of high school 
ohio state 
on a whim from my dad who told me to apply there because 
i could get in 
without any trouble whatsoever 
naval academy and the air force academy 
now 
naval academy air force academy and west point 
are three of the top  
ten hardest schools in the world to get into 
you get into one of those academies and you're coming out as an engineer 
that's what they all are 
i mean yeah there's other 
there's other field but the vast majority are engineers 
i like math and science 
so i figure oh 
engineering i don't have any other options i must be engineering 
so i came to college and i got into the 
honors engineering 
freshman freshman  
honors 
engineering program 
called the gateway program 
engineering 
is the 
hardest 
field 
to study 
aside probably from law or medicine 
and 
i went into the 
honors program 
that was a big mistake 
really really big mistake i got to college and it just went downhill 
i had all that freedom and 
i had no clue how to study 
and it just went to hell in a hand basket 
summer 
um  spring quarter 
i switched my major to music 
because 
i'm extremely musically inclined it's one of the gifts that i've gotten 
and um 
that uh 
that i discovered is very similar to acting which i love to do but i realized that just like acting 
you 
are 
all good 
ninety five percent of you are poor as dirt 
three percent of you 
are right in the middle and two percent of you are extremely wealthy 
and the vast majority like i said ninety five percent are dirt poor you know i don't want to do that 
i mean i 
i my dad's a doctor i was raised in high society i don't want to leave high society 
i like it there 
i like it there a lot 
yeah 
and um 
so i was like 
i better get out of 
better get out of the music thing 
so i decided to go into business 
but um 
i can't get into business 
until 
i get a  a bunch prerequisite courses 
out of the way because my g p a is  
it's 
i 
in 
after  
this quarter i did really good this quarter 
after this quarter it's up to a two two 
and 
i'm not gonna be able to 
get into the business school until i've got a bunch prerequisites out of the way 
and they're sequences 
i can't take accounting two twelve until i'm done with two eleven i can't take 
c i s two hundred and two o one until i'm done with two hundred 
and all that 
junk so 
i had to take this stupid class this summer because 
if i'm gonna get in when i want to 
um 
i have 
you know i hafta take it this summer 
i hate taking classes in summer 
when i'm 
well because 
i'd rather just 
i'd rather just 
work 
and and not worry about the classes and then have all sorts of fun all summer long with all my friends 
but it's not gonna work 
yeah 
rest my brain a little bit 
but i'm still searching for a job 
it's not that i can't find jobs it's just that i can't find the one i want 
i mean the job market is huge down here in columbus 
i mean i want a job right around nine ten dollars an hour 
so i can get a full forty hour week 
and they won't have a problem with me leaving at five o'clock because i have a class at five thirty 
but that's what i'm doing this summer 
i'm still searching for a job 
i would've 
i would've done some more searching today but i've had a few problems with my satanic computer 
stupid 
i swear it's possessed 
i 
i 
if i could figure out how to work 
f disk 
and format 
in dos 
i might be able to figure out what my problem is 
because i've started running two 
i started running windows two thousand 
about three months ago 
that was a dumb mistake 
one of the guys in my house is software  
and he got me a copy of two thousand he was like 
your computer will run two thousand let's put it on your computer so i was 
i was like 
okay 
alright what are the advantages and he's like dude let's just put on your computer so i'm like alright fine 
i don't care 
so we put it on my computer and i've had nothing but problems since 
i don't know how anyone can run two thousand if they don't know what they're doing i'm trying to find drivers 
because i've had to find 
i've had to find 
drivers for everything 
i mean they don't 
oh yeah 
and also it's 
directed towards businesses 
it's 
n t technology which is 
for network businesses and 
well anyways 
it's got a different file structure format than windows ninety 
eight 
it runs 
it runs on 
n t s f 
and fat thirty two 
and 
i hafta switch it back 
to fat sixteen 
and 
i can't get the partitioning right 
for my  
for my drive because fat sixteen can't handle anything above two gigs for the primary drive 
and my drive is ten gig drive so i hafta partition it 
and i can't figure out how to get silly thing partitioned 
because every time i try and work around it and make partition through f disk 
i get these really wacky 
errors 
everything gets transferred over to d drive 
and i have no more c drive 
it's gone 
i don't know where it vanishes to 
so 
it's 
it is 
no and i can't do a stinking thing on my computer 
i hafta use all the other guys' computers in my house 

yeah 
true 
yes 
um no actually my roommate's in colorado right now 
and he's going to he's 
he's gonna be there 
he's gonna 
he's gonna be there all summer 
you know i didn't decide i wanted to change it over until i got my scanner 
um 
and found out that when i checked the web site 
for the scanner 
that 
they're just simply flat out not making 
windows two thousand drivers for my scanner 
so 
it's a um 
crap 
i don't know 
i just got it 
i can't even remember what it is 
um 
paper port 
i think it's paper port 
avoid windows two thousand at all costs 
stick with ninety eight 
much better 
much better operating system 
that's a good system 
it's really fascinating too because i called microsoft 
and it was gonna cost me thirty five dollars for technical support 
i was like screw that 
i was like screw that dude 
figure out how to do it myself 
so i got on some my news groups and i'm like guys can you help me 
oh no it's not that i hate microsoft it's you know i mean 
they hafta do what they hafta do 
i mean 
people  
people don't understand that software hasta stay 
up to date 
on the minute 
or they get sucked under 
mean there are 
there are operating systems that people haven't even heard of 
that were the 
thing 
in their days 
i mean 
a lot of people know what a commodore sixty four is 
they've heard of it 
but 
they really don't know 
what a brilliant system it was at it's uh in in it's 
initial stage 
and 
it just got bowled over because 
you know something better came out 
something better will come out than windows 
microsoft will eventually go under 
it's just gonna take a while 
uh yeah 
oh yeah i don't 
i give it probably about six or seven years before 
for before somebody comes out with a system that's just as good as microsoft 
linux uh i don't know 
i think linux will be around forever 
just because it's such a stable system that's so good 
and 
yeah 
and macintosh will stay around forever just because macintosh is invincible 
uhhum 
uhhum 
after the big hype of the i mac and it didn't do as good as it nearly as good as they thought it was gonna do 
even if did okay it's still around 
it just didn't do as good as i thought it was gonna do 
dumb morons what 
idiot doesn't put a three and a half drive on a computer that was stupid 
that was just dumb marketing 
that was dumb marketing 
uhhum 
yeah 
uhhum 
yeah 
it was really funny when i did talk to microsoft they're like did you call your 
manufacturer and i'm like well 
probably wouldn't do any good because there's not a whole lot left in my computer that's manufacturer 
mean i got a micron 
i  
i  
bought the computer from micron 
and um 
my 
mother board 
sound card 
video card 
all my network cards 
the case 
the only thing 
anymore 
that is original 
is the hard drive 
the c d rom 
the three and a half 
the 
hundred twenty eight meg 
ram chip 
and 
the c p u 
that's the only thing that's 
factory anymore 
no they probably wouldn't 
i don't know 
i don't know 
i'm a really good businessman my dad and i have been screwing around with stocks for years 
um  been in contact with a 
um day trading firm down in west virginia 
and they're starting an intern program sometime i don't even know when 
but 
if they 
if that opens up i will 
probably seriously consider going down to west virginia 
they're in richmond west virginia richmond 
yeah 
i've been saying west virginia haven't i 
they're in virginia sorry 
their 
home base is in  um richmond virginia 
is there a richmond in virginia 
okay 
their home base is in richmond virginia 
and um 
if they open up the intern program like i'm hoping they will 
then i will go down there 
and join the intern program because 
i would love to learn how to day trade 
i've always been good with stocks 
always been good with them 
but where am i going in the future 
i don't know 
i know eventually i'm going to go back to law school and get a law degree 
because i did 
i did mock trial in high school 
and 
i love it 
i love law 
absolutely love law 
i'm good at it 
i had um 
one of the 
lawyers that was being our judges at state 
um 
came up afterwards and gave me his business card and said if 
and when you get through law school give me a call 
i was like 
kick 
man 
dude 
keep that card 
make a phone call maybe you will be like a maybe you will be like a you know full time partner when i 
when i get out 
i don't know 
trial stuff i also wouldn't mind doing 
um since i will have a business degree i wouldn't mind doing uh 
um 
some sort of financial laws 
stuff 
and like 
being uh uh 
a lawyer for 
somebody who wants to 
sue the crap out of another corporation 
no plenty of money in that 
i don't want to be an  
i don't want to be an ambulance chaser i just want to be 
want be somebody who helps screw all the big giants 
well yeah 
yeah 
one giant wants beat the crap out of the other giant 
uhhum 
impressions of columbus 
well number one i didn't realize that it was as big as it is until i started working for the courier service 
you know i've heard people say 
and i know it's true that columbus is 
one of the top ten largest cities in the united states 
and i was like 
you're kidding me 
really 
i started driving around and i'm like yeah it is 
this place is huge 
this place is absolutely behemoth 
i mean 
everything within two seventy 
it's it's pretty darn big 
and um 
that was really surprising 
um 
i love 
i just love living in a big city uh 
i it's just 
it's just 
everything is so different than living in the country 
i mean 
i miss the big expanses of grass out in the country 
but 
i can skate all over the place 
here 
in town 
which i can't do at home 
i mean i can skate on our driveway but 
it stops abruptly and 
in stones 
so it gets real boring i mean going down hill is really fun but going back ups pain in the neck 
but um 
uh 
there's a lot more people here 
i  
i like lots of people 
i've discovered 
i like having lots people around meeting all sorts of new and interesting  unique people and 
every year there's a whole new crowd of freshmen that come in and 
it it's pretty cool 
yep 
it's enjoyable 
i like it 
i don't know if i will stay here 
i know i wouldn't raise a family here 
but 
no 
i mean 
ashland is the perfect place to raise family 
yep but that's about it 
and i mean 
i don't even know how any of the 
ashland has 
ashland university 
it's 
one of the it's got one of the best theological seminaries in the u s 
and it's a republican   
tink thank 
republican think tank 
so 
aside from the college the town is pretty much agricultural 
i don't know why 
i don't know why anybody would want to live there unless they're raising a family 
because if they're raising a family it's a great place 
great community 
it's just great all around for raising a family 
no 
i want to find a 
i want to find some place similar to that i want to find some place  that 
in colorado 
yeah i love colorado 
beautiful state 
it's got some good skiing 
yeah 
skating skiing 
that's how i did this 
tore my a c l 
two years ago christmas 
day after christmas 
it's um 
tendon that 
it's a 
tendon right 
uh right in the front of your knee 
that keeps 
yeah that it keeps your it keeps it keeps your knee from 
moving out 
and doing all sorts of other miscellaneous twisting and turning position that it's not really supposed to 
but i 
ripped that 
right in half 
well what i'd do and improve columbus 
well for one this place is dirty 
with crap 
it's 
it's just so 
it's so dirty i wish they'd clean it up more 
um 
uh 
when i first started working for the courier service 
i really really hated one way streets 
but once you get the hang of it 
they're a blessing 
because you're in downtown and all of a sudden ding ding ding ding ding ding ding you see like twelve green lights in a row 
you're just like 
you go as fast as you can and try and get through 
all of them all at the same time 
now mind you if you're doing that anytime during the day that won't happen because you've got cars all around you but at night it's pretty fun and you just floor it and fly right through the middle of down town 
um 
improvements 
i would just say keep i would just say that man this place is dirty 
yeah 
i wish they'd clean it up more often 
no 
it's not sprawling out from where i am 
i don't live in the suburbia 
area so 
i mean i live 
i live right in the middle of all the 
houses that have been there for sixty or seventy years and i'm smack dab in the middle of all the frats and sororities on campus 
so 
i'm on 
nah 
that's fine 
spreads out fine 
i just think it's funny 
i 
i'd love to get a good nice 
overhead view of columbus because you probably see the 
house after house after house um 
you know like 
they did right in the right in the 
um fifties 
uh i can't remember what it's called 
like where 
every single house is a mirror image of the one right beside it 
and you get all these streets that are in the exact same pattern all you know like for like miles and miles and miles 
but um 
no 
i think it's cool that they're all spreading out 
oh yeah one thing they could really do with columbus that i've noticed 
are 
i would say lack of noticed in any other city in the united states 
why in the world do they hafta work on 
all the roads 
all at the same time 
i don't understand 
they hafta to they're working on three fifteen two seventy seventy seventy one six seventy 
all at the same time 
why 
why 
i don't understand it 
yeah 
apparently not 
not really 

yeah as i was teasing 
okay 
twenty eight years 
this is my twenty eighth year 
i have two more years to go 
and i get to  
and then i will go 
retrain and probably do something else for another twenty years 
oh no 
no they move you around all the time when you  when you teach kids with learning disabilities 
they move you to where the population is 
rather than move the kids to you 
so yeah i've been in 
columbus 
and worthington are the two systems i've been in but 
no though within those 
they can move you around from school to school 
i've been at the same one now for 
this is my seventh year 
at the middle school 
it's grace brethren christian middle school it's part of worthington schools cause they annexed 
it 
i was in columbus for the first like six years i taught 
back in the  
early seventies 
and then i transferred to worthington in seventy six and i've been there ever since 
no i didn't really start out as 
a teacher i started out as a speech and hearing therapist 
but they kept giving me these kids that 
i couldn't keep them in the chair long enough to do the speech therapy with them 
so i got interested in the hyper activity and so i started taking classes 
about any 
kids with 
a d h d and stuff and 
little by little first thing you know 
i had my masters in learning disabilities 
it was mostly just so i could 
learn how to keep the kids in their seat long enough to do the speech therapy and then when i found out there were so many openings in special ed 
so and then i found out later that speech therapy is a very good background 
for l d because 
a lot of these l d kids have language deficits and language problems they 
they can't you know like express themselves on paper 
or they don't 
process things correctly 
auditorially so 
it's the perfect background 
to work with l d kids 
i didn't know i was doing that at the time but 
somebody must have been watching over me 
yeah 
yeah right i taught 
um 
well i was a speech therapist probably five or six years and then ever since that i've 
been in 
uhhuh 
and then when i got my masters 
no i did it 
no i did it 
during 
the weekends 
summers 
and the nights 
and took me about 
mm 
well i started teaching in nineteen seventy 
seventy one 
and then  i 
got my masters in seventy five 
so it took me four years that way 
no i never 
i just  
was smart enough to do it before i had kids 
well i was married but i didn't have any kids once  have kids  not gonna be able to do that kind of a schedule 
but um 
yeah so i didn't take off any time 
and then when i 
got my masters i ran into an old friend of mine 
who 
teaches in worthington and he 
said oh i'm the special ed director up there now we need a resource room 
why don't you come up and interview for this position 
or that position or 
when i went up and interviewed for that position got another position but anyway it all worked 
well i guess i'd have to say 
i 
don't necessarily like middle school 
but see when you get a special ed certificate you're certified kindergarten through twelfth 
so 
i did 
several years in a high school 
when i was first out of college 
i did high school first 
then i went to elementary while 
my kids were in elementary 
so i could kind of keep in touch with what they were supposed to be learning you know 
and then 
six years ago i went to the middle school 
and i've decided that 
i'm too old 
to keep up with these kids 
not only are they 
learning disability and a d d but they're middle schoolers 
and they have like hormones running rampant all over the outside of their bodies 
you can't tell which is the hormones and which is the a d d and which is the learning disability 
but 
like i said i only have two more years to go so i guess i can live through 
that's not my favorite age i guess 
middle 
oh yeah they were more settled 
oh they do in ninth grade and by tenth grade and eleventh they're 
little more focused on the fact that they better get their act together because they're gonna have to go to college and 
this is like 
the only life they're gonna get you know they kind of get that realization they start getting serious 
kids at middle school think everything's just a big joke you know i'm gonna play in a rock band 
you know they all think they're gonna be rock stars and drummers and 
and 
you know they could care less 
about anything it hasn't hit them yet this is my real life 
duh 
this is my one real life 
better not throw it away 
they waste time you know 
they 
stuff 
they think everything they say is hilarious oh it's just middle school i think it's 
transitioning from childhood 
to adulthood is a tough time 
and um 
when you have all the other 
things going on like you can't read and you can't write and you can't spell 
then it's just even worse   it's exacerbated even more 
so 
i get the ones that everybody else throws out of their class 
and they  
oh 
i don't really 
so i think of myself as kind of an impatient person but 
i guess i don't 
i guess i don't 
i don't get as shocked by some of the things they do as some people do and i don't 
yell and scream at them  i mean realize they didn't ask to have a learning disability 
i mean they and that they can't 
they're not some teachers think they're just being belligerent 
and that if they wanted to straighten up they could 
and what i try to tell those teachers is they can't change their learning disability anymore than you can change your brown eyes 
you know they were born with it it's genetic someone else in their family has it 
they can learn they just don't learn the same way everybody else does you have to break it down into pieces 
or teach it a different way it's like teaching a math problem two different ways you get the same answer 
but 
one way works better for you 
well that's how they are 
you know maybe they don't learn well by listening 
maybe they don't learn by  well by looking 
at a chart or something 
maybe they only learn well when they're up moving around doing something 
you know you just have to understand that their 
avenues of learning are like different than yours 
and totally 
some of them 
might be totally screwed up 
like they might hear 
half of what you say 
or they might jumble up what you say you say  
turn to page three ninety three or 
and they turn to three thirty nine in their book 
you know and they think they did what you said 
it's just like something's mixed up between 
the actual eye and the ear 
and then it where it gets interpreted into the brain it gets all scrambled somehow 
and i i always tell teachers if you could just walk 
uh 
for one day in their shoes 
you'd probably have a lot of empathy for them 
well 
actually in order to get in my room you have to 
be tested by the school psychologist and you have to qualify as a learning disability kid 
in other  
the way you qualify in the state of 
is 
you have a thirty point discrepancy between your actual i q 
and your daily performance in other words 
let's say you have a hundred i q 
but in all of your classes you're performing like a seventy i q person would 
so if there's a thirty point discrepancy in there 
and 
people see that you're bright 
but yet you're just not 
getting it 
you're not able to write answers 
like you could say 
or you're not able to read things 
that other seventh graders can read 
that kind of clues us in and then the 
regular ed or somebody refers the child for testing 
and then if they qualify 
for help 
then we 
you know they go to my room for certain classes most of my kids i have them for reading and english 
that's not a shocking surprise 
i mean i rarely get a kid for math although we do have kids that are 
learning disabled and they don't understand math either even though it's very concrete 
um
no   math is just 
you can say okay here's three blocks you can touch them 
one 
two three take two away now there's one 
i mean 
yeah you can't say a noun is always gonna be orange 
and it's gonna be slippery 
language is so much more abstract than math and science 
so the abstract areas like history and 
english and reading and literature that's where these kids have their problems 
because their 
disability is usually rooted in 
somewhere in the languages 
they either can't write can't read can't spell 
can't do all three 
or aren't very good at any of them 
once in a while you will see a good speller 
because he can remember the order in which the letters come 
but 
he might be a horrible reader and a horrible 
writer even though he can spell 
yeah and his comprehension 
of the words of other kids his age wouldn't be 
what it should be 
generally speaking my kids are two to four years behind 

and socially too 
i mean mostly a d h 
d and l d kids are emotionally immature as well 
so like the songs that their friends are listening to 
and their friends are maybe ready to think about girls and they're still 
acting like a fifth grader 
you know their not interested in girls and they're still listening to music that younger kids would like 
they're just 
generally socially they mature a little slower 
takes them longer to catch up 
attention deficit hyperactive disorder 
well 
actually 
you can have 
well they  usually go together some kids have learning disabilities without the 
a d h d and some have 
a d h d without the learning disability 
and some have both 
and you can have a d 
d without having the hyperactive part 
you can have 
attention deficit disorder 
with what they call hypo activity 
and that's the student 
that is kind of spacey and kind of dreamy 
and they never cause any trouble 
but they're kind of like out of touch with reality and they are always looking out the window 
and like they're the one that says i didn't hear what what was the question 
and uh 
they're 
they're a d d and they can't quite focus and  distract 
they can't screen out the distractions 
but 
because they're not hyper they're not always doing this and they're not bothering people 
they're kind of the 
they're the ones that usually get lost in the shuffle 
those are the kids that are real cooperative and they're always smiling they're kind of spaced out and daydreaming and 
and takes a long time to realize 
hey this kid 
can't focus 
but with the kid that's all over the place and doing a 
tapping this kids chair and the kid goes 
make him stop tapping my chair 
you can see right away that he can't focus because when you're he asks you for help and you come over to explain something to him and he's like 
all over the place while you're explaining he's not listening 
trying to show him something he won't look at it 
you know it's like 
people often say 
a d d kids 
can't focus 
or can't 
attend to anything 
but what's really happening 
is they attend to everything 
they can 
they just can't 
single out 
what i should attend to and what i should screen out 
so they attend to everything  equally 
the train going by out here the teacher talking up here 
the kid over here shuffling his papers 
this kid back 
up his pencil 
and so 
they get a little bit of everything and they don't learn anything 
you see 
oh 
or um 
if you read it 
to yourself out loud 
like if you're in a room by yourself and you read out loud do you remember it better 
than if you read 
silently 
if you hear yourself say the words 
well you have to um 
try some different things like put on headphones with music that doesn't have any words 
and try to read somewhere like 
yeah 
that blocks out 
all that 
uh  
extraneous stuff that's trying to pull you away 
yeah 
yeah and you don't want to listen to any  music with words because then you will start singing in the words and then you won't be able to read 
now how can you do that 
yeah 
and i have kids that say i do better when i listen to my music honest i do misses  please let me listen to my headphones 
but then they can't hear you when you say okay the time's up stop now or whatever 
you're going 
poke him 
so i don't usually let the kids listen to their headphones oh maybe the last week of school in june or something but 
or maybe right around christmas time but most of the time i don't 
because they get 
too 
out of touch with everything that's going on in the room 
and i don't have a like a regular size class like i will have five six seven kids at a time and believe me when you got seven hyper active 
in your room 
it's just like forty of any other kind it's plenty 
yeah 
oh there always has been 
there always has been i think a lot of people feel that kids 
a lot of kids are on medication today that shouldn't be 
but um 
i think that's the fault of the school or the parents 
or some doctor that like for example when we  kids in worthington to a doctor we have a list of three doctors that we work with 
and we know that they won't just give this kid a pill if he doesn't have 
eight out of the twelve symptoms or whatever 
so we refer them to those doctors and then 
if 
this  
those doctors are pretty conservative too and if they put them on meds it's usually just for the school day 
not during the summer not over vacation not after five o'clock 
not on the weekends 
and it's just to help them focus 
and then 
these doctors also ask for 
reports back from the teachers and if you don't see any appreciable difference 
in two or three weeks then you take the kid off and you try something else 
and some kids medication is like the difference between night and day you go back in observe the kid you can't believe it's the same kid 
other kids 
doesn't phase them they might as well be drinking a glass of water 
well 
since they have side effects like they stunt your growth and they 
subdue your appetite and some of the other 
you know some kids get headaches from dexadrine and aderal 
so i say you know if it works use it if it 
if it doesn't work just forget it 
but 
you know a lot of 
people feel that too many kids are on this stuff because 
there may be just 
not able to pay attention a little bit but they're not really a d d 
and the parents are taking them in and going 
johnnie's not getting straight a's put him on something 
so 
i guess 
yeah 
i think 
it's really 
you really have to be careful who you put on the medication and how much you put them on 
and how long they stay on it 
and 
and most kids don't like being on medication 
because it makes them different 
they don't look at it like 
gee i'm really lucky i live in a day and time when there is a pill to help me concentrate 
they look it like 
well none of my friends have to do it so why do i have to do it 
you know 
they look at it like it's a big pain because they gotta run over to the nurse and get their pill at lunch and 
generally 
the long acting they're time released ones there's only a couple of them 
a couple of the different medications that are out in the time release 
and they only work for about forty percent of population most people try the time release 
and it wears off and it doesn't 
do what it's supposed to so they go back to 
the six hour 
dosage you know one in the morning one at lunch 
and then their friends all know that they have to go get their pill and then they're late to the lunch line and 
you know they just hate it 
so 
but it isn't something they can 
a lot of kids 
will not 
i guess they're in 
denial just like 
we would be 
they say 
it doesn't help me i don't need it 
but when you sit down and say okay 
what are the things you're able to do when you're on it 
that you really have trouble with when you're off of it and they see it in black and white they go 
oh yeah 
i did get better grades last nine weeks didn't i 
wow isn't that amazing you were taking your pills then 
some connection here 
so you kind of just have to sit them down and and say well let's just go through some of the things that 
give you trouble and we will write them down and say 
oh well last nine weeks you did that without any problem at all 
this nine weeks 
you haven't been able to focus on that 
maybe 
does help you some 
maybe you just 
you know not giving it credit 
by the eighth grade they are 
sixth and seventh graders pretty much know everything 
and you're the stupid one 
but by the time they get to eighth grade they're going 
oh you're the best teacher i can't believe i 
said that to you 
or they 
yeah 
they come back to visit me sometimes from the high school 
three years 
i have them 
usually i have them sixth seventh and eighth 
for those 
language arts subjects 
unless they get 
some miraculous cure 
and they get 
phased out 
like right now i'm phasing a kid an eighth grader out and into the regular english 
but he worked really really hard 
and he's very bright 
and he's still a terrible speller 
but 
he 
is not lazy 
and he does his assignments 
and as long as you clearly 
explain to him what he's supposed to do and he's a good writer 
and  usually when he misspells something you can figure out what it says from the context 
you know so we're in the process of phasing him out 
so that he won't have to 
he's had help 
i think since he was in kindergarten 
that's the other thing that's really an enigma about these kids 
ninety percent of the time their i q is like a hundred and fifteen to a hundred and thirty 
and i mean they're very bright 
but yet 
something 
isn't 
connecting 
some wires are crossed up here or something 
and they're 
so they become very distrustful of adults because 
all their life people've been saying 

you're really smart 
no you're not dumb 
but they sit in class and they see their friends just catch on to things 
and that they can't do 
and so then they say 
well my parents are just saying that because they love me 
i'm really stupid 
you know 
and you have to actually ow them when they get to be this age that 
look you have a hundred and seventeen i q 
so that means you're a good problem solver you're a good logical 
thinker 
you're good in science you're good at math 
you know 
so there's a few things you're not good at 
doesn't mean you're stupid 
you know 
i'd much rather be stranded on an island with six 
l d kids than 
with six normal kids 
because l d kids would be creative and they would think of ways to get out of there 
and the normal kids would sit and cry 
you know 
oh yes they are 
well 
generally 
they have some area 
i don't think i've ever met the kid 
yet the 
kid 
who 
has no 
area 
that he doesn't excel in like 
once i had a 
sixth grade girl who 
still didn't know her time tables in sixth grade but she had a beverly sills opera voice 
and in every single school production she was the lead singer 
i had a girl once that won all kind of medals in gymnastics at the state level 
it seems like when god takes away from you he gives something back i've had kids who they 
got every badge you can get in boy scouts and 
you know i mean there's usually something that they're 
really 
it might not be related to school 
but there's usually something that they're really really good at in some other area 
like there's 
swimming or 
or scouting or whatever so 
they 
you know 
but generally speaking they will attack a problem 
a totally different way than the norm 
and they will come up with 
much more creative solutions 
than the normal 
person with a hundred 
or ninety five i q 
now i've seen them long 
to know that 
and worked with them long enough to know that 
well like i have one boy who can't spell them he still spells it t h i m 
and he took my computer apart the other day and 
adjusted something in the mother board and put it back together now it works 
now i mean 
if you saw his writing you'd think a cave man wrote it 
it looks like 
hieroglyphics or something 
but 
i want something done with my printers or my computers i just go hey jared 
i'm having trouble with this printer 
takes it all apart 
fixes it i mean 
he's 
really 
oh yeah 
well 
that's the other thing they're a lot of times they're good in the arts 
they're either 
an artist i've a boy right now that's an eighth grader that's painting 
a huge canvas for me 
for my living room 
because i haven't been able to find a picture so i brought in the picture 
and he's 
enlarging it and painting it for me 
in his free time and 
it's gonna go in my living room 
and i mean it's 
it's  i mean he's really quite the artist 
in 
music 
arts 
um 
literature acting i've had kids that've been like 
really 
top notch actors in the school plays 
it's just 
not necessarily 
a school kind of thing that they're gonna be good at 
but i try to explain to the parents that 
just because your child learns differently 
is 
no reason to think they won't be successful in life 
mark spitz 
won an olympic gold medal 
he has a learning disability 
cher bono can't remember a phone number without transposing two of the numbers 
and she says that herself 
um 
einstein didn't learn to read until he was twelve 
um 
winston churchill 
he stuttered until he was like seven or eight 
uh walt disney was told by a manager at woolworth's that he would never have a creative idea in his life 
and fired him 
um 
beethoven 
i think it 
was beethoven that didn't talk 
till he was like seven 
they thought he was retarded 
but you see these people just 
they're brain's wired differently than ours is and 
you just 
you can't ever expect them 
to approach any 
problem like you would 
because they won't 
it just doesn't seem logical to them 
they're usually real good at puzzles 
they're usually real good at 
you know 
things that 
manipulatives 
things that don't take words 
things that you just hafta solve 
by just manipulating things around 
yeah 
some of them are pretty good at that some of them aren't too 
some of them like when you have them copy uh like 
up 
from this box down to this box these little shapes 
in a certain amount of time 
if their visual perception is messed up 
they screw that all up 
they 
you know the form goes this way they draw it this way 
their brain flips it around on them 
that's why they have trouble with n's and u's 
and b's and d's 
and they're still reversing 
you know 
you 
normal kids that goes away about age eight 
my kids they're still doing it 
you know they're still 
or they might make an eight from the bottom up 
instead of from the top down or a six from the bottom up 
i even had a kid once that made ones from the bottom up 
you could tell by watching them write that their brain didn't work like yours did 
well that 
yeah  
well usually normal kids 
that's 
that's yeah it's 
developmental 
because by the 
did you know the reason they picked the age five to start school 
it's   when 
some 
expert 
thought 
that 
one hemisphere or the other 
was 
dominant 
but now they found out that the full dominance doesn't take over till about age eight 
you have a preference at five or six 
but by the time you turn eight 
one of your hemispheres is pretty much decided it's gonna be the one that runs the show 
well then 
that's when 
those reversals and all that backward fives and threes and stuff usually drops out of the picture 
so 
hm 
oh 
no 
i thought my son 
the one that's eighteen now 
i thought he was gonna be left handed up 
like four 
because his dad's left handed my sister's left handed 
i have one left handed parent 
well all of sudden one day he picked up the thing with the right hand and he's been 
with his right hand ever since 
so you really can't tell 
because they 
they're pretty much 
either or until they're about five 
and you don't have to worry if she writes her name backwards like a mirror image 
you know 
because that will all go away about second grade 
oh good 
i always hate it when people name their kids 
jamilia kenisha 
and i'm like 
oh boy 
is this 
kindergarten teacher gonna have fun with this 
little girl 
i always think you should name a kid 
i have opinions about everything see 
i think you should name a kid 
something that will fit him at eighty three 
and eight 
and in between 
like we named our son robert 
so when he was little he was robbie 
now he's eighteen he's rob 
when he becomes an attorney or whatever he wants to do he can be robert 
paul  
you know 
and 
in kindergarten all he had to learn to write was 
r o b 
or r o b b y 
so that it 
you know 
i have a hard time picturing an eighty three year old woman as a tammy 
for example so you should name 
her tamara 
and call her tammy when she's little 
and then she can be called tam 
you know when she's in her middle years and tamara when she's 
you know 
but 
you know i finally decided why people go so crazy with this name thing 
it's the one thing in life we get to do 
where there's no restrictions 
no laws 
nobody gives you any limitations or parameters 
they just say go for it and people just go nuts with it 
yeah 
over that 
right 
and 
i uh i say you should 
look 
what we did is we look in the newspaper 
and we found the top ten boys and the top ten girls names that have been the most popular for the last fifty years 
and we pick out of those 
because 
otherwise 
your kid's gonna hate you 
emma's sort of a timeless name 
in that it's 
it's 
you know 
been around for a long time 
yet 
people don't associate it with 
old women because 
there are still emma's today 
i mean 
right 
and i mean it's 
it's a  
easy to spell 
it's easy to say 
and you know  you can shorten it to m 
or 
but um 
some names are just like 
we had a friend once that 
she got pregnant 
like after her two boys were almost grown up 
and they didn't ever expect to have another kid and her mother died during her pregnancy 
so she named the little girl after her mother and her mother's name was harriet 
and i'm like 
how can you go gitchy gitchy goo harriet 
doesn't seem right 
harry yeah like oh my god what did we do like my grandmother's name was olive 
when i was born my dad said why she looks just like your mother to my mom 
and i've turned out to do everything that she did 
i've turned out to teach 
she was a teacher 
i've turned out to be 
you know real good in the kitchen and baking and 
i do like  
crafts like she did knitting and crocheting and i do that 
but i'm sure glad they didn't name me olive 
oh yeah herb 
the herbs 
the herbs 

oh 
that's almost as bad as rosie cozy i have a 
friend who 
her 
she's not really a friend she was a teacher when i was in college 
her name was mrs cozy and she got pregnant she said 
everybody said 
she came in one day and said it's a girl it's a girl i found out it's a girl what're you gonna name her rosie 
rosie cozy 
you've got to be kidding she said i'm just putting you on 
oh 
my sister's last name is goodnight and when she had her first little girl she said she was gonna name her dawn ann 
goodnight 
but she didn't 
she didn't 
telling you 
some people go nuts with the name 
i worked down at children's hospital when i was in college 
uh at the ear nose and throat 
outpatient clinic 
couple summers 
and i'm telling you i'd to 
put some names on the books like you wouldn't believe 
ima 
darling 
that was her name ima 
darling 
and there was a little boy named ephraim zimbalist 
junior 
coca cola 
franklin 
i'm supposed to fit that in a space like that 
oh i'm 
telling you 
my husband lived in a town a small town in southern ohio 
where the dentists in town were 
three brothers and they were named pain pain and pain 
dentists and it was 
p a i n 
there's some funny name stories out there boy 
but people just go nuts with their kids' names 
i just like 
would you want to 
why'd you do that to that kid 
carol harold 
well 
when you get into the black 
population 
you sometimes see some 
names 
i uh 
actually read a story 
in some book 
about this black lady that was having like her 
ninth and tenth kid and 
she didn't know what 
she had twins 
and she didn't know what to name them 
and she'd run out of names that she liked so 
they brought her um 
lunch in to her 
and the nurse jokingly said or the  
aid or something 
why don't you just pick couple of names off the menu 
so she named them 
lemonjello 
and orangello 
lemon jello 
orange jello 
she picked lemon jello orange jello and turned them into 
lemonjello and orangello 
denise and denephew 
but um 
um one time 
i read somewhere that 
a mexican lady who came across the border to have her baby 
and they put the 
little band on and they 
wrote female 
and then they wrote 
her last name 
she said to her husband when he came 
over to see her 
well they've already named her look femalee 
or  
whatever 
femalee 
female so that was her name femalee 
she thought boy they're nice in this country they even named my baby for me 
people are so stupid 
yeah i do aren't they i've seen every name eight after twenty years of 
you've spelled every name you've read every name you've written every name 
practically there aren't any that you haven't heard of 
remember a time when i was 
brand new teacher i was 
maybe  fifth or sixth year of teaching 
that's still pretty new 
this 
john 
i said john what's your last name 
he said guess 
i said i don't feel like guessing tell me your last name 
he said guess 
i said john 
i want to know your last name and he said 
g u e s s 
i'm like oh 
sorry 
thank you 
oh gosh 
he just kept saying guess guess guess 
and i kept saying 
i don't want to guess 
this is the first day of got school i lots of stuff to do we don't have time to play guessing games 
i said spell your last name he said g u e s s 
talk about feeling stupid 
oh yeah 
i'm sure 
oh 
yeah 
i heard something the other day that really  
really upset me 
i was at um 
this convention downtown the convention center 
and 
uh one of the 
ladies that was presenting one of the workshops is a 
college professor in english 
at one of the ohio colleges and she said 
when she started teaching in nineteen eighty five 
they would always 
she teaches writing 
technical writing 
for people to do when they get out into the industry world 
reports and stuff 
she said they used to say 
gear your writing 
to a person who's in the eighth grade 
she said you know what they say now 
and i raised my hand and said sixth 
she said 
fourth 
gear your writing 
for a fourth grader and everyone will that you 
that's gonna read the memo will be able to read 
well 
doesn't have any words in it like exacerbate or undoubtedly i tell you that 
but that's you know that's a sign that 
that 
not only are we doing the dumbing down of jobs 
doing the dumbing down of schools 
no that's 
reader's digest 
used to write their 
digest on the eighth grade level and they now write it on the sixth grade level 
newspapers are written between fifth and sixth grade level 
for the general public it's just 
either 
we're getting more and more l d kids that aren't learning to read 
or 
um 
kids are just not as motivated because of video games and things that 
well 
i read one article 
that said that 
because kids sit in front of a television set 
from the time they're born until they're five 
when they come to kindergarten they don't participate 
they want to sit back and be entertained 
and they're expecting you to do all this stuff 
and they're just gonna watch 
and they have to become an active learner and they have to be taught how to participate 
mm 
not so much when i was teaching it 
because 
i think 
when i was teaching it 
that was kind of before all the moms went to work 
but since 
all the moms have gone to work 
and let the tv become the electronic babysitter 
and the other thing that's happening 
is kids do not know things now that you'd expect them to know like 
because their moms aren't reading to them 
like they don't know who winnie the pooh is 
or they don't know who eyor 
or you 
say something to a kid about um three blind mice 
or you know the things that we learned when we were kids because 
our mom 
taught them or we learned them at church in a game or something 
they all look at you like 
christopher robin who's that 
piglet 
who's that 
you know these there's a whole generation of kids now 
whose moms did not stay home and read to them and all that fairy tale stuff 
and nursery rhyme stuff 
they don't have a clue what you're talking about 
well 
some of them are i guess 
depending on 
where they go but 
i had a kindergarten teacher tell me the other day that if a kid 
she only has maybe one or two kids in her whole class 
that hasn't gone to preschool 
or daycare 
and she said it takes that kid 
up till christmas 
to catch up 
with the 
things the other kids come in already knowing 
that's how far behind they are 
used to be in kindergarten you were expected 
to know your colors 
and your name and your address 
you didn't even have to write it it 
you just had to know how to say it and your phone number 
and 
um 
recognize the color words 
and 
know how to sit down and take your turn and wait in line to go to the bathroom and raise your hand and social skills 
and that was about  they expected you to 
play cooperatively 
and 
that's about all they expect you to know now in kindergarten 
they expected you to know all that 
plus by the time you get to first grade you're supposed to have 
oh and the numbers you used to 
from one to thirty 
it used to be if you could  
uh 
say them 
in order 
and recognize them 
you didn't even have to know how to spell the word 
or write them down 
now 
they want you to know the numbers one through a hundred 
you're supposed to have twenty sight words by the time you go to first grade 

like and the of is all those little words 
you're already supposed to know those 
you're supposed to 
be able to write a sentence 
even if it's just a little short sentence like my name is joanne 
i live at blah blah blah street 
i mean it's incredible 
it's like 
the curriculum keeps moving down 
and down 
and down 
well 
they're supposed to do more too but by the time they get to fourth grade they're so busy trying to be the class clown 
they decide it's a lot more important to impress your friends than it is to 
fill your mind with knowledge 
you know 
they talk about drinking from the fountain now they're only gargling 
they're not drinking 
much 
by the time they get to be fourth or fifth grade they're pretty savvy these days 
they're not 
too scared to tell you 
where to go and what to do 
oh yeah 
oh yeah used to be 
when i first started teaching even up to sixth grade kids were pretty respectful 
and they would ask you know can i do this can i use this 
uh kids now if i take my phone off and lay it on my desk 
kids will walk right up and just take it 
they won't ask me they will just  
oh 
and then they start pushing  this your phone 
i'm like 
uh 
if i were at your house and i went in your bedroom and started messing with your stuff without asking you wouldn't like it much would you 
you know 
just general manners 
i think it's because parents are at work and they're busy making money and they're not teaching their kids any 
i mean they're not  teaching them to say thank you and please and just the normal 
you know 
um thanks for having me when you go to someone's house 
just the normal 
i can't tell you how many kids i've picked up 
and driven home 
when i picked up my son because it was raining or something 
and they just jump out of the car and go bye slam the door 
and i turn to my son and i go 
don't you ever do that to someone's mother 
now how bad do you think i want to give 
him another ride home 
when he didn't even say thank you 
you know i didn't have to bother to go out of my way 
and i'd always try to use that as a 
way to explain to my kids 
okay you know 
this is how he handled it 
this is how i want you to handle it 
i don't ever want you to go to someone's house and not say 
thanks for inviting me thanks for having me 
i really had a good time 
you know and i don't ever want you to sit at somebody else's table and go 
yuk i don't like that 
you know 
if they having something for supper you don't like 
you pass it 
on and you go i don't care for any thank you 
you don't make a big scene like so and so did the other night at my house that 
you know made me feel like this big 
when i'm the cook 
you know 
so you can use all those 
opportunities 
to show your kid 
what not to do 
and you can say well that's how that makes you feel when someone goes 
eew we're having ham 
i hate ham the other night i had ham and i threw up and blah blah 
and my mom made me eat it and i threw up all over the floor and i'm like 
don't you ever do that when you're at someone else's  
they know more knowledge 
i wouldn't say they're more 
socially 
mature or uh more um 
um 
i mean there's even sweet little preschool girls that don't say please and thank you 
you know you have to remind them 
well and i think it really  it still goes back to the mom and the dad 
and 
and what 
the kid thinks would make their mom and dad happy 
you know would i act this way would that make my mom and because until you're about five 
or four 
your parents are pretty important to you 
and what they think 
so that's when 
you know 
you have to instill that stuff 
you have to 
you know 
oh and they learn by watching you do it too 
uh i mean my son now oh i saw him when let's see 
he was fifteen maybe 
he'd run across the street 
when martha the eighty six year old lady across  
was trying to bring her garbage down 
he'd seen me do that 
go oh let me get that for you martha 
she's got 
arthritis she looks like she's gonna fall 
she takes steps about this big 
and 
i've seen him do that 
he learned that from watching me do it 
he takes  you know we come home he will take the  
the thing back up for her 
oh martha will fall if she does this i better run over there and 
take that up for her 
well he's seen 
his  his mom and his dad do stuff like that 
they really do learn best by example 
they really do 
yeah they do 
they're much more likely to do what you do than do what you say 
so you don't have to say anything as long as you live a good clean honest life 
they're gonna emulate you 
oh i think 
i think that the society 
in uh general is declining in a 
ways 
our morals are  and our 
uh 
intelligence level 
maybe not level i mean i q's are still high but people are 
settling for less 
i have a big sign in my room that says never settle 
for less than your very best 
because i really think people 
are getting lazy 
even adults  you know we don't even want to wait twenty five seconds for microwave popcorn 
we don't you know we're getting impatient 
yeah we're getting impatient and we're getting 
um 
it's it's sort of like you know the pendulum will swing back the other way eventually maybe thirty years from now there will be 
kids will be you know in this country will be learning more than they ever have 
but right now i think we're 
we're really not 
doing justice 
to 
the curriculum 
and i say to  my friends i say 
teach these kids well because they're gonna be running the country in our old age 
we will be sit in a rocking chair and they will be running the country so you better teach them well 
when you look at it like that 
you it's quite an investment 
when you think that 
our major resource 
is  
is our children and our offspring 
then we'd better not 
you know 
well 
i think 
well i think in general like 
let's say if you took 
a 
handful of executives from borden or 
a t and t or 
someplace like that 
you would probably find that 
in general they're very concerned 
if they're especially if they're over forty 
because their company's giving money back to the community for this and that 
and 
you know that's how they're trying to show that they care about this they're trying to 
mentor some school or some group of kids or give money for the 
downtrodden or 
you know 
but 
you're right i think it's terrible that 
every other country in the world 
has higher math skills than we do 
better science skills than we do 
better language  than we do 
why canadians even go to school for thirteen years not twelve 
you know 
and 
i just think that 
this proficiency thing is finally going to 
make people accountable 
the proficiency tests that they're now requiring 
you can't graduate from an ohio high school 
with a  uh with a diploma 
unless you pass 
all the proficiency tests 
and that means you have to take 
one in citizenship 
which is like government and history 
one in math 
one in science 
one in writing 
and one in 
reading 
and you have 
you can try to 
pass 
the first time in the  at the end of the eighth grade 
and you get two tries in the ninth grade 
two tries in the tenth 
two in the eleventh two in the twelfth 
you can take them as many times as you need to take them 
but if you don't pass them all by the time you graduate 
you get this nifty little thing called an attendance certificate 
it's not a real diploma it's like okay i attended 
i didn't learn anything 
but i was there 
how many people want that 
and the questions aren't easy 
i mean 
i mean the 
i doubt if i could pass some of them 
i mean 
i probably could pass the citizenship and the 
and the english 
and maybe the science because i like science and i keep up on that stuff but i doubt if i could pass the math 
because i don't teach math and i don't use math that much 
other than just normal 
you know add subtract multiply 
yeah and geometry and and trig and calculus and physics and 
a little smattering of everything 
and uh 
i bet i couldn't pass the 
i bet i couldn't pass the math without some 
instruction 
but 
my son didn't pass the writing part he passed everything but the writing part 
and the writing part 
they ask you to write 
two 
five paragraph essays and they give you these topics and you can pick from them 
and you have to do it right there 
in like a three hour block of time 
no 
the prompts are only given out that day 
even the teachers don't know what they're gonna be 
and it might be something as general as tell about your neighborhood 
or it might be something as specific as 
when you were little what 
toy was your most favorite 
and you have to write five paragraphs on it 
so 
no more than five because there's a specific 
um 
it's called the five paragraph essay 
the first paragraph is your introduction and the final one is your conclusion and the three in the middle is the body that develops your idea 
so 
i'm teaching all my kids right 
one of those 
on different topics 
oh it's some committee 
i mean you have to send them in to 
some place at the state of ohio 
no 
we send them in 
and then 
the kids 
lets see the eighth graders take them in march and then we get the  
the scores back in may 
sometime 
and um 
some of my kids 
well i have a group of kids that i had them when they were sixth graders and they just now graduated 
from high school and  
one in that original group of kids that i had 
never did pass them all 
but 
i guess 
he's not worried because he's gonna work with his dad in his dad's business 
so he's gonna be okay but 
he never did pass the reading and the writing he passed everything else but 
and the questions aren't the same 
i mean there's several different forms every time they send out 
the test it's sealed in a box and 
nobody is allowed to open it but the principal 
and 
then he has to distribute it the teachers and 
so the questions could change 
and they might be something as easy as what are the three colors in our flag 
or uh how much of a 
uh 
how much do you have to have of the senate 
to pass a law 
you know it could be something real real 
technical or something 
that 
a three year old could answer 
because it's trying to hit 
you know 
all the areas that you've learned 
i think they're retired teachers or 
people on maybe the board at different school districts or 
i don't know 
well 
course the multiple choice there's a right or wrong answer and 
but 
the writing 
they give you one point for each 
paragraph so you hafta get 
five points to pass 
now you might get four out of five and almost pass 
and then you hafta retake that one part 
well yeah that's kind of subjective although 
there is a paper that 
we hand out to our kids that's tells exactly what's supposed to be in every part of this essay 
like the first the introductory paragraph's supposed to consist of 
a way to capture the reader's attention 
it's suppose to supply background information 
it's supposed to state your thesis statement which tells mainly what the  paper's gonna be about 
and then you're supposed to end the introductory paragraph by listing three ideas 
about your thesis 
that you're going to develop in paragraphs two three and four 
so i mean it's 
well most kids what they do is 
they tell something in the body that should be in the body way up here in the  
most people get ahead of themselves 
you know before they 
tell you 
this was last summer and it was on a vacation to myrtle beach 
they're telling you about the surfboard that they got 
and how 
great they surfed 
when that really should come down in the body of the paper 
you know most people just 
they assume the reader knows 
i always say to my kids 
pretend like you're writing for an alien 
nothing about this planet 
like i had my kids last week i had them all write 
how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich 
and then 
i had them one by one come up to the table in the front they didn't know i was gonna do this 
so after they get  all done i go out and i get my little bag of stuff and i bring in my bread and my peanut butter and my jelly 
and i sit them down beside me 
and i go okay now no ad libbing 
no adding no taking away read exactly what you wrote 
and i do exactly what they said 
if they say cover the entire piece of bread with peanut butter 
i cover both sides 
crust 
uh the entire piece of bread 
if they say reach in the 
bag and grab two pieces of bread i reach in the bag and grab them and by the time i get them out they've got holes in them 
because to me that's what grab means 
whereas 
you know 
if you just said take 
or get 
i just 
i say well 
i'm just gonna 
because when you get 
work 
out in the work world 
there's gonna be two things they care about about your writing 
is it useable 
and is it persuasive 
because usually when you're writing something in the workplace 
it's either to explain something 
or it's to persuade somebody to do something 
so if it's not those two things 
it's not 
it's not writing 
that's gonna make it in the world 
it's i mean 
oh i have a few kids from time to time that said they want to be writers 
which you know they have great ideas but usually 
they can't 
they can tell you them but when they write it 
my kids 
usually 
they leave out words or they 
leave off a suffix at the end or and the sentence makes no sense 
you know 
i have to call them up and go 
what does this say 
or does this say this 
you know 
this is what i thought this said does that what that really says 
well here's a perfect example the other day 
my kids 
my sixth graders turned in papers on if i could be an animal here's the animal i would be and here's why 
and they had to research the animal they had like a month to do it 
and they had to pick any animal and tell about their feeding habits and their 
whether they travel in groups or alone and 
of what part of the world they mostly habitat 
what they eat all that 
okay perfect example 
one of my students wanted to say 
my animal 
that i picked lives mostly on vegetables 
and he couldn't figure out how spell it 
so he went into the computer and he 
asked it 
and it gave him the word vestibules 
said to me that can't be wrong because the computer said 
that was a word 
i said that is a word 
come with me i will show you what a vestibule is 
so we walked across the street to the church 
i said there's a big 
that's a vestibule 
does your animal eat those 
my animal eats mostly vestibules 
i 
mean you see 
the computer 
can't be wrong he said 
i said well he  it didn't spell vestibules wrong 
but i doubt if your animal eats 
parts of buildings 
perfect you know or your computer can't tell you that you 
spelled o n e 
when you meant to spell 
w o n 
we won we were victorious 
we didn't one 
oh yeah 
uh 
uh 
well a lot of my kids do much better 
with writing on the computer 
because they know that 
they can go back and change it or fix it or they can get spelling help or they can even get grammar help 
or they can maybe even get 
syntax help  
if it says this is awkward or something turn the sentence around 
so my students do a lot better with writing if they do it on the computer 
than if they are asked to do it 
pencil and paper 
so that's what i make them do their webbing 
you know what a webbing is don't you 
where you  
web out an idea you 
and looks like a spider web 
i make them do their webbing 
and get their rough draft started 
and then they can go to the computer 
because they i find they um they are a little more creative when they get to 
think about adding pictures and 
we call it publishing it 
when you get to the publishing stage 
you should have all your errors corrected 
even if you 
have to rewrite it six times i mean  it just blows their mind when i say to them 
well the other day i wrote a letter to a senator 
and i had to write it six times 
i wrote the letter 
and rewrote it 
until it was perfect 
and every time i rewrote it it got better 
and i wrote it six times 
and i'm an english teacher 
and i tell them writing is not an event 
it's a process 
it's like getting your braces put on 
you go in one time 
and they might pull a couple teeth 
and you go in the next time they might put that little wire on 
then you go in the next time they might put the lower ones on or part of them 
and the next time 
then they put on more 
and then one time 
they will tighten them a little 
but it's a process that happens over a period of three years 
it's not an event 
they think they can sit down and write 
okay i'm done 
i'm like 
i don't think so 
writing is a 
yeah 
well and 
don't you think 
yeah 
well i often have to write on papers 
i believe you turned in the wrong paper 
i believe i got the rough draft instead of the final copy 
do you have the final copy somewhere at home 
or on your hard drive 
um 
because this really for all the world looks to me just like a rough draft 
or i will say to my students have your mom look it over have your sister look it over 
have somebody else proofread it 
because you're not gonna see the mistakes because 
you're too busy thinking about the content 
of what you wanted to say 
and you're not gonna notice them spelled t h i m 
or they t h a y 
yeah 
or a sentence that's too long 
or a sentence that's a fragment and it isn't a complete thought 
you're not gonna notice that 
because you know what it was supposed say 
so give it to a p friend or somebody and let them 
just on your rough copy just let them circle anything they don't understand 
and that will really help you 
oh 
well i had a 
i had a student bring me a paper today 
he said this is for history 
i have to write an essay on anthony wayne 
and the battle at fallen timbers 
here's my rough draft 
would you fix it for me before i make my final copy so i will get a good grade 
see  i tell them i said 
what i'm here for 
you know 
i'm here to help you 
use me 
to help you get better grades 
use me to run interference 
if you think you know the science 
but you're getting marked down because you can't spell the words 
let me know i will go talk to your science teacher 
tell her not to count your spelling 
or not 
you know not to make you take the test without the little spell checker thing that's in your book bag 
to let you use that i mean 
i do a lot of um 
what i call advocating for my kids with the regular ed teachers that don't understand 
i go in and i say well 
you know this is kind of a long test 
could he maybe take half today and half tomorrow 
or 
would you mind if he came out to my room 
ninth period during study hall 
because i have a free 
and i could 
like kind of monitor it and 
and read the words he doesn't know so that he's actually answering what the question really says 
instead of what he thinks it says 
so that you won't be testing his reading ability but you will really be testing whether he knows about magnetism 
oh 
oh yes they're getting better though they really are 
they're much better now than they were twenty years ago 
because 
trend is 
these students in the mainstream as much as possible 
so teachers are having to learn 
to 
for example 
yeah how to modify 
like 
i give 
in services all the time at my school for the regular ed teachers and i show them 
they go well that's gonna make more work for me and i say how is telling the student to do every other problem 
instead of all forty of them gonna make 
i'm 
so 
or 
how hard can it be to say to a student if you have a student with an eighty i q for example 
and you know he's not gonna get all the details and the battles and the years and the 
captain's names but 
you just want him to get the overall gist of the french and american war was about this time uh  
in history and this was the result and this is how long it lasted 
just the main concepts 
well there's the kid that you say 
todd 
you study for the test and when you come in i will let you answer anything on the test you know 
and anything you don't know you leave blank 
and i will just grade what you put down 
now that doesn't make any extra work for the teacher 
but 
it gives him a shot 
he usually will answer 
the concepts he will usually answer the main stuff that he knows 
and if you only grade him on that 
he might have a shot at a c or a b 
i mean there's 
all kind of ways to modify 
uh  
give a reduced work amount 
uh give a kid a copy of another students notes if his are crummy and he  can't study from them 
we even have a thing at our school 
that 
it's 
it looks just like notebook paper 
and it's got the three holes and the lines and every teacher has a stack of it on their desk 
but it's 
n c r 
you know the 
two copies 
you write on the top 
n c r paper 
so when you write on the white copy it comes through onto the yellow copy 
and at the end of the period 
the student just rips off the back copy and hands it to his friend 
so he didn't have to write 
you know if he wasn't getting the notes 
and he didn't spell them and he couldn't read them later 
nobody has to know that 
so and so went down the hall and made a copy of so and so's notes on the xerox machine for the dumb kid 
you know 
you just 
you know you just 
say to one 
student that sits in the front that's usually a girl 
who usually you know writes really neat and gets it all 
just go suzy would you 
use this paper today 
because we're gonna review for the test 
and then at the end of the period 
when the kids are leaving 
and give johnnie a copy of it 
the back copy would you do that for me 
well the girls usually write neater 
and they usually get 
a girl that doesn't have a learning disability they usually get everything down off the board 
whereas the boys 
get a little distracted 
or they will 
you know maybe not  
they don't tend to sit up front 
they will sit in the back so they can 
you know 
jab their friend with a pencil and 
throw the  
paper wads and stuff 
so 
oh yeah 
almost always 
doesn't matter what 
um the disability is 
don't know why this is 
but they used to say eight to one 
now they're saying more like five to one 
doesn't matter if it's a speech impediment 
blindness retardation 
cerebral palsy deafness 
learning  you name it 
there's  
five to one more boys than there are girls 
and we don't 
know why 
well deafness for example uh and blindness are not always genetic 
they don't know why 
they just know that  
shows up more in boys than girls 
this year i don't have 
one i have sixteen students 
and i don't have one girl 
fact i haven't had any girls for a couple of years 
i usually have one or two girls and all the rest boys 
but 
oh 
they're not as many of them or 
you mean because 
well um 
in the lower grades i believe that they are because 
i think they should have some male 
role models 
the lower grades 
we have a few 
male teachers at first grade and fourth grade but not many 
but i think 
that 
young men 
young boys would do better 
in a 
setting in school if they had a 
a man earlier on 
rather than having to wait till 
they're in middle school 
to relate to a coach 
and up until then it's always been a woman 
don't go into elementary ed that much 
that often 
they do but 
there's just not near as many of them 
i can count on one hand the number of 
um 
men teachers i've known over the years in elementary ed 
practically 
you know five 
maybe six 
that's that's probably why the boys don't 
you know 
really 
and it's a fun job it really is i  i've only ever known one male 
that taught first grade 
and i knew one guy that taught third 
most the time if they go in to elementary ed they go for the upper grades like four five or six 
but um 
i really think that 
if we let 
the boys be more exposed to men earlier 
then 
they would 
be more motivated to learn 
because they would see that it's not just a girly thing 
they would say oh well mister so and so thinks it's important that i know this 
and he's a real macho guy so i better learn it 
you know 
i do i really do 
nowadays 
with the pay 
being better 
we are getting more men 
but 
in most  
in most  in most school districts it's 
comparable 
to 
any other job now it used to always be low but 
like a 
beginning teacher in worthington starts at i think twenty six 
eight 
or something 
course worthington's 
one of the 
three highest paid districts in ohio 
um 
but 
it used to be that 
teachers 
just got paid 
lower than a  
starting fireman or starting policeman and 
you know you in a sense you're out there risking your life everyday too 
now that kids are carrying knives and guns and 
things to school you never know if you're gonna walk into the building and 
and maybe not go home that day 
yeah 
yeah 
people say 
things like 
oh i wish i had a job where i got three months off every summer 
and i'm just i hear people say stuff like that in the grocery store and i just want to walk up to the guy and grab him around the neck and say 
yeah and yesterday while you were watching the football game 
i was grading papers at the kitchen table 
you know 
and if i go out of town on the weekend 
i have to take my school bag and all my work with me 
it never ends 
you know i put in about seventy hours a week during 
the time of the year when i do teach 
and by the way it's not three months anymore 
you work for a week after the kids get out of school in june 
which usually 
puts you at about the twelfth to the fifteenth of june 
school starts back the twenty third of august 
at least in worthington it did 
and you have to be back a week before that 
so they've shaved both ends of that off till it's 
it's like 
days in june 
and maybe 
fifteen days in august 
and all of july 
so 
and then you spend some of that time going to seminars 
and upgrading your certificate 
taking classes 
hopefully 
that's when you go to the dentist  you know you catch up on all that stuff too 
right if you're lucky 
but i mean 
there's the person that says that and then there's the other person that says 
oh i sure admire what you do and i wouldn't be a teacher for anything in this world 
you know and the the one that's just in awe of you 
and then there's the one that's like i wish i had two weeks off at christmas 
well i used to work at harding hospital as a teacher 
when 
um 
i first went to worthington when i said i got another job 
i got 
a job 
working at harding hospital as the 
i was the principal 
but i was also a teacher so i taught part of the day 
and i was also the administrator 
because they had a small school there for the kids that were in the adolescent unit 
and they were away from home and they had to go to school and get their credit somewhere 
so 
the doctors always used to 
we were on the 
like each 
person would be on a team 
of these kids that would be assigned to these kids 
and you'd go to your team meetings and the doctors 
the  shrinks would go 
i wish i got two weeks off at christmas you know they'd be bitching and moaning about the fact that 
that we got time off and they didn't 
finally come up with the perfect thing one time i said well doctor simpson or whatever his name was doctor brown 
you know how it is some of us went for the big bucks and some of us went for the time off 
he never said a thing again 
like oh okay we went for the big bucks 
we went for the time off 
everybody makes their choices 
now you got to live with them 
these kids don't get well just because it's the holidays 
you guys should stay here and work along with us 
yeah right 
we should also get 
a hundred and twenty five bucks an hour like you guys do to 
oh i will come back 
i mean 
if you need me to 
really 
wow 

okay 
it's very difficult 
yeah 
i don't know why 
uh columbus was just stubborn about it until 
the last year 
uh 
they hadn't  able to get subs fifty  
substitutes fifty percent of the time and so the teachers were screaming 
and they were splitting the kids up and putting them in other classrooms well 
i don't know if the parents made anything about it but i guess 
finally 
you know when you have fifty percent of your classrooms uncovered 
uh they 
came to it and it got so used to be nobody appreciated a substitute nobody 
the kids the principal or the other teachers but now it's like 
oh thank you for coming oh thank you for coming 
so i said maybe that worked a little bit but now just in the last two weeks 
i think a lot of the retired teachers who weren't messing around with it have come back in 
so i don't know exactly what to 
yeah 
well 
uh 
when i came 
uh back from oregon 
my father was very ill 
and so i didn't want full time work and i started substituting out in uh licking county 
um 
which 
paid    terribly low  
there's all these little districts that has 
a superintendent 
well no they have two elementaries one middle school and one high school and a superintendent which they don't need you know 
so they'd 
hire 
straight out of college always 
and there there is a law that  
uh you have to pay 
for your accumulated time 
so i couldn't get a job out there because i had about six years experience they had to pay me 
for 
so i came  back in to columbus and it's a lot harder to work in columbus public but 
but um 
i i know the territory i know where i'm 
the population 
is much different yes 
well  you have 
uh you have an urban area with a lot of poor children 
uh 
a lot of single parent families and just the population is changing period 
from the uh the two parent family very 
the mother not working into 
one parent with the mother working it makes a big difference in how the 
child does at school 
yes it's definitely having an effect on uh children and uh 
uh the schools are trying to catch up or make up for it but they aren't doing it yet 
whether they will be able to pick up enough 
um 
by changing the way they teach and so on in the next twenty years i don't know but 
uh i'm glad my children went to school when they did 
stayed home with them 
you should be 
real attentive to what's happening in his school situation 
his or her 
yeah  you should be we're all aware because the school has a big  
impact on the children and sometimes not all that positive right now 
so 
you know but you can tell 
how your child's doing of course 
uhhum 
at this point 
um 
i'm not  
uh i'm not against the urban schools but if it was my own personal child i wouldn't  
move to a suburban area until columbus gets their act together 
they are  
in so uh such bad shape right now that 
i do think the state will take over the columbus public schools in two years yeah 
they've threatened it 
um 
and if they don't pull their scores up 
um they will 
you know 
no 
uh 
my  
uh well i'm 
um my opinion changes from day to day on 
uh 
actually 
at this point in time i don't know who's fault it is 
uh i think it's the  
fault of evolution 
well it could have been prevented but we didn't know it was gonna happen that  
that our society was gonna change so intensely and we kind of 
hung back and thought things would stay the same way they were and they haven't and everybody's changing and 
especially the younger people 
and uh 
we weren't ready and we didn't change fast 
ready for the change that was coming 
columbus 
it seems to be 
i mean it's just like blah 
i at this point i blame it on the administration 
um 
and the citizens of columbus haven't i mean uh two years ago or was it three years ago now 
they defeated a levy 
you should never defeat a school levy 
you know they never ask for extra money 
and uh 
they had to cut back on everything and  i think it just set people back now we're trying real hard to catch up 
and at some point we're going to um 
you know have to put a levy on again and  and 
uh 
who knows what's happen 
we're keeping rosa smith right now because she's 
so good p r with the 
with the business community 
but the business community in columbus doesn't really support the schools  they don't 
i mean we've got two new uh 
stadiums and we haven't got any increase in school funding 
started the school year off with uh 
twenty seven kindergarteners 
and 
no aid 
and they were just wild 
you know i just ran every minute and i 
took it as a substitute 
and didn't 
know from day to day you know whether was gonna keep it i finally had to say i cant do this twenty seven kindergarteners 
i'm sorry i can't do this 
the teacher was there one day and she was pregnant with twins and the second day she was in the hospital 
those things happen 
yeah 
they had to  
and they just called me on the phone not knowing 
you know 
just that she went to the hospital 
well they said to me will you stay well i said yes 
but then  
when it got in to 
two weeks and i wasn't getting any support from the principal or no aid or anything it's like i'm sorry 
i'm a 
substitute i'm getting sixty dollars a day i can't 
do this 
unless 
you know i have more help 
and i just 
flatly said that i'm sorry i mean 
if i'd a 
if it was my own job i would have struggled with it but it was not my own job 
and i didn't know what was gonna happen 
so 
if they would've gotten some help in there  
for me i would have stayed perhaps but 
no i i 
you know you can work for under pay and under 
you just can't do everything 
so 
a computer calls you 
uh uh 
you talk to a computer always 
you deal with a computer 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uh 
they have a whole listing of numbers of reasons why you don't want to do it  
most usually i just put location 
i don't want to go certain places uh 
well like 
a  miles down to the south end or something like that 
but you just punch in your numbers always you just talk with numbers 
uh huh 
yeah 
uhhum 
oh really 
where are you from 
uhhum  i i did i 
hm 
what's different  
my old neighborhood is just exactly the same and so  
from that angle was i mean still is my 
elementary school sitting there i went to for nine years and then north is not being used as a high school but it's there 
a block away olentangy village 
i'm right in where i always was i mean i'm 
i  was raised on como avenue and i live two blocks away from there now 
so i made a  
full circle there but columbus has changed in the downtown area 
and it is really neat 
you know compared to any other cities course 
i'm 
i loved oregon i was very rural 
for eighteen years 
um um i was at eugene and i wasn't even 
it was hundred thousand you know 
and uh 
i loved that but 
i  
then i came back and i live in olentangy village which is right on the river 
and it's very uh 
very scenic very beautiful 
oh 
oh did you come in 
uhhuh 
it's kind of an neat place isn't it 
uh huh it's got 
yeah 
and uh well she  the  
uh the people that own it are starting to build it 
up now but it's been like that it was the first apartment community um 
in columbus it was built in thirty 
eight i guess 
uhhuh 
uh huh 
and that's what i like about it is the ambience and the 
the river and the 
oh oh 
and the apartments are just very very plain 
and but uh 
it's 
it is it is it's a 
it's kind of a oasis in the middle of the city 
so 
uh no the only thing 
that was really down there before i moved out was 
leveque tower 
the shortest one 
uh but of course the university is just about the same in some ways 
the stadium and all that 
it's better in terms of the arts 
and there's all kinds of things going on i mean you could if you had the 
it's 
it's better in terms 
of the uh 
city government 
seems to the people seem to be more aware of what they're doing and it's not 
oh well i will just do this it's kind of like you know 
there's some brains down there 
yeah i'm a democrat and i've never voted for a republican in my life even when i lived in oregon 
and i always 
adored mark hatfield 
was the weirdest thing 
because i thought he was a great 
but i think uh personally mike coleman 
was good i 
i've met uh well 
we had a diamond jubilee at the village and 
and coleman and teater both came and they both i thought it was in some ways kind of a close race i mean i didn't think that  
there was much that much difference in them  
i think you know she would do just about the same as he is he might be a little bit better but 
um 
i 
in terms of having a black mayor i think that's good for columbus 
i  
i hope so yeah 
hm oh that's a real major 
uh hm 
no i don't think it's too bad 
i mean 
um 
well 
uh well we could go into the issue of uh 
the columbus board of education what's his name 
he is always 
moss 
oh this is  and that's  but i don't 
think 
it's too bad in columbus 
i know there're places lots  
like the south and so on 
course 
uh who who really knows 
the race issue is such a big question 
i like him personally and when he was running for uh mayor i would have voted for him i met him and everything but i guess he just is 
plays the devil's  advocate all the time at the uh 
at the 
the um school board meetings i 
i heard this is just a  
you want gossip in here 
want some gossip 
the gossip i heard was that um 
um 
the superintendent of schools said that if 
yeah he was he's gonna always be reelected he's got his  
yeah 
i 
uh his wife's a teacher and i understand an excellent teacher so i think he has real good information 
um 
that he works with 
well i think she maybe  
uh 
retired last year but she had   taught 
columbus for twenty years or something like that 
and so i think his information is good 
but i guess 
way 
handles things sometimes gets 
yeah 
uhhum 
he always has 
whenever he  
well i thought he was gonna be elected uh 
mayor too but he didn't there but i don't know what that was about but 
um 
uh 
you know he's got his  and their gonna reelect him because he stands up for the minority 
i think he what he 
makes a mistake is saying labeling things racist that are not  
necessarily racist but anyway 
um hum 
maybe we're beyond that 
we shouldn't 
always be saying 
um yeah 
yeah 
well 
um 
that's i don't know    
how to explain that 
to this 
um 
i had a friend that taught classes 
human potential classes 
was very interested 
and participated very in depth in the human potential movement 
so um uh 
a a gentleman by the name of alexander everett 
uh who 
really is the father of the human potential movement 
moved out there and he was gonna have 
a group of people work out there and uh 
and he said that 
you know i was qualified well when we got out there it just fell through 
you know and we all just lived our lives 
but i was glad that 
you know that he got me out there 
i  
i just loved it out there 
oh it's just so  the environment of course is 
incredibly beautiful 
um 
and 
everybody is more uh 
i think 
more open 
or 
more receptive to relationships 
and um 
you know 
i think it's a  much friendlier place and then uh i i just think the vibrations are higher out there you just don't have poverty 
well 
if anybody's in poverty in oregon it's because they've chosen to live 
a simple life it's not a 
you know because they can't get jobs and things like that although the 
is not that great but you know 
they say in eugene 
that even the dishwashers have p h d's they 
well the the um 
the level of 
the years of education per capita is probably the highest in the country 
so 
yeah they have a lot of 
educated people who aren't out to just make a bunch of money so it 
makes for an very intellectual 
interesting 
environment 
but 
people are trying to live simply there 
and i kind of agree with that 
oh yeah 
well 
i don't know 
um 
oh well 
in oregon well 
i was down in california for three months and uh 
and uh i went to the  
produce stand and i took my umbrella 
and of course it doesn't rain too 
and i said 
oh i'm from oregon and i always think it's gonna rain and he says well i'm from washington and i know 
but uh 
um 
well something's happening of course to the planet on uh 
weather patterns and uh there been having droughts in oregon which is so strange 
but when i was there it 
it um 
it rains from november through june it rains i mean     they say on the weather in the morning 
showers changing to rain and then 
say 
but they don't use umbrellas i mean they just go through it they're just so used to it and they wear that kind of jacket you know uh no 
because it's not a hard rain 
and the first year i was there it was pretty hard to get used to it but there's no cold real cold winter 
and uh 
and then from 
july 
august september and october's just gorgeous 
just so gorgeous 
but i like 
i like that fog and that 
mist and those evergreen 
yeah 
it  
it is 
yeah 
or you could do 
the university of oregon it's a very nice very small university but it's nice 
i forget the name well i don't think there's a university of portland but there's two 
two or yes there is a university i can't think of which one it is 
right now 
speaking of opinions did you see the paper today about the thing in seattle they're having this big  
and 

it's like oh 
well i haven't read enough to know i 
i saw uh 
uh 
uh preliminary thing that they were going to protest 
and 
uh 
but i don't  i'm not 
informed enough to give an opinion 
i don't  that  i think that that what they were protesting was that they weren't  being  involved in it wasn't that part of their protest 
they weren't being represented 
i don't know 
i will have to read 
i didn't read 
paper yet 
no did you 
it's probably because put your ad it was in the paper in the summer when we weren't 
now we're busy 
oh 
i have just the same opinion i think most people have as the tv 
i mean i 
i i mean that probably can be proven i don't know if anybody would do any 
decent studies on it i just bet you a million dollars that 
you know it would be the influence of tv 
you know the 
and then 
and 
another thing that's 
well tv is the  
uh 
where it comes from but like the kids are all into pokemon right now 
and it uh they have these fads that go through and somebody asked me my opinion about the pokemon i said oh brother 
you know 
it couldn't be any worse than what was those turtles that lived in the 
ninja 
well the kids went into that just so 
and they were supposed to be real good guys but i mean what uh the visual 
was pretty miserable in my opinion they wore these masks 
and hoods 
and 
and they fought a lot 
and there was lot of violence 
and then 
i love walt disney i mean all that stuff they have beautiful music but i 
i swear i haven't seen a walt disney movie that doesn't have violence in it 
i mean just like beauty and the beast there's extreme amount of violence in there 
uh 
you know just every one there's a  
a bad dark side in the story so 
children just are  and i mean it's 
in their 
and then 
including my own daughter she 
and i'd 
swear 
i had her watch mister 
but  
now that she's older she watches tv 
she's addicted to 
tv something terrible and then so of course her children are 
uh 
so 
but i think 
you know 
i was 
i didn't have 
tv when i was a child child 
and i think 
you know it 
it stimulates the imagination in some ways but i don't know what direction that imagination really goes you know 
and 
but there's a tremendous amount of violence in front of everybody's face anymore 
as matter of fact i'm getting so i don't watch the news 
i dislike i can't take any more of it 
i seen this a thousand times now people fighting killing this murder that murder 
it's like the same thing 
over and over and over we just keep repeating and repeating our bad stuff instead of getting off of it 
the yeah 
you know 
yeah huh huh huh huh 
yeah 
you 
uh i 
you know i've just come to 
i always you know prefer for my children 
and 
myself i mean uh if there's anything  
disney i usually go and watch it you know at the movie theater 
and after a while it's like 
i think beauty and the beast is where it really came through to me it's like 
that's a wonderful story but do they have to have all that killing and so on in the middle right in the middle of it 
and the  way disney sells i think is they do have beautiful music 
but then  
it's like it 
some 
evil person back there in the screening room puts some of this junk in there right in the middle 
and then you go you can't stop and not watch that you 
you  
and if i was in charge of it i'd cut some of it out it's 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
um hum  
no asking each other opinions or anything like 
no kind of 
of 
um 
you know 
uh 
it  it just seems like our 
uh society just has that 
you have to 
be 
just horrible to a person because they're bad well 
you and i know that a bad person doesn't become better by being bad to them 
you know what i  
it's uh 
i mean 
we're i hope we're getting to the place we know that 
that uh 
we'd 
we don't necessarily overcome bad by bad we're still very much in that framework of reference in this 
on this 
okay 
drooping down 
okay 
i'm  bouncing around too much 
um hum 
yeah 
yeah 
okay 
um 
that's our planet 
um hum hum hum 
yeah 
um yeah 
yes 
uh 
well i'm very much 
my baseline philosophy is thou shalt not kill and that goes really a long ways for me that includes uh 
being a vegetarian 
and uh 
um 
and 
uh 
most of our wars i would have 
yet 
although on the other hand i 
i have to admit that 
there has been some stuff that we haven't been able to stop without it 
um 
and  
and that's too bad you know that 
things things are 
have been that bad in some 
like 
oh world war two  
i mean 
we didn't really have any choice there not that 
but uh 
some of the 
some of our wars have been unnecessary and uh 
so but 
you know you can get you can get a philosophy but it doesn't have always apply every single 
case you know what i mean 
i am against capital punishment the 
the guy that they um 
uh 
executed here in ohio last  
fall did you know about it 
you  
if you weren't here well 
he was the first capital punishment case in ohio in ah 
twenty or twenty-five years or something like that and he killed somebody and he was on death row 
and he wanted to be executed 
and i thought that's a cop-out if there ever was one just to 
give him a lethal injection and let him go 
he should have rotted in prison for 
no that's not a punishment 
he was off his rocker 
there isn't anybody who murders who isn't insane 
you know technically there's insanity and there isn't insanity but in my opinion there is nobody who ever killed anybody who isn't insane 
and uh 
just to 
to 
knock them out 
is 
is not appropriate 
they need to be 
we need to try to 
save them 
i mean 
not in the terms of a christian saving but 
uh 
to make them work that off 
and uh 
face it 
and come 
in their 
own mind to their own guilt 
and um 
um 
so 
i got two sides to that once they need to work 
because they did it and the other side is 
if we keep 
uh 
i  
i believe in the  
uh  
uh reincarnation and the law of cause and effect 
and if a person murders somebody they need they will they will pay for that later there's no question about that in the next life 
but 
also i think that they should be made to face their 
um 
their guilt and what they've done and and 
a lot of them don't they say that hardened criminals 
real hard criminals will not ever admit that they did anything wrong and they have to 
they need to 
uhhum hum 
uhhum 
yeah  
well what um what my opinion on our whole penal system is just 
you know 
well it goes along with not 
kind of neglecting the kids in our schools  now and we're definitely  
neglecting criminals they need to have 
be educated and 
and worked with 
i mean they need to obviously they some place some point they've 
uh learned 
incorrect 
reasoning or whatever you call it and and they need to uh 
they need to have psychological help 
period 
yeah 
uhhum yeah 
yeah 
that's where we are in our 
there's a lot 
we need to do a lot of evolving 
we 
do 
uhhum hum 
i don't know uh in 
i don't 
uh for a while we got it stopped the 
thing that 
is 
uh 
confusing to me 
is that sometimes we will get something stopped for twenty five 
or 
thirty years or ten or fifteen 
and then we go back it's like hey we got moved ourselves out of that 
why are we going back to it now 
um 
and and i think 
you know the papers keep saying that our  
uh 
crime rate is going down and everything 
and so 
uh 
i think that's because we 
some people are 
you know trying to make it 
deal with these people as people the who are ill or are sick and try to help them with their 
you 
you know it took us a long time to figure out that 
alcoholism is a disease okay and uh so now we try to help  alcoholics 
well well 
certainly 
helped not  you know 
um 
well stick them in a 
place where they can just concentrate on it even more 
so 
we got a long ways to go there 
yeah 
um yeah 
yeah anger 
it's always anger 
well 
i will have a  
maybe when i 
i'm a hundred i will have that figured out 
because i went to oregon 
and of course 
uh 
the greater part of the population out there are more 
socialists than they are capitalists and they're easier to deal with and they're more reasonable people in my 
but then i come back to columbus and all my family and and 
and all 
i'm the minority in my family 
and uh 
they're very in to capitalism and their lives are working pretty good for them so 
so 
um 
it seems 
the picture is kind of 
hard to deal with people that are in to capitalism have 
a 
pretty good lives 
and they have what they want and they don't uh 
seem to have such serious problems so 
people who try to go against that current can get it theirselves into big trouble 
so 
and capitalism has made the united states go i mean it has worked 
uh and we are ahead of the world there's no question about that and what the individual people 
persons have and how their lives go much better 
on the other hand 
um 
you know i'm 
i'm actually what i would like 
uh 
if it would just spread all over the world 
true communism 
true communism 
not as it was practiced in russia but 
uh 
where people 
um share and uh 
share power and share money and 
equally but with the where we are in our evolution that we're not ready for it  
actually i  when i was in oregon i did a lot of experimenting and i lived in an intentional community which was 
actually 
trying 
uh 
to 
we never used the word 
but um 
i'm sure plenty of people used the word 
but we  uh we shared everything 
that we had 
and 
supposedly 
we had a true 
uh 
sharing 
but 
um 
in terms of government i don't 
we weren't ready for that because we had more of a matriarchy 
one woman who was 
decisive and made 
decisions and we would 
but um 
if a 
if a 
we could get ourselves to the place where it would work 
that would be great 
and i would 
very  and i 
then in the year that i lived in that community was one of the  
best years of my life 
it was 
um 
the reason 
that it was one of the best years of my life is 
it's in a  
incredibly beautiful setting 
and the people that came to participate in that were very very high people 
and it was mostly of course young people but they were 
incredibly 
idealistic 
and 
incredibly searching for answers 
in 
um 
i mean their questions and their conversations talk about opinions 
as a matter of fact the that's only thing i  
difficult about 
about living there was 
they would be asking all these 
trying to 
that it's like 
i don't want to do the dishes i just want to answer the questions 

and the 
um that was 
part of the process there to how to work work and work 
up there too with people 
but 
if we could just share more 
i would be a lot happier 
mm yeah 
i hope we're gonna get there 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah it's gonna have to be from the bottom up i think 
and everybody keeps and i  i'm just getting a kick out of all the advertisements and everything they're coming 
with two thousand on it 
well i'm hoping 
people are making a big deal and making a big advertisement and selling a lot of stuff because of it but i'm hoping 
that it 
does mean  since people are so focused on it does mean a shift in consciousness i hope 
uh 
y two k i don't know what that really stands for 
i have to think of some words there but 
you know i hope uh since everybody is just 
making it into a big deal that maybe it will be a big deal 
yeah 
yeah yeah 
yeah 
oh yeah 
there's always people out there 
actually i wore out 
i sort of wore out 
um 
that 
and 
um 
just 
oh there were two reasons i left one i was getting 
exhausted 
and uh 
it was just 
so demanding 
and 
we didn't know as a community how to let  
uh up 
i had to withdraw 
another thing was 
i'm very into um 
metaphysics 
and studying and meditating we had no time whatsoever everybody was 
in there 
um 
that's one disagreement i have with intentional communities that they stay open all except in january so there's always people 
coming for 
four 
or five days 
and you have 
and plus we 
uh lived in um 
a 
a rural setting where we did everything ourselves plus ran a restaurant 
and a hardware and had a mail route 
and then we had all these visitors and then we and then we 
uh made our own bread and we 
uh 
milked a cow 
so it's just  plain 
hard physical work 
plus all the mental 
um stuff of dealing with people's really big questions 
it  
it was 
you know so that's the reason i had to quit is was 
like 
if i could 
leave this situation for a month or six weeks 
and get caught up within myself 
i would have been okay but 
that wasn't how it worked 
so had to 
to pull back from it 
uh uh uh 
i have one daughter thirty six years old 
she lives in toledo and then i have two grandchildren 
uhhum yeah uhhum 
yeah 
no not often 
uh my daughter has a very um 
intense life 
and uh 
so um 
i don't see them near as often as i like 
right we just do a one day thing 
because it's fairly easy to drive to toledo so i go 
real early in the morning 
and 
uh spend six or seven hours with them and then come back 
and or she does the same thing she comes down here 
and we just do the one  
day thing now because of the children she worries about the children and blah blah blah 
it's better to stick 
home 
so i know what they're doing and everything but i don't 
i'm not 
the old fashioned grandmother 
um 
i'd like to be you know but she lives i keep telling her 
move down here but i'm not moving 
i don't like toledo 
uh 
i don't know actually probably if i went up there now i would like it but 
um 
but it's not that i it's i don't like it as well as columbus 
at all 
mainly i suppose because of the university 
uhhum 
i've given you plenty of opinions haven't i 
i've just loaded them on you 
okay 
i 
i just have a question 
is 
do you 
is this a research project for a private organization or is it 
uh huh 
uhhum 
okay 
i bet i will go home and i will wonder and wonder and wonder about this 
uhhum 
okay 

okay 
uhhum 
i'm originally from columbus 
i'm an event coordinator for 
which is  
excellent caterer 
in german village 
i'm 
forty three years old i've just been married uh 
three years i have no children 
uh 
i've lived in columbus most of my life although i have i went to school in atlanta 
and i also lived in orlando florida 
i used to have a uh interior plantscape business 
and that's why i moved to florida 
for 
so i'm really interested in 
horticulture interior design 
botany 
but when i did move back from columbus i was amazed with all the 
just in a five year span how 
much had grown and 
i think it's a really 
good city to live in i think it's really 
progressed well and 
i enjoy living here 
uh  
six years ago 
uhhum 
five years 
amazing how much the growth in delaware and different areas when 
i was growing up here and how marysville and it was such a farm 
town 
um just 
the growth of the 
different cities and suburbs of 
columbus is amazing and the 
housing and 
shopping 
you know 
but it's just become a really good 
metropolitan city i mean it's on it's way 
uhhum 
yep 
now with easton i think it's really helped 
with columbus and 
you know i think it's just gonna get better and better 
yeah 
yes 
uhhum 
columbus needs that as much people don't want other things to close i just feel we have to keep 
we have to grow those people have to travel so far to shop and 
you know 
i don't think that's 
really fair to them 
hm 
oh yeah that's beautiful 
yeah 
it's nice they have a real nice arts festival every spring 
if you ever get a chance go down in march 
it's right on their main 
street and  they have gorgeous 
really neat 
unique things 
uhhum it's real well known 
i lived i went actually went there for interior design i lived right off  street 
um 
right in there 
yeah 
and i had 
friends that lived in um 
buckhead 
where that nice mall is 
um 
some in 
smyrna which is outside ah atlanta but 
girls that i met through school and stuff 
uhhum 
yeah 
um 
growing up my father had restaurants 
and 
a couple private clubs 
and so i was always interested in the 
food industry but more 
with planning of the parties  
deciding 
you know what the client's needs are and 
uh i really like working in that aspect with 
you know nice 
and really creative  and 
nice because  
basically every job's usually different 
um i'm doing a function tonight for three hundred people 
for the ohio republican party and you know 
there's just needs for each thing that i do which makes it interesting 
oh yeah 
uhhum 
it's the biggest thing 
yes 
uhhum 
you know what 
um 
actually 
i don't believe they have anything booked so far lot of times i think this year people are more going out rather 
than having people come in to their homes and things 
i've usually i've worked for 
different hotels where i've always worked on new year's eve 
and my husband this year is like you know 
but we don't even have any plans 
were gonna maybe do 
with 
friends and they're going to california so i'm not sure 
even exactly what i'm gonna do but 
right now there's not an event scheduled 
which could change 
they are but the seems like they're going out 
yeah instead of having 
we don't do things in hotels and things because they have in house 
you know 
yes private homes and um actually 
where i worked there's not a facility 
for parties 
so because it's actually a market 
it's all done outside like tonight we're going to the uh galberth pavilion which is 
um 
next to the ohio theater 
it's really beautiful and people do a lot of parties there 
yeah 
yeah it is i like it 
i think 
yes 
especially 
season 
yep 
um we do office parties and 
you know everything 
like yesterday we had to go to an attorneys firm and 
fruit and cookies and you know i mean people tend to have food 
more and more 
you 
can't believe gourmet lunches and 
you know things 
lot more than they did let's say ten years 
yeah 
uhhum 
uh 
actually he 
um 
in the fifties he had a jazz club 
and 
um 
it was real popular 
it had food and live music um peggy lee sang 
and 
some kind of 
name 
people i wasn't around but 
um 
and also he had a private club that's um 
it was similar to the bunny club it was the key club where people had to pay a membership 
and it was in a real 
nice uh area downtown  
and he's  uh  um he's  
he's a broker 
he 
liquor licenses and things so 
he's owned several kinds of uh bars 
but originally he owned the um 
opened the topp steak house which is real popular in bexley 
um 
then 
sold it like three years later so 
mainly clubs and businesses but 
two really good restaurants 
yeah 
it is 
he is a commercial um heating and cooling 
technician 
he works for a major company out in indianapolis 
and he travels all over the state of 
he's from ohio 
i met him  
um 
the year i moved back from florida 
and he had just moved back from dallas 
he had lived there for ten years 
uh we met i was working at a restaurant  
short north 
and they were having a christmas party and his brother worked there and 
he brought 
my husband and i went there and that's how we met 
uhhum 
yeah 
and i was thirty nine 
well 
you know what 
my parents never did because 
um 
they knew i was always level headed 
i always 
a lot of boyfriends you know but i always 
i always felt like i was 
waiting for the right one 
and i had a few serious relationships but i just 
i never felt 
they were the right one 
and i did have a very serious relationship in florida 
uh he was quite a bit younger than i was and i knew 
he wanted children and i 
never wanted children unfortunately 
i 
i love 
animals and things but i just 
never decided i never wanted children and i knew 
he eventually would so 
uh 
i was engaged to him but i decide to 
break it off because i didn't think that was fair 
um 
i think anymore though with the 
women 
are more powerful and i think they they're finally making you know good money and 
used to be women needed men to take care of them 
and they weren't as 
much in the work force 
you know i think things have changed really 
in the last 
years 
you know in the 
yes 
you know there was definitely a point in my life where i was like oh am i ever gonna meet anybody and 
all my friends honestly 
most of them were all 
but um 
i enjoyed being single 
and i never really felt the 
the urge just to get married to get married 
and i'm i'm glad of that 
yeah 
yeah 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
neither was i 
i really wasn't 
and 
um 
it's funny i just 
this summer went to my twenty fifth 
uh high school reunion 
and there were several couples who got married 
right after high school 
i think there was probably f 
i will say six 
and amazingly 
uh 
well 
three were still together 
um 
and it was nice uh 
just seeing that and you could tell they were still in love and everything and 
you know 
one of them had four children one had like six you know i mean it was amazing because i thought i bet they're not still married 
getting right out of high school i just wasn't interested in that when i was in high school at all 
you know i was ready to go out into the world 
and these girls who get married so young they just have no clue about life 
you know 
you know i think a lot of it depends on 
i don't know if it's different parts of the country but cultures and everything 
because you know 
it just seems in 
ah some parts of the midwest but maybe 
kentucky and west virginia seems girls down there 
a lot them get 
married so young they just that's just 
what they want to do 
you know they don't but they're not thinking 
of any future 
wanting to go to college or anything like that 
have to cough is that okay 
i'm sorry 
i didn't want 
be like 
you will you will know it's me by the cough 
um 
no 
i have a beautiful niece i love her to death 
um 
i knew at a young age 
and actually 
wanted to 
make it a permanent decision but doctors at that time wouldn't do it i was like twenty five and i knew 
no they wouldn't even consider it they said you will change your mind 
and i knew i just never felt a mother instinct 
and it's 
funny 
uh yesterday actually last night we went to visit a friend of ours had a baby 
yesterday 
two days ago 
and when we left the room and she has a two year old child and now another 
little girl 
um i said derek you know 
it's 
it's nice to go in there and see that 
but i just have no 
motherly instinct 
towards 
you know they're all like oh eric you should have one and you know and he knows 
um 
i just knew at a young age i've always loved the animals 
and i 
it just i know it sounds crazy but i'd rather have ten animals and take care of them and different kinds of animals 
than children i don't know why 
i knew at a very young age 
that i 
wasn't important to me it wouldn't be a part of my life 
they wouldn't 
no 
i 
went to two different 
doctors and they said 
you possibly will change your mind and 
you know i was single 
um maybe if i would have been married they might have 
considered it 
um 
but 
they 
said no way would they do it 
and we're talking fifteen years ago 
yeah 
isn't that amazing 
yeah 
right 
well it probably would have been 
yeah 
but they felt that i would change 
and uh 
i've also been a vegetarian for twenty two years 
and when i first decided to do that everyone said oh you will 
change wait until you get married you will 
you know and i don't eat any animals at all 
um 
and it's 
it was just a conscious 
um 
decision 
i'm 
i never liked meat my parents always made me eat it once i went away to college 
and i said i'm i'm not going to eat anymore and they're like oh 
well we will see 
and 
i've never eat 
eaten 
anything since 
and 
i've always felt good about it 
but 
people always said 
oh you don't even crave you know what like a wendy's hamburger and all this stuff 
and once you make a decision like that you don't crave things like that you don't even 
think about it 
um 
and i you know they said well what if uh 
for health reason they said you'd have to eat meat there's no way someone could tell me 
that i would have to eat meat 
you know 
to make me healthier or whatever because i've always been really healthy 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
right 
there is 
there didn't used to be and especially in restaurants and everything and now it's such an open market and they know that they have to 
accommodate 
every 
um 
body's taste 
you know i mean before no i'd have to go in to a restaurant and 
salad and baked potato you know i mean there was nothing 
really nothing unless i go to a buffet and then all the 
food's so cooked down i mean honestly 
you know it's like no nutritional value 
but um 
no i knew i wouldn't change my mind on that either i'm pretty 
strong willed about 
oh yeah 
and you know what i cook meat for my husband 
i really don't cook 
red meat 
because he's on the road with his job and i know he stops at fast food places 
um but i cook him chicken and pork and i make soups 
a lot of good soups for him with meat 
and it really doesn't bother me to cook it 
you know i'm not go sit home make a roast every night 
but um 
and he's limited his meat a little bit more but with men it's a lot harder 
i think 
you know when they're 
used to you 
meat and potato kind of families 
um 
but like thanksgiving it just doesn't mean that much to me 
i 
i the family thing does but you know the turkey 
we i don't cook it very often my sister we used to go to my sister's 
house 
because she enjoys cooking and 
makes it a little bit easier i tend to overcook the meat 
you know i haven't 
yeah 
i haven't tried that 
no 
no i eat tofu a little bit but not really that much and i probably  
should i've 
um 
tended to more to soy products 
and there's so much nutritional value and especially for women 
you know i think it's 
really 
uhhum 
i think it's really good for women to learn about this we should have known about this twenty years ago 
all these women 
i know 
uhhum 
uhhum 
right 
right 
uhhum 
and they should 
and very rarely do doctors even ask you about allergies 
and i 
more and more and people don't even realize and they get sick so often 
they need to ask about allergies 
or even just have a little minor test that they can take 
when people when they can't figure out what's wrong with them 
because a lot of times it is allergic reactions to things they've eaten 
or been around 
you know but um 
more 
i think doctors should more 
look on that avenue 
you know 
that possibly it's something else like that 
i've never had a doc well now with the forms you fill out with your physicians and they ask you 
if you know about allergies and usually it's um 
prescriptions and things 
you know i mean that you've taken but 
they 
i don't know i think a lot of things have to do with food allergies anymore 
i really do 
yep 
well for so long i 
ate peanuts and i loved them and peanut butter and then two years ago i started getting a reaction from it 
and 
um 
finally i did go to the doctor because i 
i 
i was so ill from it 
um and he said you're allergic 
um 
mainly it was the skins on 
like spanish peanuts and things 
and i never but 
my body must have built up 
this reaction to it because i i was always fine eating them 
and then they really 
turned on me so now i can't even eat 
any 
peanut products 
or the oil because everybody's like well you can eat natural peanut butter and i'm like 
no it's the oil in there you know they grind up the peanuts and it's the oil 
but 
um 
i probably had it for a long time and i was 
getting sick and thinking i had the flu or something and he 
you know i didn't realize because i used to love peanut butter 
you want toast and crackers i'd go home you know was 
because it was a lot of protein for me not eating meat and it 
you know it kind of satisfied me 
but um 
this doctor 
took a couple tests 
and um 
he realized it was the peanuts which i would have never thought of that 
because i ate it for so long 
all my life 
yes 
uhhum 
see and i can't eat seafood 
but i 
tried some once when i went to las vegas with my 
and 
i 
we didn't really have it 
my mom didn't cook it at home 
which i'm kind glad she didn't 
um 
the 
smell of fish always kind of bothered me 
but 
until i tried some crab meat and lobster 
and within five minutes 
i broke out into a rash 
i mean it was like a heat rash 
oh 
it started on my neck 
is it okay i'm sorry 
it started on my neck and went down 
but it was 
automatic 
and i mean they had to take me the emergency room i didn't know what it was until 
it was 
and i mean you get so hot and you 
you just 
you're in a fever 
so i haven't been able to eat that but 
luckily my husband he's allergic too 

it's salt water fish 
he can eat fresh water 
um but no see and i would have never 
you know 
you don't know until you get a reaction like that 
no i had a cat that just died 
yeah 
sixteen 
yeah 
uhhum 
wow 
uh 
yeah 
um 
yeah 
uh we're planning on moving 
in the spring 
and i'm hoping to get  
i'm gonna get a puppy and a kitten together 
we want a dog and we've kinda been waiting 
um 
but i like both animals 
i like seeing them grow up together and 
i love kittens and 
you know i 
but i'm gonna wait 
we're not sure um 
we're looking to 
uh we rent now and we're looking to buy house 
probably 
um 
northwest area 
actually 
i live in clintonville now and it's real convenient but 
the houses are so old and 
i'm just tired of living in an old 
they're nice but 
uhhum 
yeah 
right 
uhhum 
that's perfect 
uhhum 
oh 
uhhum 
see that's how my husband was they didn't have a pet growing up 
and i just can't imagine i had dogs and cats 
we did and i loved it 
and 
i just think kids need that and it's just 
a different kind of love i think 
you know they learn from it and 
you look forward to coming home you know and the pets waiting 
right 
right 
hm 
yeah 
hm 
that's great 
yeah 
uhhum 
oh is he 
well my husband was allergic when 
we first got together but i hafta admit 
um 
it's 
it's 
they well he went 
he goes to 
he has other allergies 
um 
so he gets shots and things but 
you know they always say it's the pet dander 
and 
uh eventually he 
he was alright with it 
he got used to it 
um 
i've always heard and i'm 
i'm very clean anyways but you know when you hafta vacuum a lot and everything and you're constantly picking up that dander rather than just let it sit and accumulate 
um 
but they always say don't let the animals sleep with you and all that and with a cat and they curl up with you 
it's hard to say 
no but you know what 
honestly 
eventually 
well it it took probably a year 
he stopped sneezing 
you know he did sneeze but he knew i wasn't gonna get rid the cat i'd had her she was my daughter 
and so 
eventually he did he's 
and 
he just got used to her 
and he always said well i'm so allergic but 
but then he didn't have any problems uhhum 
now when he goes to my sister's house and she 
has three cats and he's not around 
them 
then when we leave his eyes are itching and 
you know 
i mean so it is true 
um 
with different 
pets 
but 
yes 
you're right 
uhhum 
oh i'm sure 
no 
yeah 
we have that many animals you know people 
yeah 
it is but 
see i've always i 
i have one floors where i live now i vacuum them i mean i'm just the type you know i didn't want 
pet hair and 
things you know 
collecting but 
it's hard 
with my sister's cats because she has a little girl and no she didn't go home and vacuum every day 
you know 
but um 
i think when you have 
pets you hafta make a little bit more effort 
yeah 
we both love sports 
um 
we love 
college football 
we come as many games 
as we can 
um 
uh we both golf 
and um 
like hiking swimming 
uh 
every year we usually go on a trip this year we went to new mexico we were thinking about moving out there 
um 
it's really beautiful out there 
we like 
we like mountains and 
you know walking around uh we got married in lake tahoe which is really beautiful 
it's beautiful 
and 
we like going to see the ski resorts everything i don't really ski 
um 
i do more 
summer sports 
but um 
he's just beginning on the computer 
um 
i'm pretty computer illiterate i've really never had a job yet it's always been 
working with food or plants 
um 
so he's 
he's learning about the computer now it's gonna be kind of a hobby 
least it's not a work thing but i know we can do 
lot of things for our house 
you know with the computer and everything 
um 
he's uh 
he's a really good handyman he can do anything so he's really helped me he 
he's really into 
design and stuff so he likes to paint 
and um 
you know he's really open 
he's learned a lot about gardening 
for me 
and you know that's one of my main things is gardening and 
flowers and 
i know 
i know 
i am 
i can't wait because i 
the house we live in 
it's a half double with 
we had a front porch and a deck which 
i really decked out but 
you know 
i have like eighty plants my house now but 
i just can't wait to have my own space i never 
plant anything in the ground there because i thought well i'm going to leave you know 
i just didn't wanna do that a lot of people do that but you know 
it's just such an investment then when you leave and 
but um 
i really enjoy that 
wow that's great 
uhhum 
oh they're beautiful 
uhhum 
oh 
yes 
but that's great though 
uhhum 
yeah 
uhhum 
well that's great 
yeah 
definitely 
i 
yes 
yep 
uhhum 
i don't know 
you know columbus is so saturated with golf courses and my parents all through growing up 
they played golf and 
i really was interested in it 
um 
i just think enoughs enough so 
i 
yeah 
there's so many but 
i have to admit  
when we go to try play golf sometimes 
and not have a tee 
time you can't even get in 
so all over columbus they're all booked 
and so you keep thinking well 
you know they need more but 
i was hoping they could use that land for something else 
i don't know 
there's 
you know there's so many 
not building but 
you know something maybe 
especially in dublin 
but 
it's   probably it will be good for columbus 
because i 
they feel they 
have the need for it 
there's so many golfers i mean that sports 
went sky high 
mean when  
my mom used to play golf 
growing up and they only let them on 
just one day a week 
which is amazing 
was like on a tuesday 
and when i lived in florida a lot of the courses were like that too and i thought 
they're only allowing women one day a week 
you know 
isn't that amazing 
there's so many good women golfers now and but they said they're too slow and they always talk and 
and that just killed me when my mom that's the only day she could play and she wanted to play more 
so things have come a little bit 
you know 
better but um 
there's still such restrictions with women 
you know in this sport especially i think golf 
uhhum 
right 
right 
you can't 
no 
uhhum 
right 
it is 
but it it that was good for 
new albany to have that i mean i think it 
it was great to have it there and i think a lot of people 
um 
did enjoy going there because there's not very many women tournaments that come 
around here 
yeah 

yes 
mmhmm 
yep 
no 
mmhmm 
right 
yep 
oh 
wow 
uhhum 
wow 
yeah 
no i  we actually had student tickets that 
people didn't want clear up in c deck 
um 
but we enjoy it because  lot times we walk and 
um 
i think i was at that penn state game i have a 
is a golf pro over 
near 
penn state 
trying think the name of it 
um 
but he usually gets us tickets for that game 
yeah 
mmhmm but i've never been to happy valley i've always 
wanted to go i've heard it's so nice 
and you  
they're such good people every time they come here to ohio state though they were very 
you know high class people and 
a year that we just 
killed them here i think it was 
three years ago and but they were 
you know i mean though 
they just seem very gracious because 
i think their coach is the best joe paterno is the best 
i do he's a 
he is 
he is 
mmhmm 
john no 
he he's a very he's a disappointment 
and 
i 
think the 
problem with this year was the coaching it's good that they got rid of two c a h s but 
his attitude i just don't think the kids 
think of him as a role model and i think a coach has to be a role model 
i used to work at the hyatt 
on capitol square 
and that's where 
the ohio state players 
i don't know if you know this 
they stay there every night before a game 
i mean it's the most expensive hotel in columbus 
all the players stay there but 
to my amazement they come down for a uh 
i think they have a dinner then they come down for a midnight snack it's so funny all these guys come down in their shorts and stuff 
to get bags of apples and chicken sandwiches and apple juice 
but 
but then here comes 
the 
uh cooper's wife 
and his daughter 
and like his son and i'm 
they're putting  
all these his family up in this hotel the 
before a game i mean 
i don't know i just thought it was very strange that he would have his whole family staying there with him when 
all 
none of those boys get to bring anybody you know what i mean 
and none of the other c a h s did either 
um 
but i just thought it and here they came down for the midnight snack too 
and i thought 
this is for the 
team 
you know what i mean 
i thought it was very strange 
but um 
he seems pretty arrogant i don't think he's done 
very 
too much for columbus 
they need to get a younger coach they need 
a new 
they do 
because he just 
he's all out for 
i just really think he is 
yeah 
i know it 
and then the players said we're not getting any guidance from the c a h s 
you know and they some of them 
spoke out where they should speak out 
you know 
mean i liked earl bruce 
and i uh waited on him a couple times at a restaurant i worked at 
he was the nicest man and when they did that i don't know if you know about that when they 
fired him the day before the michigan game 
for having a nine to three season three years in a row 
they fired him the day before that game 
and then but the whole band and the cheerleaders went to his house 
and he came out crying i mean it was on tv it was like heart wrenching 
and because of that 
the um 
um 
athletic director that was here at the time 
he quit 
because he did not want to fire them and they overruled him 
but 
the city just could not believe 
that they fired him like that the night before the 
michigan game 
so then the next day he came out on the field with a black suit and a fedora you know a hat 
he looked so cool 
you know because joe paterno he always wears a tie i don't know he just 
he he's a great coach 
you know not that what you wear makes you but he just 
he's a good role model 
cooper just 
i just don't see him ever 
hugging the guys or saying great job or anything 
you know i  
right 
yeah 
uhhum 
well the main thing is 
they never leave 
they don't they go a lot of them through their senior year and graduate ohio state has the lowest 
g p a of any college 
i mean that is an 
that is an embarrassment for a college this size 
and they have excellent 
professors and everything 
but i think 
you know they get a lot of these kids and they don't care about school 
but they 
they leave early 
because they know they can do it 
and that's so sad for our city 
it really is 
you know 
uhhum 
uhhum 
oh yeah 
and these guys have a free ride and then they just leave on it 
i know 
i think they should too 
i do 
i 
do 
i mean 
and you're right that's not fair because then that's 
that's a waste 
um because there is some good athletes you look at colleges especially on the west coast like stamford i have a friend who's 
from california 
his dad's a 
um 
a graduate of stanford 
um 
but he is um 
they they never leave there i mean that's an excellent medical school and everything but those football players they're smart they they don't 
they don't quit 
you know 
i mean it's amazing they 
they never do 
because they like it they like school and that's why they came to college football was secondary 
but here 
it's just to see you know 
how much 
success you can have and then 
they just want to leave 
but 
we looked we can look forward to the basketball season i think he's a good coach 
we needed that 
uhhum 
yeah that was very exciting 
uhhum 
yeah i think it was 
right 
uhhum 
yeah 
i know 
well because 
you know 
but then they have one injury 
and then 
what are they going to do 
and they got to think of that 
they have a free 
education and they just don't think of it that way 
you know they think they can make enough money 
but 
you know 
money's not everything 
it's too bad sports have 
ended up this way 
it does 
uhhum 
uhhum 
i know 
uhhum 
well 
i think all through growing up there's always been 
you know 
different kind of kids 
i mean there's always been the nerds and 
um 
i don't know when i was growing up 
in the seventies 
there really wasn't 
punk or anything like that 
and 
i think um 
unfortunately 
i mean there's always going to be all different kinds of people 
to make the world but 
it they just 
pushed you to an extreme 
certain 
kinds of kids and you know 
they want a 
i saw 
you know i watch all these shows dateline and twenty twenty and all this informative shows 
and how one was 
in texas run over 
one of the punk kids was run over by a 
um 
a jock 
i mean actually run over and killed 
um in a fight 
and they just said that we wanna be 
um 
looked at as just 
other 
kids you know in high school 
but yet when they wear make up and they spike their hair 
and they have all these piercings 
you know it's like they  
they don't want to be like everybody else 
you know they want to be judged as like everybody else 
but 
you know i think um 
they have so many different ideas 
and not that either one of them's right but still um 
i 
i think there's always going to barrier there 
they're just kids are just not all kids are going to get along 
you know 
i mean 
i think because 
of the movies 
and i think of 
nintendo and all those games that they have on there i think that really does 
spark things in little 
children's minds and even you know like in junior high that oh yeah we could do that 
you know and 
there's just so much violence 
in 
when we were growing up there wasn't any violence 
on tv we weren't allowed to watch it 
but you know i mean i 
the comics weren't violent 
um 
now it's too open for kids 
the parents 
you know they say the parents should monitor 
them 

on tv and in the movies 
that 
that is what's making the 
these kids think they 
they can do it 
i just really think 
i think it's too late 
i do 
i 
personally i think it's too late 
because 
they can get things on the internet 
you know there's just so many things 
so many 
avenues for them 
to 
find 
violence and pornography and you know  
things that 
we 
you know 
when i was growing up 
we just 
there was no way i could 
see any of that stuff i had good parents but i 
i was in to 
you know 
lassie and tom and jerry i mean you know these but you know they weren't violent and they made you feel good after you watched them but  
i just think 
i don't think it could 
turn back 
right now 
i don't know 
there's just too much diversity 
in the world 
and too much prejudice 
there really is still and it's sad but 
it there really is 
yep 
i do 
i really do 
i mean these kids are getting guns a lot of thems from their parents but 
um 
it's amazing how many guns and they say that 
the police are selling guns 
to people and they don't realize 
you know their old guns that they confiscate and they don't realize where they're going i mean that amazes me 
um 
but there's always gonna be 
the underworld and 
different 
ways that kids and people can get guns 
and it's sad i don't know how we could ever 
limit that but 
there's so many millions of 
guns in the world that 
you know 
you're wondering where are they all coming from 
um 
i think 
but i think laws can help especially with children and they have these new 
guns that 
um 
not just a safety lock but 
you know you 
it's like identification thing 
you know 
only the  can do it i mean 
seems like with all the technology in the world they should be able to do something like that 
the people who have guns and 
in their home and not have them 
locked up or in a 
you know in a 
place that no child could find it 
they're to blame 
they are they're to blame 
um 
that whole thing with the um 
school out in colorado 
um 
i forget the name of it but 
yeah 
but when they said that those boys were making those guns in the garage and the parents didn't 
were clueless i just find that really hard to believe 
if a child goes in to a garage every night and you hear clanging and 
and they're buying gun metal and 
you know 
then they were totally 
um 
not in tune with what their kids were doing 
it's one thing them having a site on the internet 
it's another thing that they're in their own 
in the house where the parents are every night 
and not going in to the garage and finding things 
i just can't believe and they said they didn't even know what was going on 
it is 
um 
i do because they weren't 
you know they weren't 
in their 
children's lives enough 
you know they weren't talking about things being open about things at dinner 
you know finding out about school 
um 
i  you can't blame them for having a site on the internet not too many 
parents would know that that they their kids you know 
um 
but no i think i i i put the blame on the parents 
i do i think 
they 
you know if you're open with your kids nowadays you have to be with 
everything that's in the world 
mean my parents never talked to me about drugs or anything 
and it was just when 
the drug culture was just 
you know starting we learned about it in school and stuff but no my parents never sat down with me 
or about smoking i mean i never really smoked but 
today with teenagers and everything so out in the open 
you have to talk to them about things and just say 
you know 
i want to help you and i 
you know be there for them a hundred percent obviously 
those parents were to busy with their own lives to realize what their children were doing 
so i think they're the ones to be 
to blame i do 
yeah 
not that they could have stopped it but they 
they should have known what was going on 
uh i really think 
if they were close with their children they would have known 
something was wrong 
especially with these kids 
here are so removed and 
don't talk to their parents and start dressing 
certain ways 
you know that they're 
you know going a 
turning a different 
you know 
i just 
i blame them though 
uhhum 
but they lived in a beautiful home 
i mean if you're to 
i mean 
kids like that i could see 
if they're 
in a 
poor in harlem or whatever 
but these kids lived in a nice neighborhood in a beautiful home in colorado i mean you know 
i just think they were 
removed from what their children 
or their son was doing 
totally 
yeah 
i don't think that though you know women need to work 
and 
most families do need two incomes 
um 
and 
plus when kids go into high school 
you know you have 
pardon me you have to worry about them but 
you know you 
you have to let them experience some of life 
on their own 
that's a big growing period you know from junior high to high school is when you really 
learn and try to decide what you want to do with your life 
um 
my mother was always home she was 
um 
which was good to come home to because i had friends 
whose parent mothers weren't there and they had to clean and they had to start dinner and they hated it you know i mean and they 
feel that they kind of 
missed out on things 
um 
but 
i think 
you know kids 
lot of them who have 
when they 
parents have money 
and um 
both parents worked i'm not sure if the columbine 
if both parents worked but 
i don't think 
just the mother being home there 
would have totally helped 
no 
uhhum 
uhhum 
well 
i don't think they should be responsible i think 
um 
kids go to school 
and they need role models good teachers 
um 
and i think schools have gotten a lot 
better about that it seemed like in the 
late eighties early nineties you know the schools 
a lot of them were really bad 
um 
i think 
finally 
the education 
department or whatever is 
realizing that 
parents need help with their kids they can't 
do everything and 
you know they just need really positive things when they do go to school 
and 
you know i think teachers are a big part of it 
i really do 
you know you remember when you have a good teacher and that you've learned a lot 
um and i think 
you know through education 
because it's hard all these schools in so many rural areas and everything 
try to get good teachers and then 
you know it's always have to do with money and them not 
making enough money which 
the teachers don't make enough money 
and they're overworked and all these big large classrooms 
and it just seems to me 
when kids start 
dressing and 
getting in a clique together 
you know would be hard for them to 
intervene and  say oh what's going on in your life what's your 
what's the problem you know that's 
that's not really 
should be their role 
but 
um 
if they care enough they should call the parents and say 
look we're worried about your son 
he misses lot of school or he's starting to dress really 
ynkow 
i 
sometimes and it shouldn't be that dress 
has a lot to do with it but it seems when kids 
go a different way 
it does involve dress 
and 
just 
you know 
turning against the norm of the society 
you know 
and if they don't want to be in sports that's fine there are so many different things they can do in 
in school and learn about arts and music and 
you know 
but 
um 
unfortunately a lot i think a lot more pressure is on schools 
to more or less pick up the slack 
of what 
the parents can't do 
but in some ways 
it's always kind of been like that i mean it was like you went to school and they took care of you until you got home 
you know 
i mean 
well 
right 
right 
i think it would help 
i do 
i am against religion in school 
i just don't think 
they should push that on people 
um 
you know 
i mean i don't think they should make people pray if they don't want to before class or anything you know like that 
but as far as morals and the right 
thing to do in life and 
what's out there and 
you know most kids know what the wrong thing is but 
um 
i think 
i think through education 
that's 
it's just gonna only help 
kids because a lot times maybe they don't get that at home 
so they're really looking 
to choose the right thing to do 
help 
i do 
i am against religion in school 
i just don't think 
they should push that on people 
um 
you know 
i mean i don't think they should make people pray if they don't want to before class or anything 
you know like that 
but as far as morals and the right 
thing to do in life and 
what's out there and 
you know most kids know what the wrong thing is but 
um 
i think 
i think through education 
that's 
it's just gonna 
only help 
kids because a lot times maybe they don't get that at home 
so they're really looking 
to choose the right thing to do 
and through school and  education 
that's their avenue to go there 
you know 
so unfortunately 
you know and i guess i never thought of it 
a lot more pressure is put on 
schools and education now 
you know 
and these schools that have a thousand people i just can't imagine 
i mean you know my my high school was like 
four hundred people and we 
thought that was 
big at the time 
and just to have a thousand  
excuse 
me people and 
just to 
try to monitor different things i mean it's gotta be so 
hard 
you know 
in checking everything and 
you know 
i just think it's sad even here in columbus you know like two weeks ago when they had these bomb scares in different high schools 
and i thought 
you know 
i just 
you know it just could because 
of all the things you've seen in the world 
in the last few year 
that these kids want to do this just to see 
what's gonna happen 
you know it's it's just sad 
in our society that that's what it's 
turning to 
i went to brook haven 
which is uh 
up on karl road 
near northland mall 
yep 
yes 
i do 
uhhum 
uhhum 
well 
honestly growing up 
we didn't have we 
it wasn't really called sex ed 
um 
they talked about the female reproductive system 
nothing about men which is kind of funny 
you know it was always the women 
and that chart you know 
and those 
tubes and all that i mean i remember seeing that like in eighth grade and looking that thinking that's me you know 
um 
but with 
kids and they're just so much 
more 
active at a early age 
you know and i hear about kids 
twelve  thirteen 
luckily i wasn't that early 
but um 
i think 
once they start 
you know like sixth grade they really 
should relate to them 
um 
i 
think that's too young to talk about birth control methods and everything but 
you know with aids and that as 
rampant it is is now and 
there are so many more women that have it 
um started off it was mostly men 
um 
women have got to know 
as  at an early age 
you know 
about these different diseases and things 
and i think that 
um 
the morals being 
you know 
especially 
at a young age you know abstinence is the best policy 
so many people 
i 
i 
think they are 
turning to they're not gonna 
have any 
thing 
do anything before they're married um 
but in today's life 
once you get in to college and stuff it's a little hard to 
but i think a lot more kids are going 
that route 
um 
because my 
parents never talked to me about sex 
we all learned it from our friends 
um 
my mother was very open 
but i think in today's world 
because really there wasn't 
there wasn't that many 
diseases 
i mean 
you know there was but 
you just didn't hear about it 
and the pregnancies and all the unwanted children and everything like that 
um 
i just heard this week that in france they have 
uh that morning after pill 
and you know i just really think they need to make that 
and not 
uh 
an option 
for a young girl 
i really do because there's just 
you know 
there's just too many unwanted children 
there just is and that really bothers me 
that we don't have another option 
like another 
country 
um 
we're a lot more right wing here in america 
but 
i just feel that's got to be an option 
you know for these young girls 
it just really does 
right 
right 
well 
but i 
think it should be an option 
you know i'm really 
you know for women's right and everything because i was single for so long 
and 
i just feel 
if a man could have a child 
it would be different but since women are the only ones that can 
then it's 
ultimate 
ultimately should be our choice 
i really do 
and i think 
you know we should have every option available 
especially when you're young 
no girl should have to go through 
you know 
pregnancy and everything even if it's a mistake or whatever i just 
you know 
it ruins their lives 
when they don't have the option 
right 
well 
i think at that age the 
parents should be involved 
and hopefully they will be open minded enough to know that this is going to be something she's going to have the rest of her life 
um 
i will tell you what with today's 
world 
and some of these fourteen year olds 
that look like they're twenty 
and 
you know 
they 
they know what they're doing 
and no they shouldn't keep 
repeating that 
um 
i just think 
the most important thing is is for them to be able to have the option 
i really do 
but yes the parents should be involved i'd say to the age 
seventeen maybe 
you know i 
think they should have a 
parent's consent and hopefully 
the parents will love their daughter enough to realize 
what a 
mistake it's going to be if 
she's gonna be young mother and then 
eventually maybe not even want to be a mother 
you know 
i mean 
there's a lot of girls that have those babies and then they just 
they kill them 
you know and there's so much that 
for a while there that was going on and it's like you 
i can't believe these women are doing this 
you know 
they just snap 
well 
i will be honest 
i have a lot of homosexual friends 
and 
being in the restaurant business and 
growing up in the restaurant business and that's how i 
really kind of 
met them 
when i was going to school i didn't know any 
and i went to o u and honestly down there i didn't know 
i didn't know anybody was gay 
um 
i feel 
that 
a lot of people were i will say 
most of them 
or all of them 
are born that way 
some of them do make a choice 
um 
but i 
feel that 
it should be 
talked about in school 
um for so long 
it was in the closet 
you know they didn't talk about it and these kids you know 
had to hide it and i just think in today's world and there's so many people that are openly gay 
that 
it should be talked about more in school 
i do 
i think 
you know 
especially 
i just think some 
and women 
there's 
women that 
you know i had 
my gym teacher brook haven now that i look at it 
i didn't know then 
but she was gay 
i mean we didn't 
i didn't think that then i don't know why but she was very manly but she was very 
she was very good but she was 
you know just 
not 
feminine at all 
and not that that changed my opinion of her 
um 
but 
back then and nobody would talk about it 
and 
you know 
i just think 
in today's world 
we need to bring 
subjects like that out 
no one 
because there's so many people who are ashamed about 
things 
and they shouldn't be ashamed because it's a lifestyle anymore 
you know 
i just 
it needs to be brought up more 
yeah 
well 
uhhum 
well 
but see i think if you 
really try to tell 
kids and especially women 
that 
you know you shouldn't 
sex is something that 
should be between two people that love each other 
and unless you really 
feel love and really 
think 
it is love then 
you know 
you shouldn't do it 
um i know that's a lot easier said than done 
because 
you fall in love every other week sometimes when you're young 
um 
but i don't think it encourages it 
i just think in 
you know they show so much on t v it's all you know people are 
nude on at ten o clock at night on these shows 
and these girls are watching it 
i mean granted most of them are adults 
but on the soap operas and stuff it's a different story 
so they're seeing it anyways 
um 
you just i think if you're open enough with your children these parents 
and say you know we  
we want to give you this option we really 
prefer you don't do this but if you decide to do it we want you to be protected 
i mean i think that's the best way to 
address it 
and as far as the homosexual i think there is kids who 
say well maybe i'm gay i don't know if i'm gay or what 
well 
hopefully 
they will know 
their true identity 
eventually 
i mean yes some people 

um 
you just i think if you're open enough with your children these parents 
and say you know we  
we want to give you this option we really prefer you don't do this 
but if you decide to do it we want you to be protected 
i mean i think that's the best way to 
address it 
and as far as the homosexual i think there is kids who 
say well maybe i'm gay i don't know if i'm gay or what 
well 
hopefully 
they will know 
their true identity 
eventually 
i mean yes some people 
i mean i know men 
several men who got married had children and then they 
decided they were gay 
okay were they gay before but they did like women 
you know and they did want the children 
and now 
they live 
in gay relationships 
but they said all along 
they were gay 
they just fought it 
and they they didn't want the pressure from their families 
so 
ah 
you know 
i 
i just think the more you're open about things 
i just think that's the best why it 
you know 
when you put things and don't talk about it that's when the problems start 
but i think kids in high school and stuff 
some of them 
like 
my brother in law is gay 
and 
when i met him i knew he was i 
you know 
he was the type 
some of them you can't tell well it doesn't matter what they look like 
um 
but my husband said all through growing up 
he liked men 
he didn't like girls 
he looked at 
you know all this stuff 
and i thought that's so funny because growing up i just didn't know 
know anybody that was 
um but 
you know he was openly gay to his mother right from the beginning 
and 
she was from germany which made it a little tough because 
you know they didn't talk about 
those things 
over there at all 
for a long time 
but um 
then she became very open with him and every but everybody knew 
and that was in the eighties 
and 
you know 
if some kids know it when they're young and growing up 
you know i don't know if it's best to not say it or to 
you know 
be open but if they're open to their parents about it 
then their parents are going to deal with it a lot better then 
than if they wait 
later on in their life 
you know 
but some of sometimes i guess they change 
you know 
most the men i knew 
right off the bat 
know i mean i mean it was it 
and it was all through their life it wasn't as though they just said oh 
i'm  
i'm going be gay 
so 
i just 
with that terrible thing that happened  
montana 
with that boy 
and just just shows the ignorance in so many people 
it's at that really still bothers me that 
there's there is 
still so much of that going on 
you know 
it was 
it is 
uhhum 
uhhum 
it does 
yeah they have the gay pride parade and everything which is good they should be able to 
yes 
well 
yes 
but you know what his parents are gonna 
you know really going to let people know that 
this just can't go on not that they're going to stop it totally 
but it made 
a lot of people more aware 
that it's still really going on 
you know and his parents accepted him 
which 
they have to 
you can't 
you can't be 
mad at somebody for choosing a lifestyle 
you just can't life's too short 
you know 
i mean 
you can love them either way it doesn't make any difference 
they did 
i think so 
uhhum 
right 
right 
that is 
no i don't either because i believe in the death penalty and i feel 
taking a life like that leaving someone there just to die 
tied up to a fence 
you know 
i think they deserve to die 
because 
with the 
prisons and the overcrowding that's a whole another subject 
you know that 
it's just amazing to me so many people are in there that 
should be dead 
i feel 
because 
we're just paying for them to 
live in there 
but um 
yeah 

you want my name now 
okay  
uh hum 
and you're not being recorded now 
oh you are 
i don't see a microphone in front of you that's what i was wondering 
okay 
okay 
all right 
alright 
very good 
we're up here in the attic and 
the ink's freezing up on us 
who is gonna witness this now there's no one here 
oh 
hum 
whereabouts upstate 
watertown waterbury 
watertown 
well after graduating from the state 
uh 
i've been here 
thirty some years 
and employed now with the 
transportation department 
i started out in the finance area 
with the 
as an  
and then when divesture of the bell system occurred in the country 
uh i was drafted to 
head up and develop a uh telecommunications section within o dot 
and so currently uh 
uh 
i'm 
i used to be the manager of telecommunications of o dot but now i'm a 
the special project coordinator 
for telecommunications at o dot 
and in addition i'm a 
a cruise agent 
in preparation for retirement 
so i've been working on that 
and i got my  um 
accredited affiliation with the 
cruise line international here this last year 
and so i'm ready to go cruising 
okay 
i have two  
two um students 
my one she's twenty six two 
two 
children 
one's a student here currently 
and uh the other one is um 
a uh working cuff at the 
steubenville ohio 
uh 
cuff is uh 
catholics united for the faith 
it's um 
she had to go up and graduate from miami university of ohio and got affiliated with uh 
campus crusade for christ and so forth and went out to dekalb in 
working for northern illinois 
then went back working for the inner city area of chicago 
and found herself 
that she liked steubenville better 
and when i relocated her 
people would say you're crazy young lady you're twenty five and you're moving to steubenville 
they're migrating out of here 
but uh 
she likes the spirituality of the community over there 
and 
i think this past year they had two 
murders over there 
and it was publicized in the columbus area but uh 
it should 
this 
yes 
and they had the strong uh public uh support over there it's a really is 
tight knit community it's uh quite different 
columbus needs to learn a lot from that area 
and uh 
it's a matter of just uh putting in i guess your hands in the 
your  
practicing your faith 
which we 
well i  i 
i think we  we 
oh yeah we're we're church goers but just be going church goers isn't uh isn't being faithful 
i think it's just a 
sharing yourself uh 
with one another in daily lives 
uh listening to someone outreaching to someone 
whatever it might be 
that's the the ministry that uh i think our our our lord has given us 
the opportunity to serve one another 
and uh 
that's the downfall of our society because we're thinking more of ourself 
others 
and i think as  
as we become 
older 
you start thinking about 
how 
um much your weaknesses are but really your weaknesses are the strength that you pull from your faith 
it's not the materialistic things that the university here  
uh 
professes to be the thing 
cuff 
yes 
i am and 
they are the 
my wife wasn't 
uhhum 
he's in his sophomore year 
i have no idea 
you know 
no it it's in uh it's in the ag 
college but uh 
why it's there i don't know 
it's a matter 
of how 
they fit it in there but 
it's dealing with construction management 
north 
oh projects were 
right from infancy were 
i was designing 
the project 
first of all we had to find out what we had 
with the vesture and 
uh as everyone should know even as a residential user you have to know what you have in your house 
the telephone company doesn't 
provide the service to you anymore 
well we had to know what we had through out the state of ohio 
and some 
eighty eight counties and uh wherever else number of facilities we had 
and so we went on a scavenger hunt 
basically 
because the plans which the utilities had 
for our locations they could not provide to us because of the uh 
the vesture ruling 
so we had to go out and um 
do our own surveys 
become self educated through uh courses uh through a t t and through purdue university it was i think o u had some courses 
and um 
ultimately the university here now has i think a major in telecommunication group 
but uh 
the projects basically we were going from a um 
putting together a network itself 
and uh we had a 
you think of a party line system what they used call daisy chain 
in the industry 
uh you had to wait and wait for your turn to get on to 
a data network 
and 
we got down to point where 
we went to a 
spoke network where everyone had dedicated pipe 
to the hub 
um which course eliminated down time 
but with um 
that we were 
not in a position to monitor traffic 
and telecommunications is very much like a highway 
you need to know what your load's going to be before you construct it or vice you know 
otherwise your planning's way off 
well 
nowadays we're in a position where we're doing 
more advancement than anything our agency is the only one in the state of ohio 
and the private network 
uh as a private sector is still looking as  looking at us 
as a showcase 
we're doing voice 
over i p internet 
internet protocol 
which means we're doing voice and data over the same pipe 
and the long line carriers 
they don't even know how to bill us 
and i think there's an article this last wednesday in the dispatch in business section as to 
how 
the p u c o can't regulate it and because of it they want to deregulate telecommunications 
uh and so for the past 
months we haven't been getting telephone bills 
for usage 
we have the backbone we're paying for 
and what's going to happen out of this whole thing is 
it offers us a a 
a a lot of latitude where 
with uh 
we can  now 
um 
if we have a contractor lets say over in dayton 
and we're calling from zanesville 
office 
i'd rather make them long distance we can go on our pipe 
and if we have a line going over dayton 
we can make that call as if it's a local call 
avoiding all long distance 
okay 
so our backbone still there but 
ultimately 
as we get traffic uh measurements 
we will be able to downsize the number of pipes we have 
so streamlining our network 
and uh 
i said our our engineers they're not engineers 
per se 
but they are techies that are really in to this they they enjoy their work and 
it's for 
it's in the forefront 
of ohio government 
along with the technology 
there has to also be the paperwork 
now i know realize we have 
a paperless environment 
quote unquote 
but we still need to have property manager records that's very essential and a lot times when you're talking to engineers they don't 
realize that part of it 
um they don't like the detail 
at least 
that aspect of it 
uh but we need to have a lot of that because you need know how 
uh your uh 
facilities are structured 
uh the time history 
any type of uh 
activity on that whether it's been uh installed 
removed 
relocated 
whatever might be 
but we need know that how it had an impact upon the design of a the particular 
uh facility voice and data 

so that's basically what 
we've been doing we've been progressing for fifteen years 
and um 
i'm proud to say that our state agency is probably the only agency other than maybe this 
highway patrol 
we work a lot with them 
but i think our we're the only ones that have their own wiring cable people 
and 
the administrators for telecommunications for the state of ohio 
are 
working with us as observers because they don't have a staff 
and um 
it it's great 
we've been reengineered last eight years o dot downsizing 
and trying to fit the uh 
uh fit the i guess the attributes the person brings to work 
as opposed to 
not 
one of the problems i  i see as an 
as an employer or  as a supervisor 
manager 
a lot of times we have to promote 
because 
well 
the bureaucracy says you have to 
do this in order to get up there 
they don't take in consideration the attributes the person  and so now we're saying okay if you bring this attribute to the table 
and you can help the team  
then why not reward  
instead of putting you over here in let's say a  position 
which you really don't have any 
for but you're there because the money only 
okay 
so we're trying to fit the attribute to the person compensate them accordingly 
which 
hey if 
i think we did that we'd probably have more teachers 
um 
but the  trouble is we don't fit the 
horse with the proper carriage load 
and we need to do that in our society we need to work as a  
there's no sense in having  
having five guards on a basketball team 
if you don't have a center that can tip it off and rebound 
but 
we go out and look uh we look do it differently in sports but we do this differently in the 
the uh secular world 
we should look at it as 
as a sport 
oh and that that's a problem in our society and if  if something can come out 
of the university here 
to  
the reverse of that 
i think you have 
a lot less psychological 
problems with people 
and domestic problems 
work problems 
everything 
because the 
problem comes down to the fact 
well gee it's not 
it's not recognized you know were 
trends in our society that say well you gotta be a 
you gotta be a 
computer guru 
you gotta be  
well before 
before 
gates was recognized 
he was nothing 
to our society 
now we he we bow to him 
but what tell what does it tell us about our people 
we're so  
we've got to look inside ourselves and say what can we bring to society that that that can be more beneficial 
and most the time 
it's 
listening 
not for long 
you consider the housing trends 
and there 
there again that goes back to the stupid consumer 
i say stupid consumer because 
when i was in college i always said well  consumer had a fourth grade education level 
and how 
how many dollars does a consumer put in to research as opposed to the business 
that's the inequity in our life 
you're you're basically putting the shaft to the consumer 
and 
until that consumer becomes on equal knowledge level as the 
it's always gonna be inequitable and you're gonna have a 
problem 
in our society because 
we don't need these large houses and so forth because as you progress in age 
it becomes a liability 
but then the developers are thinking well let's see well we can make 
downsize a little bit but still we want make this 
we want make this margin of  
yeah we do but what about for society's 
best interests 
well you used a word 
earlier in your statement 
what we  
we should buy 
yeah the retailer 
what we should buy 
and that's the 
we listen to 
business 
too  
if business 
reemphasized 
their goals to help society out and not themselves 
but you can  
you also 
grow with  
you can work with the community and still gain the respect from community and you will have allegiance but you know nowadays we don't have any   loyalty at all it's out the window 
uh and that's what i fear 
the most 
you're saying the internet 
yeah 
big deal you're going after 
what you want well maybe some people want low cost 
they don't want service okay 
boom 
disposable 
the problem we have in our society today because of one thing 
we're trying  
communicate as you say through the internet and through businesses 
but we don't have 
and we don't have commitment 
without those  
you will never have success 
well i think it starts 
with the family 
but the problem is in the last thirty years we've emphasized 
uh not i shouldn't say thirty years 
post 
world war two 
post world war two is where we broke the family up 
and let me tell you how i 
i analyze this 
during world war two we took the little lady out of the house and said hey 
we need you on the production lines 
making war machineries 
so be it 
you know we had the 
out there helping out the the g i's fine 
team effort wasn't it 
but then 
after g i's came home 
the little lady went back in to the house 
and business all these 
idle lines say hey 
we can do something here 
because in those days the little lady said well i will go out and get a little odd job uh we want a little 
thing 
mom would do 
pick up a little extra things here 
and so forth 
dad was a  
primary breadwinner 
but she'd go out and do some odd jobs just to compliment 
their needs for that budget 
they bought things on a cash basis as they needed it 
they did not 
go out and spend on credit 
and now i mean i'm jumping ahead of myself here but 
business said hey let's produce these lines 
little lady you want a refrigerator we can make it for you and we can make it cheap for you because we can mass produce it 
now it comes back to your statement 
what do they 
us we need 
well now well gee  you need a refrigerator you need frost free 
you need all these things 
and you know  
you go down the street and see how many garage sales you have 
and then you ask people 
why'd you buy them 
we thought we needed them 
see it 
again 
the business out foxed the consumer 
basically 
you need to do 
less consumption and buying material goods 
and sharing your time with one another trying to understand your neighbor  
and spending time giving quality time for understanding the intangibles 
of life 
tangibles depreciate 
and they will depreciate and will be nothing 
and your investments 
gone 
but you 
to you 
you had to work 
you had to 
you had to migrate 
they they started separating the family up 
by saying 
sir if you want a job we're expanding to los angeles we're  
so they split the family up 
okay fine 
and the family 
probably said okay we're we want you to get 
advancement we want 
your good will 
the problem is 
you ran up a culture differences 
culture differences over here and so forth 
and then we became a little more 
uh promiscuous 
and i said well gee you know 
mom dad and so forth they don't know what's going on out here on the west coast with us you know and so forth 
they think everything is going okay because we didn't have communication as  
and then all of a sudden you find out 
and usually mom found out she is something doesn't sound right through the airways or to the writing something's mysterious going on here 
and you find out they were  having difficulties 
well divorce became acceptable 
before it was a no  
now it's acceptable 
and then 
you had 
uh the celebrities becoming more notable   we don't we don't  we don't get married anymore no okay 
then we had the idea 
of doing away with  
gold metallic the metallic backing i think it was 
was the one that did that 
and said we will just uh 
print promissory notes 
and so  
now we keep  
we 
we buy ourselves out every dilemma in the  
saying well hey we will just pay you  
we pay you more country then fine 
but every time they 
print more 
it makes the money in your  investment  
but hey who cares huh that's what they 
kept promoting 
and then all of sudden about nineties they came around and said 
you know what 
our  our deficit is going the other  
we're 
we're going way out of whack on this thing 
that's because we've been spending more 
are doing the same thing 
they haven't  that mom and dad remember 
mom when out and got a little piece as the time as they needed things 
no i want the whole house completely furnished i want the cars 
we don't talk about buying 
nowadays we talk about leasing cars 
and pretty soon we're not gonna be buying houses we will be leasing houses from the finance companies 
we won't be owning the land the finance company own the 
you don't own it 
you're leasing it 
and that's our quality of  
and when we go to third world countries we say 
i don't know how they can stand living here 
and  
you know what 
they probably have better quality of understanding one another 
then we do 
because i feel like the more you get closer to one another the further you become apart 
you said were their governments  
government stays out of  
that's our problem 
government's 
into too many things 
they need to be 
out of your nose 
that's your personal business they need to be out of your business 
the personal thing is you need to have 
ethics 
in the business world 
in other words 
i used to work 
uh during  highschool days 
for a furniture company  back in those days it was nine days 
we'd sell it to people and the 
and i said well gee 
we just 
and we talked to the manager 
oh they they don't have the  they don't have the money that's financed the  
well why are we selling it to them then 
well we will get our money back and the bank bank get the money and we will get a  we will repossess it 
and we sold the same darn thing over three or four  
this poor sucker is out there get stuck with credit ratings 
the bank's making money 
we're making money 
they're losing 
now is that business ethics 
i ask you 
is it no 
is it proper business  ethics 
that's where we need to correct 
that's where you need to correct 
you can't just say 
hey we got a schnook out here we can screw him 
that's a 
problem 
and you're saying does it  does it does it take home does it take church 
it 
takes morals 
and that's why i was telling before we got away from morals in our society 
we could care less about you 
i always say a  a uh good successful salesman will be able to sell his own mother 
i mean sell his own mother 
on a  on the market 
you're not gonna make as much 
the people are gonna say gee i'm not going to them 
i'm 
place else 
again it gets back to weaknesses in our standards in society 
we we could care less about anybody else 
we don't 
hey if i have problems 
the government is gonna help me out 
that's a mindset that's been entrenched for forty some  
a mindset 
that if you talk to the older generations are dying off now 
that said we would never had in our lifetime 
it's a ruination of our 
country 
and if you are old enough to remember kruschev 
i believe krushchev is right we will bury you 
we will bury you internally in other words we will break you up you will separate internally you have dysfunctional people we are 
we're dysfunctional families 
if you ever work on pastoral care activity you will find out that people 
are so concerned about their families 
that they  
they fail 
they think because their family is broken up they've got 
single parents here they've got 
divorced here 
uh 
they don't know what's going on they're doing drugs 
well the 
problem is we never got involved 
as you said busy 
we make more time you know there's more time 
spent for soccer on sunday 
then going to church 
you talk about 
uh they said was it meet the press  as i think slogan is 
a 
without meet 
a sunday without meet the press 
you know day 
was it 
something like  sunday's not a sunday without meet the  
well hey 
that just tells you right there 
where our thoughts  
we're  
of ourselves 
i guarantee it as you get older 
you start thinking a little differently 
and i think as you talk you should be talking to some older people 
i'm saying people um in the in their eighties 
to find out how the progression of life is 
and how you think 
because when you go to estate sales 
all you're talking about this profit motive 
you're sitting on a lawns 
the quality of life 
is in the mind the person you're 
you you avoided all the time 
and that's what we're concerned with 
you need to interact more with people we need to interact more people 
every day of our life that's what we 
learn 
from 
we don't learn by giving 
things to people 
just like if you were um 
a parent giving a giving allowance you don't give them to 
your kids uh money to do chores and that you don't expect them to do 
but you give them something in addition 
to develop more responsibility 
but we don't talk about responsibility in our society today 
i 
i 
i dare you to say we're in a  
they say publicly 
this is 
our bill of responsibility 
do you know where there is 
do we talk about responsibilities now 
if you if 
if if you say buy 
buy from those 
unscrupulous business people and say 
ah gee these guys got it on credit 
yeah 
what happens to that person 
that files bankruptcy 
ah 
file bankruptcy it's okay 
i will do something else 
next time 
we start them over again 
they have never learned 
and reason why 
you're throwing out 
out too 
much in front of them without saying hey 
you gotta do this to prove this to me 
we we we 
lack  
one heck a lot of 
moral standards in this country we're losing it every day 
and until we start looking at ourselves in in the mirror at night and say 
i'm proud of myself i'm proud of what i did 
i may not have made a dollar  
but i understood somebody  
no 
oh  
i 
i don't think it's necessarily that i think it's comes back to the lack of self discipline 
no i 
you had women that working before 
you had 
women working before 
but self discipline is 
family 
it's part of it 
self discipline 
making things too easy for us oh we 
do without it 
you ever 
you ever try to work for something i mean you really struggle to to achieve something 
did it mean more to you than something that was given to you 
tell me 
but but was if that if that but if that p h d was given to you 
if they lowered the standards 
if they lowered the standards 
for you to get into 
graduate  
it wouldn't that be challenging for you hey great they lowered it for me 
my sister didn't have oh she had a rough time getting in but now i can get in anywhere i got a lower  
that 
doesn't that mean make 
so when you compare 
right 
they 
and that's it they hadn't had a challenge you need to have challenges put 
to you everyday 
everyday 
you have more meaningfulness in life 
so that when you 
put your head down at night you're saying oh i'm thankful for what i did 
gosh darn it i'm still coming to you 
i  more help tomorrow because 
without 
something 
there's gonna be a motivation factor 
someone's gotta give you a drill and to get up tomorrow morning and say hey i'm gonna do a better job today 
than i did yesterday 
but when we 
as a society 
say oh 
gee 
he's struggled yesterday well 
let's lower this thing bar let's 
lower the bar a little more 
let's lower 
you know 
gosh darn it 
hey 
scooney you didn't make that last shot last night 
hey 
hey time out 
let's give scooney two more minutes to make 
let's let him have another shoot 
he gets two more minutes to try to get it 
and we will just watch 
okay 
come on scooney 
he made it okay he made it in 
three minutes 
thirty seconds left he made it 
we win now 
does that make the game interesting to you 

if  if we really score sports 
i mean 
the game of sports not the  the administration of sports is just as unethical as the business world 
it is 
unethical 
and it's one of the biggest problems we have in our society 
because we've emphasized 
sports 
along with the theater 
as being 
oh the 
way to  
and that the poor 
the poorest benchmarks you could have 
in terms of financial 
appreciation 
sure you 
thing is you 
market demands the uh dollar that type of thing well yeah 
let them do it 
but the thing is 
it gets almost be 
like a lawsuit case 
we are 
crazy and insane people 
again gets back to 
ethics 
do you think 
do you think i'm worth 
thirty million  
let me ask you let 
let me ask you question 
why in the hell are you coming and asking for thirty million  
don't you think you're 
and yet 
we sit down and negotiate for it 
and then on top of it 
those people that participate in the 
um 
sponsors 
are 
just as bad 
well i think it was then 
a nice thing about we 
we had uh 
grandparents that were not necessarily they were out of state 
in some cases 
we didn't see them that much 
we made a part that 
uh we communicated with the grandparents regularly 
and when we did  it was a special  
emphasized the fact that  
you know kids wanna do certain things okay they saw their mother 
go out and maybe  some additional things to work for that 
uh the aspect 
we uh asked them if they wanted to go on um 
a project with the class so forth fine 
but you gotta participate in it too we we will match you with what you come up with 
we made them part of the  
we gave them responsibilities 
they grew up with the aspect 
they learned by being around 
some older people 
uh 
which uh i think was good 
because uh again i said you 
bring up you get wisdom from that as long as you're listening to them 
people 
i don't care what their age was they just blew them  
and so that plus you have they 
i think a understanding of um 
the schooling 
they came from 
um 
they went they went to private schools they went to private schools 
i certainly did not want them to go to public schools 
and even when going to ohio state 
um 
compared to miami university i saw a difference i see a differences in the standards of the of the students 
uh 
but 
i believe and i've seen it with my son going to ohio state that his 
morals 
that he's gained through his uh 
pre-college years 
are staying with him 
uh and i'm very grateful that there's uh spiritual guidance i keep telling these guys 
guys 
my daughter and son 
excuse me 
that um 
you know they'd come to me for 
answers 
now i think 
now i  that's something that's probably the other problem is sometimes maybe the  
the the  siblings  the children do not have a parent to go to 
but 
again let me   reiterate 
we don't have a smooth marriage 
they saw us have difficult times 
and they saw us 
saw us our spouses crying together 
forgiving one another 
arguing with another 
just as much as you can have a being human relationship they saw that 
they saw the love for one another 
they saw 
over night where i'd start take caring for my dad 
because my mother died instantly you know like short term an hour 
and now he has a stroke 
i didn't know whether 
i stay out of their  
and i had to learn all that 
i had 
of 
but then they saw my  
over some my role at  
so we swing them that's why i said a team 
we knew what we had do 
uh my son might come home i said well gee you know he he he might smart off my wife will say hey 
that's your dad give him respect 
oh 
okay 
okay it's part of growing up 
and i i've been there done that too but still 
you have to 
you have to um 
know there's respect out there to be warranted 
and you expect it 
and not just 
demand it 
you got to 
you have to work to show 
respect and then you should get respect for it 
but then 
they saw the interaction with the elderly people 
the school he went to 
a lot of public involvement public service required 
the teachers 
i often ask the teachers i've gone to sporting events 
and their teachers are there 
ticket  
uh monitoring the crowd wherever the kids 
i ask them i said do you guys ever go home 
said  
oh yeah i said 
but they're always there 
they're not there just teaching a class 
they're not there 
preparing the class 
they're there 
after the class they're there for the student 
and they make the student feel part of the family 
that is a continuation of my philosophy at home 
we interact 
the school 
is great 
you have people that are on the clock oh 
time to quit 
they're gone 
those people don't know meaning of life 
they will never know the meaning of life 
but if they stay around 
try to extend themselves little more with somebody that's having problems at work 
and are willing to work with that person 
i didn't say 
willing to work 
not knowing 
they're going to be compensated 
because they will be compensated 
not necessarily materialistically they will be  
more than they're expected they will be 
recompensated somewhere 
but the thing is to 
lend an open hand 
not knowing 
well gee what's for 
what's in it for me 
what's in it for you is uh intangible 
are you willing 
then 
then you have a choice there 
you would not necessarily 
uh have 
you should've had more self control 
and not had the child 
don't expect me to pay for your 
uh lack of uh will power 
that's 
that is 
a selfish attitude 
that's stealing 
as well 
uhhum 
uhhum 
i'm sure somewhere 
i'm sure somewhere along the line that they would work things out to try to help her over those 
bumps 
it wouldn't be long term 
and they would know that it would not be long term 
but that's the intangible i'm saying you have somebody there because 
she's giving up her time and not to make the high bucks 
but  what she's bringing about is developing a character in a person 
to bring about the spirituality in a person that's gonna carry them all through life 
she's  
tithing 
more than 
probably 
uh which uh i always uh kid with people i said the author 
said ten percent tithing 
knew inflation he knew great about 
economics ten percent is ten percent 
and then 
uh on top of that you know 
we talked about economics uh 
little further here 
uh the japanese so forth they save so much more and the  and germans so forth 
and uh 
boy you know 
taking that page out of the old bible aren't they 
we don't 
oh yeah 
yeah 
definitely so my daughter definitely it's cause she was working for campus crusade for christ 
and she came home one 
weekend from uh oxford and um 

gave me these leading questions and i said uh huh 
i know where you're coming from i been confronted with that 
when i was at ohio state and so forth 
and um 
so i just layed it on the line to her 
in my own 
civilian terms i said 
why would you wanna give up on the original 
you know why would you wanna give up on the original have a copy 
because all these others 
wannabes 
well in other words you follow christianity 
the catholic church is the first 
christian church 
and all the others 
are fragments 
they wannabe they still tie back to it but uh don't want  
it's like the commitment i was telling you 
well i'd like to but 
could you make a little extra 
give me two more minutes make that field goal 
oh yeah we will give you those but 
okay 
then we will start we will start only up here 
and we 
and we will organize all this stuff but then we're gonna give two extra minutes in our rules 
okay 
we gonna live this way and uh so forth 
so we we 
we develop things as they accommodate to our own selfish  
not to the 
sacrifice of what we should be doing 
and we're all mortal and we're all gonna be 
in that 
and we're i'm not saying no one makes those errors makes errors it's always there 
the problem is 
to 
try to stay focused 
on that 
not to jump ship 
you know they say in this country 
oh you don't like leave it 
why would you wanna leave you said you're a third world country 
why would you wanna be to table to i'd been 
i wouldn't 
this this country has a lot of problems 
it's just like 
my family has a lot of problems why would i   
leave the family why would i leave the country 
why not 
work with it and correct it cause when i run away from it 
you know what i'm doing 
i'm running into another chaos 
at the other end 
someone else coming the other direction 
and they haven't resolved things 
and that's been happening our society 
we haven't 
sit down 
to learn 
and understand one another 
uhhum 
well 
as i told my 
daughter when she came i said you know 
religion is is 
is a business she says oh no dad it's not religion 
i said it sure is a business 
i said 
it's just 
the superficial things 
the packages 
are attractive to you 
and notice how they keep changing packages of your favorite 
article 
every now and then 
uhhum 
i said but when you get down to the meat 
of it 
it's the same thing 
and i said 
and that's where it comes down to 
the catholic church for example 
they can put all you can have folk masses you can do all this superficial stuff on the thing to make it more attractive 
and they do every 
every religion 
makes it more attractive for her 
oh as used to 
come from oh yeah 
but the bottom line is 
you're trying to still 
if you're a christian 
focus back to the bible 
okay 
how do you do how do you get back to the original without 
being part of the original 
well my question is 
who's more important in our basketball team 
the five starters or the sixth man coming off the bench 
i ask you now who 
ask george reese is he more 
is he less important this year than he was last year 
well that i'm making an analogy with you women 
who's more important 
who saying 
that not 
being 
not being a priest 
is not important 
being your individual 
we're 
all called to 
be 
important 
a priest is just as 
a occupation 
a part of that society out there 
he do 
president of the united states isn't any better off than you are 
he shouldn't be 
what 
we're animals 
we're animals 
everyone's looking for leaders 
it's the rules of church simplest rule 
so if you want get to me two more minutes a play 
okay now you got another leg 
but the thing is 
let me ask you question 
how does that impact you if you can't be a priest 
aren't there 
other 
important 
quote unquote 
roles for women 
in the church 
aren't there other important roles 
aren't there other important roles 
what would those nuns be 
where would your mother 
possibly been if she went to catholic school 
i take it 
where would she have been 
if it weren't for the nuns 
why we put nuns down 
hey 
they worked 
lot less than your mother 
is even getting compensated for 
and they had a very important role 
for 
your 
development 
even though you're generation is removed 
well that gets back to what you're saying almost th the family life 
hey what's ahead 
what you don't need a 
husband all you need is a sperm bank 
that's what you're saying aren't you 
aren't you 
yes you are you're saying you don't need to have a leader 
in the family 
you 
and if i'm gonna be a leader i'm gonna be the one 
i'm gonna be the one not the sperm bank oh you came from this little tube here oh okay that's the principle family no i hafta be because 
there's no father here 
well 
again they set different roles 
the 
they set different roles up fine 
give me two more minutes to play 
the problem is 
lack of commitment 
the lack of commitment 
and not saying hey 
there's a niche for you 
you can't be a male 
oh yeah you wanna do the operation i can't be feeling yeah you wanna do 
well 
why not be happy what you are god made you what you are 
why not make 
you the complete person you are 
and not strive for something you can't 
be 
that's the thing 
but the thing is some people 
some people say 
some people say 
well watch this the thing is 
why don't you talk to those people and say hey 
why not 
do what i'm doing best 
in other words compliment the team 
yes 
uhhum 
right 
so we lower the standards to meet that 
product certain things 
but they 
they want everything to be the same they can't be 
they can't be the same it's just a natural thing 
but the thing is 
let them 
do what they can 
that's a god given talent what you have there 
okay nurse 
and how many refuse the nurse voluntarily 
when they have children 
why 
talking among you women folk 
why 
do you have well i don't want to 
you have the natural ability 
to give all the 
all the natural protein the immunization things all that maternal 
milk why can't you instead of getting off the shelf 
it's just a rule 
it's a rule coming down hand down 
tradition 
there's a tradition 
you see now you're looking you're looking for reasons 
that's 
looking for science 
and 
go back and ask them 
as as as i would ask uh uh my uh 
english teacher in school uh 
anybody that said well what this poet 
uh what was his 
now he wrote this  
um  i gave my interpretation no no now they say 
no no that wasn't it 
they share their thought 
how do you know that was it 
he's been 
dead 
so how do you know 
how do you know 
as a teacher how would you 
how could you cut down a student and say no that's not the way it was 
and it's nothing 
you're learning from a teacher's guide 
no but how do you know if i ask in the first 
but it's a matter of tradition of handing it down to the tradition 
itself 
it's a matter of having in your family 
what did your parents think of this way and that way 
and it's 
it's not 
necessarily 
written down but it's passed on those days probably written down or not written down but 
verbal 
and extended 
and so it's that 
hand down from generation 
those were the good old days 
that's a good old day that's when you used to own them too 
you could trade them 
that 
that's when we lost our rights 
there are some things that are traditional that are 
capital t and some are little t 
little case t 
and you're talking about little t case t 
i'm talking about 
capital t 
oh yeah 
i think everybody 
should if nothing else you missed your boat 
by that time 
yeah 
yeah 
he has ah he hasn't questioned me like that but i see a lot of things coming out he's doing 
more 
in why he's been doing things about more differently than my daughter cause my daughter 
was away at school and he's with us 
everyday so he's home every doesn't wanna stay on campus 
uh and uh 
it's 
he does things voluntarily we don't have to 
coach him he's working with a lot of other people i mean the 
what he's been reared with coached with and so forth 
it's 
somewhat imbedded 
he sees that and matter of fact some of the girls he's 
dating uh 
they see that in him and i think that's a quality they 
they say gee and 
and 
i  i i  i give them thanks because uh say hey you know it's it's rough out there because uh 
and and the guys he runs around with 
good quality guys i thought wow you know 
they're ornery sure 
but 
uh 
i i wouldn't 
i wouldn't trade his friends for anything gosh uh 
i don't know how i came up with him i myself but 
which kids 
oh 
they've been just troubled kids in the past they have 
yeah they were they were troubled kids in the past they came from troubled backgrounds they did 
well i'm saying but the 
oh i think uh 
i don't know there that much detail but most time it comes down to a lack of uh 
knowing 
your your children how they're gonna react to certain things 
oh what it is uh 
i don't know details with thing other than the fact that they're 
seem like there's lot emptiness going on 
uh with them 
and uh 
and i think that's part of problem we have in our uh in our life i've 
uh 
i 
it'd be very difficult um 
i think uh 
in our in traveling if you say okay i'm gonna give up this life here and go to the 
third world and live 
or else do less 
less reverse bussing 
hey okay upper arlington 
you live northwest side why you down and live on the east side 
why don't you live for a year 
no not do it for a year 
just go down for the day and then come back to upper arlington night and 
live 
how'd you like do that 
hm 
no no 
but that 
but that's what i'm saying 
but but that's that's what i'm saying and the same things happening when we had a bussing 
we took kids out of the poor environment 
and put them in 
nice environment 
oh they 
they've got the taste of it then went back home 
oh 
and we did and 
very unjustice thing to those kids 
and to the families 
and then when we broke them up 
we did something else you know take them out 
then we lost that community involvement so now the parents can't follow their kids to their activities 
get them splitting it up hey 
we don't want them we don't want a families 
that's a 
misnomer they said 
the fam 
the community 
raises the family 
the kids 
yeah that's how they want you to think 
but the family the community will not re-replace the family 
oh yeah 
yeah 
uhhum 
grand cayman 
just my wife and i this time 
i   
traveling has been 
even for the transportation department i travel across the state 
and country 
and before that i was always traveling we took 
two weeks off when we go back  
to fall semester 
that time it was semesters not quarters 
and uh 
uh get on the greyhound bus fifty dollar pass was buddy and i we'd just travel 
all over the country and sleep on the bus at night 
i enjoy traveling i enjoy meeting people when i go on these 
these travel things i have to for business i meet 
with the uh 
the the ships and so forth go back behind but then 
when i go to the ports 
uh 
the companies pretty much know what they 
contract with us 
i like to meet with the people there 
the gestapo and so forth i will talk with them and 
and uh 
learn more about 
their little 
uh things just like 
down in saint croix last year uh 
spent two hours talking to the security there and he said 
boy there's something wrong you guys from the continentals 
i said continental 
that's what we call you guys from the states 
oh boy 
i said 
and 
this 
and here 
i here 
i come from this is a gentlemen that's uh 
dark skin 
i don't know if he's black or colored 
i'm still confused as to what difference in black and colored is 
but 
uh 
he says 
you know my brothers probably came 
to these islands to the to the continental 
they come down here 
and they're getting all 
they're swaying themselves they're 
acting cocky to me and so forth 
and i say 
we don't do that here 
and i said well i know this you know 
uh 
there's a lot of black population here 
creole mix and that type of thing 
which i would consider colored not black 
uh to me black is black 
if you have anything mixed in you it's colored 
uh 
but 
he said uh 
we don't 
do that 
uh 
he said 
problem in the states gosh you guys  
daddy wants 
kid wants a car get him a car 
down here 
child only comes from the school 
i uh i gave him a dinner 
but i ask him to sweep off the front porch 
now i will still give him his dinner but i ask him please did you do your 
sweep the front porch 
may not sound much but at least i'm trying to teach him something 
and you 
you saw all that down there 
in the people where we were down 
fredericksburg 
but uh 
it it's it's just those things you you learn and and there's other times i was down in jamaica and you went back into the back country and you saw 
very impoverished uh area so i
almost made a mission film where the families living with the animals in the same house 
and 
you try to understand and 
and you you will never 
they will never get away from poverty and the classes in our society that's just 
life there's always gonna be that but the thing is 
try to have understanding compassion for them and try to reach out and 
sometimes the people don't 
want it 
either 
and 
sometimes you can see well now i know why they don't want it because they don't know they don't know how to handle it 
they appreciate the thought 
that goes a lot longer than just giving them that 
because if they get it they don't know what do with it 
so 
i i really 
i really think uh 
um 
as i was saying traveling 
uh people are all the same worldwide 
they just give them different colors different facial 
different accents 
so god can give them 
unique characteristics so he can call them his own 
and he knows each every one of us 
but uh 
we're all the same it's down to talking about the emotions and 
the drive 
and i keep asking her keep a 
one thing to ask yourself 
and ask the business person 
what would you be doing 
today if you were born in a third world country 
how thankful are you that you're here 
and how do you show that thankfulness 
you're you're here for a reason 
and you're here in the united states for a reason 
of all the beatitudes you have here 
don't you think it's time to share some of those things the talent 
and to 
not necessarily be recognized for those things but you know some 
some personalities require personalities that's the way it is but 
uh 
to do things without expecting something in return 
that would be so nice to see that written on magazine fronts oh yeah yeah 
we're not 
wow what's getting into these people they're not thinking 
you know if we can teach people to think 
the way you're trying to tell me well 
businesses tell us we should do this 
then why doesn't business 
take a more 
social correctiveness 
not political correctness 
no 
yeah the they will not increase until the tax law revises itself again to up 
the 
deduction allowances 
because even when we reduce deductions it went down to 
yeah 

no 
yeah  they will not increase until the tax law revises itself again to up the 
deduction allowances 
because even when we reduced deductions it went down too 
yeah 
yeah 
and then again 
uh you say well 
you know like well maybe some affluent uh person would donate and it's publicized 
donate so much don't know 
okay well that you remember 
back sometime in may were ninety percent tax brackets and so forth 
so that means ninety cents on that dollar he gave 
they didn't  they didn't bring that up 
he only gave ten cents 
again it gets back to the ten percent tithing 
and um 
i think there's something else in the bible where you know she 
the 
lady gives 
gives 
only a small portion compared to a larger portion but 
in relation to what her income was 
that meant a lot more 
and that we need to get more involved in that 
we need promote more of that 
if we're going package things materialize we need to think more of that 
but i think really take hold of the night 
what would you be doing if you're a third world country didn't have choice 
you 
why you be doing eight children 
and 
trying to feed eight children 
and it 
if you're here in a  this country 
any eight children 
why you have eight children to start with 
shouldn't you have little more knowledge little more 
support around you 
educating 
knowing 
self discipline 
and 
on what's on really on top what's really in crazy is when you have 
multiple fathers 
and the children don't know the dads 
that comes back to the lack of our morals and the lack of  
and our society promotes it 
they're doing a 
to tax laws in our uh all the government 
you see government do this government's doing it to themselves 
well i 
again gets back to being in the home 
did your mother give you everything you wanted 
then she failed you didn't she 
not really 
well according to the government she would have 
and you don't the problem is as a youngsters you grow up 
you don't realize how much your parents did for you until you're 
probably until you're about thirty  forty you don't realize my goodness mom and dad you made a sacrifice 
because now i'm learning a little more what you did 
and then by the time you're 
uh maybe 
sixty 
fifty sixty now you got  
take care of your parents 
if you have the morals to do it otherwise just ship them off to the farm 
and there's people like that today still 
you go 
but i think people should go to 
um 
retirement centers 
uh huh 
uh and uh sit down make a visit to them 
every 
week 
make it part of life 
and develop a friendship 
you'd learn a heck a lot from that uh 
aging person 
a heck a lot more than you would 
through interviewing me 
really 
no 
no 
i'm living 
yeah that's my  my um role call 
yeah 
yeah 
and uh 
that's the generation i'm talking about those are generation  they they went through the depression and so forth they 
they were the 
i 
i i pity i feel sorry for your generation 
which is my daughter's generation and uh 
part of my son's 
i because um 
i 
i 
i don't see how in the heck the wages aren't going up that much 
prices are up consumerism's going up 
somewhere along the  
uh the consumer is going to have to start getting a little wiser 
and say well 
what do i want out of life 
the trouble is 
if he does get wiser too much he's usually about forty years of age and he says gosh darn it i wish i listened 
it 
it would be interesting 
to see 
how much of your generation 
is saving 
first of all how much they earning 
how much they expect to pay for a house 
and all these other things 
know they they say to you why well i will save ten percent church 
then you got 
oh gee five dollars here  or 
twenty cents a 
twenty cents an hour  you this 
you figure all those up 
all these campaigns you hear during course a year 
i often thought it would be great for marketing 
take all those figures 
and add up and see if it adds up to a hundred percent 
and if it does 
then where are your goals 
see when i bought a house 
the financier 
came in i went to his office and he said 
oh mister  no problem no problem 
you can get that house 
i said 
i can 
yeah 
you're professional and you're wife's professional 
i said that's how you're evaluating it 
on both of us yes 
i said then i don't want to do business with you 
why i'm going give you a loan i said 
i don't want do business with you 
because you didn't ask me about my goals 
my goals was not to have my wife 
work 
because nowadays 
takes two of them to work 
i'm  wondering when they're going to child labor law 
uh revoke that 
because 
with two of them working 
i'm wondering how many more hours a day 
you can squeeze out of a couple's personal life 
so they will have sanity 
at some time in their life to enjoy life 
when these people start realizing 
hey  
it's  
we're chasing our tails 
then those two  that that couple 
got wise and said hey 
we're going to do with less 
and we're going go for quality 
when that 
when that couple reaches that mentality 
mister loan officer 
you're gonna have a greater society to work with 
and you won't have as many repossessions 
i'm sorry it goes against your goal 
but goes against 
it 
it's more positive for our society 
and that's been it 
my wife's been working part time 
all her 
tenure that's fine keep her license up 
she's a nurse 
the thing is 
i don't 
want i didn't want her i wanted her to be home with the kids i didn't want somebody else to rear our kids 
and i don't know 
if our kids realize this or not 
but i do know my 
my 
my brother in law 
mentioned to his uh parents he said 
gosh what a sacrifice you guys did for us 
and he just turned fifty 
and they don't have any kids 
and he says 
wow i don't know how you did it 
well for one thing they probably did 
a lot of sacrificing 
and when you sacrifice 
it becomes 
makes you more humble 
and it makes you a 
a better person 
because 
you got the spirituality inside you driving you 
and that's what's gonna take you home 
i often ask of people 
uh 
you ask me about marketing 
uh do you think there's a heaven 
and how do you picture it 
yeah 
okay 
see 
the way i look at heaven 
myself is that 
i have a chance to meet all my acquaintances i had over the past 
my family 
and i will see them face to face 
and i will recognize them 
and they will recognize me 
but 
something transcends them 
because as i look to them 
unlike when they're on earth 
my goodness we're taught to learn 
the most negative thing about person 
psychology says if you see a blank sheet of paper you see the dot on the thing 
you don't see the other ninety nine percent of the paper you see that dot 
it's gonna be just the opposite in heaven 
i can't think of a negative thing about you 
and the reason why you can't think of a negative thing about them 
because 
you see christ's 
appearance coming through them 
and they see the same thing it's mirrored back to them 
because we're made in christ's images 
and we can't say no to him 
that's what heaven's like that's what we should go to bed at night thinking 
what did we do positive today 
and build on the positive it may be the smallest part of that sheet of paper 
i made a difference 
i helped someone 

i listened to someone 
i just touched someone 
who will be successful 
you will be successful 
individual 
and that's what's most critical 
you yourself has 
to do it 
not the business 
because from you 
businesses observe 
oh yeah 
there's gonna be 
unconditional love out there 
um hum 
um hum 
my my thing is is you still you 
you try do your best on earth through the attributes you have 
whether it's supposed to be a missionary fine 
if 
you see a missionary working in the office 
there's needs for missionary work in the offices around this 
on a campus 
everyday 
they're talking about diversity here 
all ya do is just sit down 
you know what it's numbers game 
it's not a numbers game at all 
just learn about 
one another and your gonna find out you know what 
i think they said the  the color blind society 
uhhum that's all we gotta do 
when you're in a coma 
or when you're 
let's say you're out 
you can't see anything 
you didn't do the surgery on you 
are you gonna be  
you gonna qualify well i want this surgeon to be this and that and that then that 
do you want this donor to be this this and that  
some people will  some people some people say that 
i feel sorry for those people 
i pray for those people 
because prayers the most powerful thing you can have 
it's gonna get you through 
nothing else 
i don't care what  challenge you have in front of you 
you put in his hands 
and you have enough faith to practice it 
he will come through 
it may not come through the way you think it's 
you want it to 
but somewhere along the line 
you're gonna say 
uh 
for some reason i wasn't  i'm supposed to do this 
i can't explain it 
but you're always looking for reasons you're asking me 
i'm looking for reasons  
but a lot of times you can't give a reason 
it just happens 
why did you marry your husband why did you how did you meet your husband how did you come about how  passing on to 
explain that to your offspring someday 
well  
of 
the thing is 
there's things you can't explain 
can't you can't explain that 
and those have been questions that i've been asked by my 
our children 
how'd you mom and dad 
oh gee i 
how do you  
well hey that's a   that's one of the risks in life 
marriage 
but the thing is 
do you wanna make it work 
and you said don't we divorce more acceptable 
divorce should never be acceptable 
i disagree with society there 
it should be something to work with 
it's just like 
hey 
well what  of  you gonna have this year 
o'brien oh we're gonna have a losing season uh i don't care 
now that that go over well here wouldn't it 
it'd go over well 
oh we don't care how we're gonna do 
we'd we just want five guys out there on the court and so forth but we don't nah we're not gonna 
nah 
you gonna oh we lost were we lost one two academics this year 
i don't know why but we got four guys and that's okay 
that's divorce 
that's her attitude 
no commitment 
do these guys have commitment 
and you see the guys out there 
they wanna may go further possibly in their careers and professionals 
others 
want to 
maybe  something whatever it is you ask each  individual what is it drives you 
and that's the thing 
you 
i get so perturbed in interviewers 
they ask somebody and 
and somebody comes back and say you know what i mean yeah 
what did he 
no i don't 
get inside the guys mind and i don't 
what did he mean 
you know what i mean yeah 
no i don't know what you mean 
ya know play dumb 
it 
pull it out of them 
what do you mean 
uh 
michael red what do you plan on doing after school 
when i was growing up they used to give the grade point average in the major of this 
of the 
of the student 
of the 
student  
they don't do it today unless the person's a scholar 
i mean a 
you have  point eight 
rhodes scholar 
hey 
okay 
five starters 
what you major 
uhhuh 
needle pointing 
finger paints 
journalism 
and um medicine okay 
crosswords okay 
gives our uh 
younger people some mentors look after doesn't it 
and where're your scores and those 
oh i'm 
oh gee i'm just barely getting by passwords 
you know 
but that's the problem we've lack of standards no that's their right keep it private 
but no 
i wish those guys would just 
stop hey 
i'm 
i'm majoring in 
accounting i'm majoring in finance i'm majoring in business 
and 
i got three point five i got 
two point six 
oh and whatever the criteria is to play on the the team 
why aren't you playing this week 
well i'm  
i'm still required to practice even though i can't play this week 
why can't you play 
it's the it's the rule 
what rule 
well if i don't make 
certain things during the week 
which is academic 
i still hafta perform 
uh sports wise 
make that commitment 
but if i don't 
fall if i fall through on that then i'm off the team period 
but those are things that be brought up publicized more instead of saying 
well hey we brought this much ticket gate this month and 
he got this scores and this percentages and that 
we need to expand more on that so that the younger people 
have some better role model 
to look at 
and not just playing round ball or the the spiral 
we need to get them out there and say 
how you gonna perform in school 
ya know 
i'm sure michael red's got some mentors out there they see guys wearing number five and whatever the number is and 
eight 
whatever it was 
okay they got there's a reason for it 
but 
what 
what's 
what's the other part of it 
we don't do that because why 
we don't wanna bring it up and we don't wanna bring 
some embarrassment possibly or 
but that's 
part of life 
when they get 
out in the real world i'm talking about 
these guys 
some would be successful in terms of 
whomever 
and 
some will be successful 
in 
other people eyes 
but the thing is 
show the kids that are watching them  
there is more 
than  sports 
sports 
is a by product here go to ohio state 
it is 
it is unifying 
and i just wish 
they 
but i guess there's a rule out there i've asked uh a b c news why they can't 
promote the uh 
these uh 
you know they they show the roster here here's their grade point average engineering major fine 
tell them what the majors are tell what these kids are what they plan on doing 
they're not all gonna make it to the  
professionals 
then what to do do they afterwards 
they get token jobs because their connections 
and then how satisfying is that to them 
when you have a chance to talk to them 
that's where we need to learn more from interview 
have more meaningful interviews with these people so that 
we can learn from them 
they put me on spotlight but we 
somehow 
we just don't wanna 
uh i guess flood them with the 
we don't wanna get the 
negative answer because of all might hurt the image of the university 
oh gee ya know 
when we who was it katsenmoyer 
well hey 
we realize that 
the university only wants players who will draw gate money 
that's all they wanna do 
they're not here for academics 
they don't talk about academics when they're coming to ohio state 
i wish they would 
these guys going to military school and so forth you know they've had problems before somewhere aline 
whether it's academics or social 
are you ready take on this additional responsibility 
no 
but we don't 
promote it 
again 
you bet we get  
every rule we have academics for the university 
oh you gonna be a sport athlete oh then you 
we got different standard here 
i'm sure they do 
they have different standards for 
as student athlete 
as opposed 
to what your standards were 
coming into college 
i'm presuming you were not an athlete 

okay 
okay good 
ah 
uhhum 
although janet you just said yesterday that 
people are so overweight in columbus because there's not very much to do that 
actually 
they uh what they 
do is they eat 
out all the time we 
it's the restaurants i know it they're incredible 
uhhum 
uhhum 
wonderful restaurants 
uh they seem to 
we like to  i do i like to cook i enjoy cooking 
uh just really 
not 
extraordinarily different food necessarily but just 
just really 
oh i know 
i like to try new recipes i do like to do that 
but i don't think that i do a lot of real 
european cuisine necessarily 
but i i do look at recipes and 
enjoy eating the food too 
make a lot of salads 
i think our 
i don't know i think it's the combination plus i think the um 
i think the dressing is my sister's recipe for dressing 
and it's a balsamic vinegar dressing with olive oil and garlic it's just a real good dressing i tend to use that 
most times 
and everything being chilled just nicely chilled and 
all that sort of 
things 
you 
do it and i do tomatoes anyhow i will pay the extra  
higher price for the better ones but 
uhhum 
uhhum 
but most most of the vegetables are available 
truly the zucchini the 
um 
you will find your your green peppers smaller your uh i got a um 
cucumber the other day and usually they're so big and i tell you i 
think it was that long 
do you 
oh 
yeah those are nice 
yeah 
they're like  three times more price wise but 
they are good 
uhhum 
we had 
um 
my husband and i had just some 
herbs 
you know parsley and chives and some basil 
rosemary that type of thing 
uh and you know i don't think i have no 
small patio so 
do you you do that do you 
oh 
oh i know it 
i know it that 
that's really what's hard 
and now they have the little tiny grape tomatoes that are so cute 
haven't you seen they're  
they're 
the size of grapes 
yeah they're darling 
uh huh 
yeah 
uh huh 
i'm retired 
i worked for a company called highlights for children 
yeah 
yeah 
i was in the sales department 
through telephone marketing it was actual 
sales 
that i was doing 
i was there for fifteen years 
you do too 
i don't remember exactly probably so 
uhhuh 
but you're working now janet 
since march too 
yeah 
just since march 
hum 
she does a really wonderful job because she 
has a flair 
for interior design and so that 
you know presents itself in her the way she sets everything up in the stores it's very attractive 
uhhum 
no 
right 
the mustiness the old 
yeah 
west broad street 

uhhum 
well the furniture the dining room sets the 
the uh chairs the couches 
because they're they have enough money to 
buy new things and they don't want to necessarily send it down i don't think to the salvation army or the 
i i don't know but i 
think that they think that there's a better way of giving 
away 
and like good will they resell and salvation army they resell well we 
we 
we just started reselling 
yeah 
uhhum 
no 
no 
doesn't happen overnight 
child care 
i know it 
i know it 
and theresa the founder also realizes that if you can break that cycle 
through the children so the focus and the emphasis was really on the children 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
really 
ah 
yeah 
uhhum 
uhhum 
yes 
yes 
no kidding 
yeah where they need it 
right 
yeah 
right 
uhhum 
hum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
oh yeah 
yeah 
oh sure 
yes 
franklin park south is wonderful too or franklin park out east is beautiful too off of east broad street 
now that's 
volunteer also their guards are volunteer and they're on a grand scale 
that's where the uh conservatory is uh right 
uhhum 
hum 
just getting over there 
it's pretty far 
i help janet somewhat but not a whole lot i i have a project i work on not as much as i probably should but 
it's the swan cleaners project and what we do we have little 
houses donation boxes in all the swan cleaners 
and there's probably about 
hum probably a good forty forty five of those throughout the city so 
i'm in charge of that 
and i do some volunteer there 
that's for the benefit of the homeless families foundation 
and um 
other than that i just do housewifey things and you know after being it's the first i've been retired since last march 
so i'm adjusting to being home and 
not being so 
yeah 
really and and i mean i have to 
work at because i've been so busy for the last 
twenty five years 
yes makes it hard 
makes it difficult 
it's an adjustment 
i did have a  
a part time job 
i loved it it was just four hours a day but they wanted me to go full time and i just didn't feel like i wanted to go full time so 
i was working as a receptionist 
and uh answering the phone doing some light filing just a variety of tasks office type tasks and i really liked it 
i liked the hours but i didn't want to go eight hours compared to four 
so 
i left 

no but i've i have two daughters 
and two sons m  and i heard my daughters talking about they want to do something special 
for my 
sixty fifth birthday so 
they'd given me a party on my sixtieth so 
i don't know what it's going to be but i think they will do they 
they talked about something in the way of a trip 
so maybe something the three of us can do together 
so i'm just 
sitting back waiting 
it was a nice birthday party 
yeah i don't do a whole lot of it but i like to travel 
she  there's are wanderlust right there she travels all the time 
all by herself 
really 
uhhum 
particularly huh 
how many times you've been in ireland 
uhhum 
you were 
you had to go home because 
mother was ill 
year later uhhuh 
hum 
uhhum 
raised eleven 
hum 
hum 
uhhum 
those are unsettling times though 
you know 
yeah 
did he really 
janet we just had a man who took time to  
walk us all the way through the hospital 
he sure was 
oh yeah 
uhhum 

beer bottles sure do 
uhhum 
they're all 
um 
in business 
uh they work 
uh they're 
scattered 
i have a son in sacramento and a son uh in 
atlanta georgia 
and then i have a daughter in tulsa oklahoma and i have a daughter in ruston virginia 
so they did they're all  well 
three are married yeah 
they're 
they have a  
very nice standard of living all of them do 
i have six 
uhhum 
uhhum 
i know 
i know it i know it but you know there 
there's um three three of the family three of the children 
have 
children 
and they each have two 
there's a  
a  in each one the girl is the uh  uh oldest and then the boy 
second  
and uh 
that's good though and i hope and i know my son who isn't married right now 
he's um 
thirty one i know that he wants children very badly so 
so i should have probably end up with about eight or ten 
i would  
i would imagine so 
grandchildren 
uhhum 
yeah 
i thought was 
forty three 
oh 
but 
they were 
they were all around the same age you know and 
going to college 
my daughter julie does uh is very active though 
in um 
not necessarily that she 
has adopted two her two children 
so she's become very active in the 
adoption procedure in tulsa 
and uh 
oh okay okay 
uh yeah as far as the siblings go bernie is uh 
does charitable work 
dorothy 
uh 
has a lot of 
grandchildren and a lot of children she has six children so 
i think her family is her 
within her 
her life they she she does more with the children 
because most of them live here 
you know  our children are all away so 
we have the time 
oh i would be surprised 
interactive they are 
i think my daughter jennifer is very active uh 
um 
not so much 
um the 
the type of work that i do but i think she's very charitable 
very giving very um 
uhhum 
hum um 
hum um 
and her family 
hum um 
uhhum 
i think i would say the same thing 
because uh um 
course 
we had the benefit of having a mother 
who was very giving i mean  i think i learned a lot from 
her selflessness 
and um 

not only 
toward with us the children but 
just to 
other also 
you know how mother used to feed the bums that would 
up to front door and she'd fix them food and so she she was a very 
hum 
i i know i wasn't 
uhhum 
uhhum 
i think example is probably the best 
um 
they see that 
you care and 
they 
learn to care 
i think my son john he's the youngest i think he's a very compassionate soul 
uh very spiritual young man 
um more so than his brother is 
and  i always have  ah have to weigh that 
you know they say that 
sometimes 
you give because it 
makes you  you feel better to give 
and i sometimes try to weigh that if 
that's 
part of why 
i 
i 
i 
i can't believe it it's 
an attention getter because 
there's nothing to be gained by 
getting attention for the works you do 
but 
um 
but maybe just within maybe one feels 
um 
and i think  i think 
it 
it's a matter of being conscientious too 
you know conscientious that there are 
less fortunate out there and that 
there's little things we can do 
i think that's kind of where i'm coming from janet i know you 
i janet  
i mean what 
my sister does  i just say to her i just really admire it 
i can't give as much as she gives i can't just don't have that same spirit she has but uh 
great to see 
i mean she's real 
she really 
when she's with 
the people 
i don't know i have this 
thing probably about me that you know you can stand on your own two feet and you can 
lead a better life but janet just 
envelops them with her kindness and um 
probably has less expectations from 
the people she works with 
hum 
oh 
help them 
yeah 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
very much so uhhum 
i do 
uhhuh 
yeah 
no i don't go to mass everyday but i go on sunday 
three three out of my four children 
do 
belong to the catholic church 
and then my one daughter chose in living in oklahoma 
she is 
in 
a baptist church 
but she's very active within the church very active through the sunday school and 

through the woman's group and 
not really but i think living in the bible belt as she did she was 
living there ten years before she married 
and uh got involved in a youth group 
and i think that that was very influential on her decision and 
so she was married in the church all my other children were 
but you know 
she's 
she is 
going her own path and that's fine with me she's very good girl and she's very 
conscientious and 
no not really i mean i would have preferred it of course 
and i would prefer that she carried on the faith the same as 
the rest of the children did 
but no 
i'm 
i'm very happy and content with  
her decision 
yeah 
very much so 
in  as a matter of fact ironically julie the tulsan 
she and her husband both baptists 
they have both their children in a catholic prep school and yeah kindergarten and preschool and it's a 
yes it's it's a catholic school environment so it will be interesting to see what evolves 
from 
the children's 
uh 
attention to 
the 
the roman catholic side of religion as compared to the baptist so 
oh i take the little ladies i take to church 
they're two elderly women that at the church  it this has been about of seven or eight years ago 
father just mentioned that they had 
a need 
uh they had had a church bus and it had broken down so 
they had a need for 
to get 
people to church and i met these two elderly women 
now 
the one now is ninety she turned ninety last october and the other one is about  
eight 
now 
and they live together and uh 
i take them to church on sunday 
grocery store afterwards usually so it does take up a big part of sunday but 
and i don't do it as regularly now because 
of the advance in age you know 
and that they're at the nazareth 
nazareth towers which is good because they they're 
they get better care there 
yeah 
they're dear 
well it's not every sunday anymore uh but it was for a long time it was for a long time 
very slow very methodical we take them to  my husbands taken them many times for 
when they had to have cataract operations you know so 
he's involved with the girls too 
oh yeah that was a that was a job helping them to move 
janet lou helped 
she helped a lot 
uhhum 
doesn't bother me at all 
i see no 
i mean it it 
oh well 
i don't believe that 
absolutely 
absolutely 
that was a lot of old thinking 
there is very definitely 
i think they've tried to 
to uh bring the laymen in 
to 
more of the priest 
the duties of the priest 
but there's like the consecration uh of the bread and wine that 
that none of that has been sanctioned 
they don't perform they don't 
uh 
uh  
um they're not able to give the sacramental graces for baptism confirmation 
holy  uh well they do holy communion 
but uh extreme unction matrimony none of those 
uh have been delegated outside of the duties of the priest 
but 
um 
i still think that it's a good uh 
i do think the involvement of the laymen is very important 
but i don't have any  
i i mean that doesn't bother me a bit about women 
huh 
uh 
well 
and i don't agree with that either 
uhhum 
bar mitzvah 
i've never heard it said before like you said that that the reason women aren't priests is because they  don't 
show any kind of uh spiritual leadership 
i 
i've never heard that said 
and  there must be people who 
think that 
well when they had to cover their  i know all of that but i don't think that's really been 
uhhum um 
i don't 
think so 
well that's true 
that's right 
and they say not as many european men attend mass but in in 
at church yesterday i 
thought about that and noticed how many men 
there are who do go to church in the united states 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
i've always thought that it it ends up being  
a personal decision 

you know i i said to myself because i had post partem depression with my third and fourth child 
and i thought it 
what good am my going to be to these children if i'm not able to take care of them 
so 
decision was said 
after the fourth child we would practice birth control 
so i and i felt comfortable that 
no because i think there's the ideal 
in 
everything 
and 
if you can't live up to that ideal standard but you do the best you can do 
and uh i think that's where i was coming from 
i mean 
even now 
um 
i mean i i could never 
agree with abortion lets say 
i i would stand by the church and and most 
most of the church laws i do stand by 
but i guess the birth control issue became so personal 
and um 
it was just a decision that had to be made and i had to make it with a 
what i felt was a clear conscience and what i did 
i don't have any regrets for it 
what about you 
i think it has a lot to do with the fact that the 
that they 
the church 
yeah     procreation part of 
what marriage is all about but i see marriage as 
more than just propagating 
so that's 
you know 
a lot of my decisions were based upon that 
they haven't 
hum um 
right 
right 
well and don't you think too the  that 
the more they have found out psychologically speaking about 
children and the placement of children in the family and the 
um 
throes of not having enough or 
or being 
sorely neglected because you were one of so many i mean janet and i both 
know the  
that experience from being 
one of eleven children raised so you know you didn't have the advantages that 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
right 
right 
and of course i think too as in america the um 
the  
farm families you know they wanted 
that was more laborers for the vineyards so to speak so i think that might have influenced a lot of that 
but over the years it it um 
it just made sense to me 
in fact it 
looks like in my family that they're  going 
the children are going to be mostly in twos 
you know not even going to three or four 
i mean  
not over yet but my girls are forty two and 
forty one 
soon to be forty one so um 
i think that their child bearing years are over 
uhhum 
uhhum 
oh 
i know 
oh my gosh 
yeah 
see there i think there has to be a quality to life too 
and 
hum 
it's very hard 
that was your youth 
and that's good i mean 
that's good to be there 

uhhum 
uhhum 
um 
originally north side 
right in there 
yeah 
my grandmother is from ireland 
my grandmother and grandfather are both from ireland 
uhhum 
or 
ohio yeah i think 
yeah 
i'm not really sure 
i know they're from ireland that's all i know 
yeah my grandfather's  
um dead and my grandma's still alive right now 
she loves my son 
yeah 
he's seven months 
he's seven months 
yep 
he's climbing on stuff and everything 
uhhum 
crazy 
not  not yet 
not 
i mean  he will pull himself up on tables and he will like turn around like hey 
check this out 
and then he will let go and fall on his butt 
it's kind of funny 
kind of he he's kind of 
you know stumble foot 
still 
you know 
one and then it 
you know 
i can't wait till mine's crawling and 
or walking and all that and i can take you to places and you don't have to carry him you can hold his hand 
it's great 
because he's heavy he's killing my back 
oh yeah that's what everyone said you think 
um i go to north land high school 
right now 
um 
i'm a senior 
i'm gonna get 
done with this i swear 
it's hard 
it's very hard i mean i missed a lot of school 
i mean 
and most people would think that i have a lot of help 
but i really don't 
mean i live with my parents and everything 
and 
i mean 
they have jobs too it's not like 
you know when he's 
up 
at night 
i 
i hafta do it 
my responsibility now 
and i mean people think 
that you know 
oh you get a lot of help no 
they have their lives i have mine 
um we're using his aunt 
right now i mean she stays home with her daughter 
and she's got one on the way 
and so she watches him while i'm in school 
it's not a long period of time i'm only there till ten o'clock 
yeah 
i mean i can practically graduate already i have all the credits 
but then you have those required classes that you hafta take 
so 
yeah 
that's it 
i get wick 
that is 
it 
um 
i have a class 
at um 
high school that it's called grads 
and it's like um 
you know 
all the kids in there 
are people that have kids 
or that are having kids 
and i mean we talk about 
that's all we do is sit in there and talk about 
our kids and what they're doing and 
how our parents and them reacted like there was this girl that just got in there today and 
and her parents 
flipping out because she's pregnant and um 
we were telling we were all telling her about how you know um 
it it always starts out that way 
and they will ease up later on 
yeah 
and 
the one girl had um 
showed her 
their  her ultra sound and then 
that's when it was like ah it's so cute and like well wait a minute i thought you was against it 
they're not always against it though 
yeah 
it's 
my baby and then 
oh 
you're having a baby that's 
i don't want to let you go syndrome 
um 
figures 
everyone loses their funding 
hum 
hum 
oh yeah 
oh no 
we just had a whole conversation come on now 
oh 
okay 
it doesn't have like the equalizer thingy 
oh it does yeah 
my boyfriend would love to mess with this i just want you to know that he'd be like 
taking it apart 
putting it back together 
uh it sucked 
no it sucked 
i mean i 
i don't have it like my sister 
she's 
puking every day 
mean she gets up 
she gets up it wakes her up at five o'clock and she does it all day 
i never 
i never puked not once 
i was 
but it was 
like the feeling's like 
i'm hungry right now 
that bothered me because 
i wasn't like a real heavy eater 
and then all of a sudden it's like i want to eat that and that and that 
get me this and 
oh it was crazy 
it was weird 
yeah 
i mean 
i 
didn't have back problems or anything like that 
but it was just like the feeling it was like 
i'm not right 
oh i hafta eat 
it that's like 
they it and they  
what made me mad about it 
is because everyone always thinks you're mad at them 
and 
oh 
she's snapping she's pregnant back off you know it's like 
i'm just 
saying you know 
yeah 
oh yeah i was ready 
oh yeah 
it's like let's go come on 
well yeah because uh 
i would've had 
lots of epidural 
because they induced me 
because my doctor said hey 
it's time 
we can do this 
so i got it lucky even though i kind of wanted it 
have it 
you know normal 
and um 
you know to look at him and go oh 
my water broke 
oh no and watch him flip out you know like on movies 
but um 
he  
i we we  we didn't get to do that so 
and like just 
through the first 
three hours and you don't really 
start to feel it and 
and then you really do and i was 
that little pain that i did feel my mom's like 
oh 
try doing it the whole time you know 
and 
it  
i was 
crying the whole time just that little pain my mom was laughing at me it wasn't funny 
and 
to what they left out parts you know if you talk to people 
when they have babies 
and they 
oh it's the worst pain but you will forget about it 
they left out that whole part where they put the epidural in you 
and 
you 
you puke up 
you know you 
left that part out 
totally left that part out 
no one filled me in about no throwing up or anything 
that 
that really made me 
leaving out stuff man 
oh 
yeah 

i'm not sure i mean i know no one's come 
to like 
hey you can get on this and you can get on that 
i mean i know my teacher 
she said 
i think it's called 
um 
a d h or something 
and they pay you to go to school 
they could be paying me to go to 
finish high school 
and they can also 
they will also 
pay me 
to finish college 
and and they will help me out 
you know 
i haven't seen anyone 
come to offer me that 
or or tell i mean she's the first 
i never even heard of it 
and um 
there's  there's all kinds of programs that you know 
like there's this one that um 
where 
like say 
i 
i live with my mom 
my mom can be getting paid from the government for me to be living there 
you know because 
she kind of helps me out you know 
and 
i don't know what that was called i mean 
i'm just now finding this stuff out you know 
it's like 
i guess 
i can apply for um 
welfare and that 
i mean not that i 
i don't want to be on welfare it's like 
it's like a 
a down 
when i want to go up 
you know 
yeah like have someone come and 
you know 
and tell them  
you have this much time or 
you know i wouldn't recommend you stay on this program this long 
and  
i i know there's programs that 
if you get on it and they pay you 
you hafta pay that money back after 
you get on your feet 
well i mean 
i think 
someone should be able to come out and 
and tell you about these things and 
let you know what you can and 
hafta do to 
you know do this 
or she she um 
she doesn't know all about all of them you know 
like 
i get she  
found out about the a d h 
just like we all 
you know 
and i guess 
like a couple of the kids in the class had  
had it 
or 
on it you know 
and she was like oh what's that and she was like oh i hafta figure out that stuff you know 
she called 
uh one of the case workers and figured out the whole program and she come in and told another girl about it 
she told me about it 
hum 
uh edward 
the fourth 
edward the fourth 
it's 
his dad 
his dad's dad and his dad's 
yeah he's the father definitely 
hum 
yeah he lives with me and 
i mean that's my engagement ring 
very big 
i   
probably 
down the line because like 
we're still struggling to 
get up 
you know 
we're waiting for that million dollar 
twenty one million dollar check to hit the 
the doorstep you know 
i'm finishing high school um 
actually heard about a program where you can 
finish college on the internet 
but i'm not sure how it's gonna work 
you know i mean 
i 
i 
the 
o s u's um web site is  under construction 
i was like 
darn it 
so then  
you know my aunt works here and um 
all my cousins well  
most of them graduated here so 
kind of want to follow them 
go with the flow but 
i you know i did some other ones you know emailed 
and 
you know 
if you have this program can you tell me something about it and 
and it was actually i think it was stanford it was on a 
tv show i think it was like extra or something i don't know what it was 
and they were 
had a program on where um 
these older students 
you know 
met for the first time in uh 
uh 
at their graduation 
you know they 
finished their whole 
college on the internet 
and i said well that would be very 
easy for me 
and i could do it at my convenience like when he's asleep i can go and do that 
i think it would make it a lot easier 
to get up 
getting up is a very hard task 
very big bags like i can't see 
at the beginning he did 
perfectly but now he's doing this 
i want up at four o'clock kind of thing 
and you give him a bottle and he goes back to sleep but 
you know i don't want to walk all way 
to make bottle for him at 
four o'clock 
it's like i can't see feeling my way through the hallways and stuff 
well yeah sort 
oh man 
whoa 
everyone's like 
you got it lucky 
i'm like 
well it's gonna catch up just wait 
i'm waiting for it 
i don't know what i'm gonna do but i'm waiting for it 
um 
well if he has that bottle at four 
he will wake 
maybe up around six or seven 
i normally wake up at six anyway so it doesn't matter 
so i'm ready for him then 
yeah 
hum 
even harder 
no i think we're only friends inside the class i mean 
a lot of them i've known  
um from middle school and following them up and you know they just all go their different ways 
like the one girl i was friends with at world park 
i mean she was a grade lower than me but when that we seen each other in the halls like hey what's up and 
and we'd 
talk and 
you know what's going on and 
we're doing this after school and that 
in high school 
i didn't 
know anything i 
i know she was 
bad 
and that was it 
that was all i knew 
and it it's kind of weird because 
you 
when i went from middle school to high school it was like a big growing up period 
and i see them like 
what are you doing that for 
you're grounded oh 
yeah 
what'd you do 
oh god you know  i feel like a  
i was a parent before i was a parent you know 
i've 
that's the way it felt it was like 
some of my friends like 
like this guy i used to hang out with he 
he used to run into lockers 
in high school i'm like  that is so kid 
yeah just to watch the people go 
what did you just do that for you know 
and i'm like 
and what grade are you in 
and how old are you 
and 
i know like one point in time it's like we don't want to hang out with you crystal i'm like 
well fine i don't 
i will go hang out with them 
it's like they 
they still need to do a lot of growing up 
they 
most of my friends are 
they're  they act like kids 
no unfortunately not 
yeah because i have a like a problem with 
um 
getting to know people you know like 
i'm shy at first 
and um 
then it takes you know a while you know get to know the person and 
then i become friends with them 
it's like for some reason i didn't want to do that 
um 
columbus public 
oh 
yeah 
not really 
i mean 
yeah there's some 
little flaws but 
mean 
the way i grew up it was probably like back in the day 
like 
the catholics against the columbus publics 
you know like 
the richies against the poories 
that's how i kind of see it 
but when i went to northland people were 
think 
northland's like a rich school 
but the way i see it is 
no not really 
i mean we do live in a big  
you know housed 
area you know the houses are like huge 
but um 
um 
i mean columbus public  
they 
they got some work to do too 
like 
the other night i was watching tv and 
uh 
an elementary school 
overdosed a kid on 
like some 
a  
i think it was a drug to 
calm him down so he's not so hyper 
and they like 
overdosed him like twice in a day 
and then when he goes home his mom's even overdosing him because he 
they're 
overdosing him 
yeah 
i mean he's 
he  
they were supposed to do it one time and then she was supposed to give him one 
dose 
and they were giving him three doses 
yeah 
whoops 
that's 
i don't i didn't see that part i missed the beginning and 
all i seen was 
the the chart and i was like 
whoa 
you know that 
that's 
one reason 
why i would 
hesitate to put my kid in a columbus public 
just like um 
the daycare 
uh i don't 
i don't think i would want my kid to go to daycare 
crazy 
a week 
didn't like it huh 
oh yeah 
i don't know about that 
yeah 
he hasn't shown that period yet i don't know if he's supposed to be showing it now or not 
because um 
i mean 
when he goes to his aunt amy's you know it's 
bye mom you know 
look up okay bye 
that's it 
yeah 
from the day one 
the day i left the hospital he was 
running around with him and he 
look my son 
whoa 
um 
hum 
maybe i will move to australia 
i don't know 
i mean 
i think it's kind of ridiculous 
for kids to pay 
to chew gum 
you know or 
if they get caught chewing it desalles my all my cousins went to desalles 
and 
if they got  
caught chewing gum 
they had to pay 
they had the paid 
i'm like what 
it's a catholic school 
all the 
i was like  i would not 
i will chew gum when i want 
um 
like 
one of my friends 
he had um 
a car alarm 
because he had some nice stuff in his car 
his car alarm went off during 
school and he said 
he 
put his hand up and everything and told her that he 
needed to go outside because his car alarm was going off 
and um she said no you can do that on your time sit down 
he got all his stuff stolen out of his car 
it's like 
well 
there that went you know 
why 
i mean you can't even have nice stuff in your car anymore 
i don't know 
i don't know i mean 
i was actually looking at that riser military and then they started 
popping up all this 
abuse stuff and i was like 
man 
darn 
it's like my aunt 
his 
my boyfriend's 
aunt and uncle they 
their 
their kid is 
has that 
really hyperness um 
a d h d 
and um 
they do this 
they were trying to make it to where they 
he would calm down and they wouldn't hafta give him so much medicine 
and she reads a lot of magazines and 
articles about 
you know the problem 
and um 
i guess uh 
he  
uh 
if you change their diet if you take out milk or something i think it was 
did you know twizzlers had milk in them 
you  i  
oh really 
i was like 
whoa milk in twizzlers 
whoa 
um 
that that 
it's like whoa 
milk is in 
and um 
so they change his um 
diet around and watch i mean they're only 
right now they're eating 
they're on a 
organic 
diet 
now i don't know if i could afford that but um 
i would think it would be cheaper 
organic food 
because i mean you could actually grow that stuff but it's kind of wintery now so 
can't grow nothing right now 
um 
it kind of 
well i've seen worser 
um 
so i 
they're doing this 
i think it's called sit and reach where he's got to sit on the floor and he's got to raise his feet up just so 
and 
and he's got to 
take his hands and reach towards his toes 
and 
he they do that for 
you know like  
five minutes first time and they increase it 
and he really hates it 
but it 
it's teaching him discipline responsibility 
you can't do these things at this time you know 
i 
yeah 
so he's not so crazy 
she was doing this thing where um 
if 
he did a good 
job on something she would give him like a fake coin 
he'd put it in his bank 
and 
at the end of the week or something he could cash it in and get a video or a video game or something you know 
that shows responsibility 
too 
but 
hum 
i think i'm gonna 
uh 
what i really like the riser military because it shows discipline 
responsibility 
respect 
for 
you go to a columbus public school and 
the kids will lash out on substitute teachers i think it's really crazy 
um 
i think you should have 
a lot more 
respect for 
your elders your adults 
so 
he works 
he 
he dropped out and um 
hum that's where i come into play you know i want to 
i want to be the one 
that has a high school i  
think one of us should have a high school diploma 
um 
he says he's 
gonna probably go back and get his g e d but it's like 
when 
when do you have the time hon 
you know um 
he works so 
much it's like 
when 
um 
he's a subcontractor and 
if uh someone's got a job to do at their house he he will do it 
you know like 
we we just went 
and tore the cabinets out of a 
a house that was on fire 
and 
because the smoke damage 
so 
i mean carrying cabinets and 
he will do it 
long as you're paying him he will do it 
yeah 
i'm actually like 
a month older than him 
we're in the same age range 
i said that and he's like 
you you wouldn't 
i know 
right off the bat 
i wouldn't be able to make as much money as him 
maybe if i do this college thing i would whack him out of the 
price range but 
um 
yeah 
uh we're 
yeah we're into that well i'm into that i'm into the competitive thing 
um 
but you know 
yeah i 
i 
he comes home and it's like 
will you take him 
and he's like 
why i just got home i'm tired i'm like 
okay 
you sit at home with him 
all day okay 
and you go 
i talk to him 
like 
i would do it like 
i'm talking to you 
he's just sitting there okay that's not 
and 
he comes home 
you're talking to him 
yeah it's not like 
you're here to talk to 
and he just looks at me like you are so weird 
and 
hey 
i will talk to the tv like during 
jerry springer or something 
you're so wrong 
people look at me like 
okay 
like 
i sit at home all day 
yeah 
that's true 
books reading 
well i think it's normal to read books and stuff but you know you're sitting there 
or 
you're like reading a magazine 
did you know what this guy did you know look down at him 
did you see what this guy did 
and 
just looked up at you like what are you 
he smiles at me when i talk to him 
so 
it 
i mean 
uh he 
he's responding 
that's a good way 
yeah 
being goofy 
i 
think 
later on when he gets a little older 
he will be 
you know hey 
cool 
you know 
when he can wrestle with him and all that right now he's just 
he sits there and 
when he cries he goes 
what does he want 
like i know go down the list hon change his diaper or  if he 
it's been 
three hours since he's had a bottle give him a bottle you know 
play with him 
take him in on the kitchen floor so he can roam around 
because our kitchen is like 
open 
and there's like nothing in it 
and uh 
you know 
it's like go down the list that's what i do what do 
he just thinks i 
automatically know i'm a mind reader 
that's what it is 
oh yeah 

that's when you take him to grandma 
that's what we do 
heh  
he's got to 
grandma night 
because 
we live with my mom and dad so he gets to see 
my side all the time 
but he doesn't get to see them as much so it's like when that night comes along good 
go to grandma 
or like we take to  to her like movies and  
when we want to go see a movie 
and because 
his mom gets uh those free 
tickets 
for a m c's 
for um not 
getting 
hurt 
she works at fedex 
and um 
her crew 
is always getting hurt 
mainly her 
uh she ran a forklift 
a 
and 
busted her nose and chipped her tooth 
she's just a dangerous woman 
and um 
so uh she gets a lot of tickets 
sometimes when 
getting hurt 
when she's not running into poles 
stuff 
um 
and you know we will use them because they don't they normally go to 
the movie store and just get a movie and bring it home 
we do that a lot too but 
we haven't been there in a while but 
i mean we do go 
not since the new year started we haven't been 
i like scary um 
i think he's into scary action 
you know 
like 
whatever his name is 
arnold schwarzenegger 
he's into his kind of movies 
i like the  
i liked sixth sense 
i loved that movie 
that movie was 
good 
makes you 
think 
like right now i'm cold and 
when you see it you will know what i'm talking about like coldness 
you watch the movie 
you're like 
whoa 
oh yeah i'm 
all i always wear t shirts i don't 
i'm a t shirt person 
i don't like 
things on my arms like 
like i don't like bracelets or anything 
yeah i guess i just have the nerve to scratch and stuff 
like my rings i will twist them because they bother me 
like i don't wear this a whole lot and 
it's one of the days i did 
oh yeah 
well clown cone isn't there 
clown cone uh you could get like a bag of um tootsie rolls and pay only five cents 
so um 
that's gone 
that was a kid thing 
um 
my grandfather used to own 
m market 
and uh the changes at m and m is 
like a lot 
it's got robbed a lot more 
because my grandfather kept a shotgun underneath the counter but 
um 
um 
easton 
um 
easton is crazy 
um 
crazy bad 
like the prices in the stores are like 
way outrageous to me 
crazy 
um the mall i don't even 
like 
north land mall 
i wish would stay because 
i mean 
it's close to where i live 
um 
i've 
been going there all my  
since i was born probably 
um 
so 
that and i heard 
i kind of liked 
the change they're talking about 
they're talking about putting 
underground power lines and taking the poles out 
and putting like the 
the street lights they have at easton 
so i think that's kind of nice 
i am not agreeing with 
my grandma  
she seems to think 
okay maybe 
but if you put a discount store in there i would love it 
that's what she said i was like  
no where north land is 
when north land moves and all that 
that 
the existing building she thinks they should turn into a discount store 
there's this one that's like out in wisconsin or something she said and 
was really nice and she had been there like a couple of times and she says they should put one right 
she said that will make up for it 
um 
i  i know my aunt works at j c penney's i know j c penney's 
and lazarus are both 
moving their existing stores 
to polaris 
so there will still be a sears and a  
or i mean j c penney's and a lazarus but they're moving to polaris 
um 
and i i don't know if they're gonna tear down that  
i don't know what they're gonna do with that 
existing area 
mean they could actually 
well 
yeah 
they could actually make it to where they could put homeless people or something 
feed them or something 
you know 
that's a big building what are you what you gonna do with it 
um 
like a little coffee shop 
like the 
continent 
there's apartments above them 
yeah 
hum 
put bathrooms and kitchens and stuff 
i like computers i like 
yeah 
we um 
we have two computers in our house and they both 
have internet 
on them 
and um 
it's called 
all advantage 
and 
they will pay you to go to websites 
and it's like twenty five cent an hour or something i don't remember what it was 
but we haven't got a check yet but 
i'm not sure i don't know 
his 
his dad found it and told me about it because i wasn't working at the time 
and we were trying to get an 
extra income to come in 
and um 
his dad made 
actually like twenty five dollars or something 
you know 
i would think he'd make more than that because 
man 
every time we go over there he's up on the computer doing something 
so 
and i'm on there 
you know just 
i look up baby stuff get coupons and stuff 
um 
you know like 
reading about 
things that happen to people 
like 
their kids spitting up in their face or something 
um you know it's stuff like that it's like 
it's 
kind of neat 
because you don't have to pay 
well you have to pay for it but 
like magazines 
i like it better than a magazine 
something like that 
i don't i don't know much about it 
but i think 
get 
computers is going to really dominate 
you know 
i mean 
soon like 
fedex and 
it's probably gonna be 
there's 
probably gonna be no one working there 
they're probably gonna make it all  
machinery you know 
but then you will have to have people running the machinery and checking the machinery 
so hey 
yeah 
i haven't done that yet i haven't bought anything off the internet yet 
i don't know something about giving my credit card number away is kind of hum um 
i don't think so 
oh yeah i was like  
my 
ed was like 
oh i got to figure out how to 
well it's like you can't do that 
flipped out 
yeah he 
he broke into like 
oh my god i can't remember what it was but 
he had 
all these numbers for credit cards 
and he was 
threatening to 
uh sell them on the internet 
if they didn't give him what he wanted 
i was like  
and ed was like oh we could get 
i was like no 
oh 
did they 
i don't think so 
i don't think so i don't think they did 
um 
but there was this other guy 
my mom was talking about the other day 
i don't know what she seen it on i guess he had did something like that 
and you know he was just listing 
they 
did like an interview with him 
and um 
told them how much 
you know things he did like he did this and that and 
i guess he 
broke into bank ones or something like that and 
got some accounts or something like that and i was like 
whoa 
yeah that is 
oh yeah 
yeah 
i could check my account 
see how much money i have 
i got and 
they will actually list things that i've bought you know 
like how many 
your your  account 
and all that 
what you've bought 
check clearing so you can see if checks cleared 
do my um 
billing and stuff 
microsoft money 
okay 

huh 
where are  uh 
where you from you say 
in where 
oh uhhuh 
well uh 
i was born on a homestead 
out  
northern montana 
and then my parents moved back to iowa which was their 
home 
area 
southern iowa 
and i grew up there 
attended high school there 
and then i uh 
went to iowa state for five quarters and 
i just 
didn't get it 
and  uh 
i worked around home for a 
a year and then i  
went into the army in 
nineteen forty 
spring of nineteen forty one before pearl harbor 
and i was in  
service for uh 
four and a half years 
in 
italy most of that time  
north africa and then italy 
and uh 
i 
had met a 
uh a  
uh girl before i went in the service and 
so when i got 
home why we were married and 
she had family out here in columbus 
she was originally from southern ohio 
but uh 
when i was gone she came 
to columbus and so 
i came here when i was discharged 
and i uh 
served an apprenticeship in a sheet metal worker shop 
or well 
it was 
more than just i mean there's more than shop work we did 
erection work too and commercial work 
and uh 
i stayed with that until uh 
well for twenty five years however 
whenever that was 
then i got a chance to uh 
go to work for the city of columbus as a  heating and ventilating inspector 
and i decided that it was 
that was more my speed when i was that age so 
i worked for them 
for the city as a 
inspector for 
twelve and a half years 
till i retired 
and uh 
my wife and i had 
four children 
four 
or three boys and a daughter 
my sons all live here in columbus and 
my daughter's out in seattle 
in the redmond area 
i've been 
active in 
church work sunday school all my life 
and uh 
tried to get my 
family 
in it 
with some success not  not as much as i'd like 
but uh 
i think they're all 
responsible 
well adjusted people and 
have families of their own i have 
nine grandchildren 
one great grandson 
and uh 
and the boys are all in the sheet metal trade also 
one of them's working over here on the 
the uh stadium 
and uh 
i don't know just exactly where the others are but they're  
here in the 
columbus area 
my daughter's a school teacher who's been 
teaching 
for 
i don't know ever since she got her degree 
and 
her husband works for a 
a uh 
testing 
company 
that 
does 
testing with uh 
i don't know very much about it 
probably shouldn't even say 
but  
uh with uh 
ultra or 
something or other ultrasound 
equipment 
and 
it's really sort of interesting 
and let's see 
my 
my youngest son's wife is a 
teacher in the 
catholic schools elementary schools 
and 
my  
my second son's wife 
works 
for the 
columbus school 
system 
as a secretary and 
uh 
actually transcribing notes for 
people 
who uh for men who've 
are 
writing books or papers or whatever 
and then uh 
my 
oldest son's 
wife is 
a secretary  
in the 
in the school 
in a 
she's 
works  
in a school building and 
she hears all the 
troubles and 
sad stories 
let's see 
i don't know 
that's basically 
who i am 
hum 
yeah 
well 
i we were in north africa first 
for the north african 
campaign when rommel was still 
roaming and then 
when uh 
that ended up 
in the summer of 
fall of nineteen forty two i believe 
and uh 
then we  
were sent to italy i was in the field artillery outfits 
uh six inch guns 
and uh 
well actually 
a neighbor boy 
whose 
draft number was 
smaller than mine 
uh 
i don't know where he got the contact but anyway 
he 
went up to boone iowa and joined a national guard outfit 
uh 
which was field artillery 
and uh 
with the expectation of their being mobilized 
soon 
which they were 
and uh 
so he 
he was home one weekend and talked to me about it and i thought well 
field artillery i was exposed to that when i was uh 
in r o t c at ames 
so i thought that's 
be better than 
carrying a rifle and 
so i went up with him and i joined up 
and uh 
so anyway 
we  
six inch 
howitzers 
which had a range of 
about sixteen miles 
and uh 
the shells were 
about ninety five pounds 
and they 
the high explosive shells had thirty seven pounds of t n t in them 
so they'd make 
quite a bang when they went off 
and 
field artillery is really  or i found it really interesting because 
those uh 
when you get into figuring 
firing data 
get lost in mathematics almost back then you could of course 
now they probably have 
computers that 
figure it out and just zip zip 
and uh 
oh 
and then they uh 
we had to 
locate our positions on a map 
and 
i didn't do that myself 
but we had a couple boys in the outfit who 
could 
uh 
find where we were on a map and 
where our 
o p our observation post was and 
where the enemy out here was and all that 
and uh 
it's uh 
it  it is  was interesting 
uh 
calculating 
trying to calculate 
where your shells were gonna land out there 
i was up  
i was 
only on the o p a few times but 
one time when we 
had a uh 
second lieutenant up there who was very 
well congenial i guess is as good a word as any 
and uh 
what we'd do is sometimes 
when we'd get into an area and we'd know that we'd had a field out here we'd be shooting to 
we would adjust on a target out there we'd pick a 
a building or some target there we could see 
and we'd 
adjust the guns call down 
shifts 
until they could come within 
reasonable 
close to that 
and then 
we we'd know where 
to shift from there to another target 
and uh 
he let me fire it 
one 
once 
range but 
i got about 
fifty or seventy five yards from the 
what we were shooting 
which would 
um 
see with those 
guns our of ours we figured 
within ten  
ten yards was a hit 
was a  
and because 
if you had one of those things 
thirty seven 
pounds of t n t go off within ten yards of it 
yeah 
we 
we had uh 
counter battery fire we called it which 
when they were shooting back at us 
once 
in north africa was 
kind of 
scary 
uh 
we were in position where we 
could fire on a 
a uh tank battle that was going on we had a  
forward observer up there 
where he could look down and see the whole thing 
and so he was adjusting fire and 
i don't know how many 
tanks they claimed that we hit but 
course with ours 
if you hit 
you didn't have to hit them direct you could hit them right beside them and flip them over 
and they were out of it 
so uh anyway 
we had a fine field day that one day 
uh firing at them 
the next morning about ten o clock 
we heard one   uh heard a shell coming in and it was an air burst back of us about five hundred yards 
and then in a little bit there's another one 
other side of us 
he was adjusting on us 
and we 
couldn't do we didn't catch onto where it was right away but 
by the time we 
started 
looking for our 
holes which 
weren't deep enough 
we 
realized that he was in a clump of 
of cactus 
over on an adjoining hill 
oh about 
half a mile away i guess 
and he was getting even for the day before 
but uh 
the first lieutenant who was 
our um 
in command of the battery at that time 
said let's get the hell out of here 
so 
there was a 
a wadi they call them it's like a 
little deep wash 
that 
ran down 
oh a hundred two hundred yards from the gun position so 
we took off down there 
and they 
proceeded to set 
i think they set two of our guns on 
the battery i mean the 
tires on fire 
and they set the ammunition on fire 
they just 
shot our gun position up pretty good 
and uh 
and that night 
finally they 
well i don't know exactly how we 
we got a hold of back to our headquarters but anyway we did and 
so they sent the 
prime movers 
which 
the 
the trucks which we moved the guns with 
out 
and uh 
we hitched what was  remaining 
of the guns on them and 
went back wondering now 
they gonna put us in the infantry or something we don't have any 
artillery guns 
but uh 
i don't know it wasn't but 
a couple or three days 
they had 
more guns i mean more artillery pieces up there for us to 
use 
and then 
one other time after in italy 
or when we were in italy 
we  they moved us into a position that we should have never been in 
we were 
well let's see we come  uh around a mountain like there's a mountain here 
and there not a 
real  high mountain but a mountain 
and in the front of it there was a little kind of a 
dip 
and then on out and the 
enemy was over there 
well they put us in the front of that mountain right down 
i don't think that there's any question they could look right down our throats because 
and anyway we fired a 
a couple times from there 
and they  started firing back at us and man 
scared me 
i had my 
my head was that far below the surface 
in a hole and i was still 
uh shaken 
but uh 
and i don't remember 
i think they put one of our guns out of commission that time but they didn't do 
as much damage as 
they might have 
those were the two worst 
things 
when we were in north africa 
there was 
one 
german gun that was 
firing on us and 
and they couldn't figure where he was 
and finally uh i don't know whether there were 
we had uh a 
piper cub observation plane i don't know whether he saw him 
or 
who but anyway 
they finally 
figured that he was in a 
a  a tunnel for the railroad 
and he'd 
pull out 
fire a couple rounds pull right back in 
so uh 
that night our captain who 
who's one of these 
go go guys 
took one of our guns from a gun crew 
they went up to where they could 
line  
line  
aim on that 
opening of that tunnel 
and 
fired a couple 
of our shells into the tunnel and then took off 
so i don't know 
whether  
they did any damage or not but 
if there were any germans in there i will bet they scared 
no 
no we we 
the uh the only germans i ever saw were 
p o w's 
uhhuh 
well we 
we went in 
at naples 
which is pretty well to the south  
end of italy 
and we went up 
through the 
mountains we didn't see  
well 
went up to uh 
let's see now 
well we went uh 
about half way up to 
between naples and rome 
and we were stopped at 
one of their defensive lines 
and uh 
then 
they 
powers that be you know 
american army decided well 
we will go up to 
this little area of uh 
oh i was there six months or four months 
anzio 
you've heard of the anzio beachhead 
we will go up there 
and get around behind them 
and uh so they went up there 
but the germans 
caught on pretty quick and they made it pretty hot 
and that 
area 
of anzio was 
just flat as this table almost 
for an area 
back from the  
mediterranean back probably 
ten miles 
there's ten or twelve miles 
long the coast long 
and uh 
so we the 
we had enough area to 
manipulate in 
and it was crisscrossed with deep 
uh 
uh 
ditches of some kind i don't know whether they were 
irrigation ditches or what 
which we used as 
fortification 
but uh 
but even so 
the uh 
we were on this and the 
germans were up on the mountains all around us where they could 
again look right down at us 
so we didn't go out in the daylight hardly at all 
and then uh 
after so long a time after 
i don't know how long 
they 
again the powers that be said well 
we will fool them we will 
fog up that whole area with smoke 
and as long as the wind wasn't too 
high 
well they could do it 
mean you 
they  
fogged it up to where you could hardly see your hand out here 
that way well at least we could move around a little bit 
but uh 
we sat there then 
for 
oh and 
it was kind of funny 
we were  uh there's 
another guy and i and 
the 
the lieutenant who was  
forward observer 
were going out to a 
forward  
observation post and 
they uh 
observation 
lieutenant whatever his  title was 
was guiding he was in one jeep ahead of us and we were following him 
and of course we just had these little 
red 
blackout lights they called them 
we were following his jeep 
we kept going and we kept going and 
this other g i and i were sitting in the back and i said hey 
suppose they know the german 
but uh 
anyway 
they finally got out 
we finally out out to where there was a bunch of 
ruined farm  
or  ruined farm house and farm buildings and so on 
and uh 
they said well this is it 
so uh 
there and there were some 
g i's 
infantry men around there and 
so uh 
we started looking around for a place to land i mean 
got our bed rolls out 
so on and 
the next morning 
i don't know i guess i was looking for a 
somebody who had a fire there warm up some 
some uh rice and something 
anyway 
one of the first guys i saw 
was a guy that had worked with my wife in the office there 

and uh 
so 
i got some of the inside dope 
on uh the area from him 
but uh 
they had 
there's a 
i know whether it been a large grainery or something that had a concrete floor 
and some 
industrious g i had 
chipped a hole about 
so big around in that 
and dug out the dirt under it 
so that he got down in a 
an area under that concrete floor 
the concrete was about so deep which 
better than that much dirt 
so uh 
whenever they 
we heard any 
firing like it was coming toward us why 
we'd 
head for that hole 
oh let's see 
i've already told you more than i ever told anybody else i think 
oh 
at  at anzio you said oh 
uhhuh 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
one of my kids got it for me 
it 
i don't know 
and 
well i don't think he 
exaggerated but he uh 
he was selective about the people that he 
he described in there 
which 
purpose of his book i suppose 
uh 
and of course bill mauldin was 
the greatest 
you  have you seen his 
cartoons and 
uh haven't you 
well he 
his two main  uh 
main characters in his cartoons were willie and joe 
two 
g i's 
and uh 
oh 
they saw the 
the ragged end of the war 
according to that 
and 
so uh 
i can't think what some of their observations were but 
there's usually just one or two 
lines of 
of dialogue under one of their 
their cartoons and the cartoon told 
most of it 
there was one 
where they were going along and 
there's a little 
uh 
scroungey looking dog about so long and about that high kind of following along after them 
joe 
i'm glad that i finally 
see somebody i can be sorry for that's worse  worse off than i 
what 
under the conditions that had to prevail i was treated well enough 
it was uh 
part of the time 
i don't feel like i've 
gained anything from it that i didn't deserve i mean 
in the way of 
benefits 
huh 
well that and 
see uh 
they had the g i bill of rights 
which was 
a boon to 
thousands and thousands of guys my age 
and 
when i started as an apprentice 
in the shop they said well 
we will start you at a dollar an hour 
well i thought that sounds pretty good you know in nineteen forty five 
in the fall of nineteen forty five 
so then 
as things worked out in washington d c 
they came out with the g i bill of rights 
we found out that uh that would apply to apprentices too 
and so uh 
soon as my 
shop found out that i could 
draw that 
whole 
ninety dollars a month 
i mean whoo 
they said well 
since you're getting that 
why we will 
cut 
cut your pay back to what 
you would 
normally draw under the apprenticeship program 
which was fifty seven cents an hour 
and 
for a 
to support a wife and a  small baby on that was 
kind of tough going 
well 
uh 
i was 
exposed to a lot of 
men who were not 
brought up with as i was 
but there were a lot of them that were 
i mean uh 
like uh 
what's his name that who wrote the book you just 
yeah 
uh 
i was 
i think that he's 
he's right that our 
my generation 
was 
uh 
oh 
i want to don't want to say spiritual but more morally 
uh 
well directed than 
at least a lot of the  kids today 
i don't say that of all of the 
because i know that 
some of them 
were 
brought up right 
but uh 
well i was 
uh 
i 
i was pretty well 
established about responsibility and 
that sort of thing before i went into service 
i was the oldest son in a family of ten 
so uh 
i had some 
family responsibilities 
we were 
my brother and i and my sisters 
were active in the four h clubs 
which was a 
a going thing 
at that 
in the uh 
thirties 
and uh 
and did i say we 
went to church 
fairly regularly but 
to tell you the truth i can't 
remember too much that i 
taught then 
but i was exposed to it anyway and i'm 
i'm sure that some of it 
rubbed off on me 
well 
uh my youngest son 
married a catholic girl who was 
from a large catholic family 
and 
their kids are going to a catholic school 
now i think that 
those four kids at least among my grandchildren 
are 
getting pretty much at the same 
training that i did or maybe better than i got 
uh 
my oldest son's two daughters 
well they're good kids and they're smart kids 
but i don't think that they have the 
moral grounding 
that uh 
greg and beth's kids do 
you said this is all confidential 
and my 
but now my daughter's 
my daughter has twin sons 
who just 
are a year out of 
college 
and uh 
i think that they are 
they 
one of them particularly is 
i think in 
good moral 
good sort of guy and 
the other one 
i don't feel like i know as well but 
i 
i really think that they're 
both 
good 
and uh 
see 
uh 
i can't 

i don't know 
i 
i think 
those kids are uh 
they're lack something in their upbringing 
and i don't know what it is 
um 
thank goodness none of my kids ever 
took that sort of attitude 
and uh 
i'd like to 
i'd like to think that my wife and i 
set them a good example 
my wife was a 
uh 
very conscientious 
hard working woman 
she 
established a 
secretarial 
business there at our  
uh 
for several years 
and uh 
anything that went out of there was 
right 
i mean 
and uh 
she did 
well quite a lot of typing for students over here graduate students 
and 
so she i gave her most uh 
credit for 
our kids' upbringing 
her mother 
was a 
cousin of 
uh 
james thurber 
and 
was a 
a  a want to be writer i  mean her mother was 
she 
she wrote a 
well she wrote quite a number of poems and 
and 
paid to have them published in a small booklet 
and some of 
some of them were 
real good and some of them 
and 
my wife 
wrote some poetry too 
she'd be down there typing 
and she'd 
she always had these uh 
spiral notebooks 
and she'd 
stop and 
get an idea for a poem maybe from something she is working on or i don't know what but 
but anyway uh 
she  she wrote 
quite a few poems some of them 
real good poetry i thought 
most of them of  
more or less a 
religious nature 
and 
moral nature 
in fact uh 
i  
uh the 
desk that 
she had we 
we finished off part of our basement she had her office down there 
and uh 
her desk is still down there and 
one of the typewriters that she used but it's 
i don't know it's been disused too for too long i guess because i've tried type on it 
it uh 
doesn't shift like it should and so uh 
but anyway 
she hadn't 
i don't know 
how many these spiral notebooks around 
and she'd just write in them 
and uh 
since she passed away in nineteen seventy nine 
i have run across 
i 
well i just  finally decided well those notebooks are down there and 
if i need one for something i will just 
go ahead and use it 
and i've 
run across a couple of her poems that i didn't 
know anything about 
and then was 
or uh 
sort of 
good 
uh huh 
yeah 
huh 
i think so 
although 
she was 
working at her 
desk most the time so that 
she didn't give them as much attention as 
as uh 
a lot of mothers do 
but 
she was there 
and if they needed her 
for anything or 
needed her to say no to something 
she was there 
and uh 
yeah i think that uh 
that probably had something to do with it 
and the fact that our kids knew 
what 
our moral beliefs were 
and uh 
my oldest son 
uh completed 
what they call the god and country award in the church 
which is 
uh 
requires about as much 
work as uh 
eagle award 
in the scouts 
it's a 
a scout sponsored but church centered 
uh award 
and then my  second son 
got a his eagle award in the scouts 
i'm 
kind of proud of that 
because it 
uh 
well it's not something that a lot of kids do you know 
my oldest son 
was in vietnam 
yeah 
in fact 
he uh 
let's see i 
i  i don't remember but i suppose that they 
had a draft 
when he was about twenty one 
anyway he 
he went in for 
less than a year i think and then he was discharged 
and then he was called back 
in 
and 
sent to vietnam 
and it was uh 
sort of a traumatic experience for him 
that i think he has pretty well come out of but 
he was in a 
rural area he never was 
up where he was doing any shooting himself 
but uh 
he was on k p one day 
and uh 
he said they had a big 
an area 
out away from any of the other buildings where they burned trash and that sort of stuff 
so  he said the 
mess sergeant says um 
shoemaker take that 
can of trash out and uh 
and burn it and you 
probably better use 
take some gasoline to throw on the stuff 
to get it to burn 
so he did he went out there 
and 
threw some gasoline on it 
not 
knowing that one of the other  
k p's had been there ahead of him 
and thrown gasoline on it so there was 
i don't know how much gasoline on it 
when he threw a match on it 
it 
burned his 
his front anyway 
he got his hands up in front of his face so it didn't 
burn his face but it 
burned his legs and his 
stomach 
and uh 
so he was in a hospital in 
japan for some time 
and then 
came home 
but uh 
he never 
would never say a lot about it 
but he just 
didn't have a very high opinion of the army 
and then 
a couple of years later 
he was working on a job in 
the columbus coated fabrics plant which is 
plant that makes 
coated fabrics 
they make 
uh 
the main thing is uh auto upholstery car upholstery 
anyway 
they had big 
rolling machines that 
rolled this stuff out 
and there's fumes came off of it 
so they had 
a big hood and exhaust system 
above it 
and periodically they would have to clean those out because uh 
the fan would draw in addition to fumes they'd draw some lint off of this uh 
so he was up on top on these rollers 
cleaning out the hood 
and 
with supposedly 
nonflammable 
solvent 
but it wasn't because it caught 
fire 
and that time he was burned on the back 
he'd been burned 
front and back 
he was in the hospital burn ward for 
i don't know 
two or three weeks 
and it 
it was um 
the year that 
one of the years that 
ohio state played in the rose bowl now 
that's the nearest i can uh 
identify the time 
but uh 
and 
the  during the time that he was there 
a girl who he  he'd been going with just 
occasionally not real steady 
was there to see him every day 
when 
shortly after he 
was healed enough to go back to work 
why 
they were married 
and had the two daughters 
hum 
oh yeah 
that's too true 
it's uh 
hum 
well 

the 
objectives in vietnam 
were never 
clearly delineated 
and they were in italy 
and europe 
and uh 
there wasn't 
the definite 
enemy 
in vietnam that there was in europe 
i think that's part of it 
and of course the attitude of most of the 
guys that went to vietnam was 
a little bit different from 
from where i was probably is a consequence of 
our understanding of the 
the uh 
objectives 
because uh 
when we went 
into the service and then went overseas our 
objective was to 
do away with hitler and mussolini 
and uh 
i don't know they 
i'm just thankful that he 
he wasn't in a 
carrying a rifle in a rifle company or something because 
that was rough 
he uh 
told he never said much about it except he 
told about 
one time when he was in the 
hospital 
up in japan 
after he was burned 
he said that he was in a 
ward with a bunch of other 
burn patients and 
and he said the 
some of them and him included 
were able to get up and walk around 
so the 
and i can see their philosophy the 
medics 
had the guys that could walk 
help wait on the 
guys that were bed bound 
and uh 
he was 
had been helping 
one guy that was 
pretty bad off 
and this guy passed away 
didn't make it 
and so they 
started to put orrin get warren to 
do something else  
with some of the other guys 
i'm through i'm not working anymore with them he told them 
and they swore yes you are 
he said what are you gonna do send me back over to vietnam 
but they sent him home 
but he was 
he was uh 
not a very enthusiastic soldier i don't think at any time and 
especially after he came home 
now what 
yeah 
well 
i don't think that women should be on the front lines 
uh 
some women 
are  
are physically able to do 
what's needed 
some definitely aren't 
of course there's a 
same by the same token some men aren't 
but uh 
as  as support 
groups i think that's all right 
huh 
yeah 
i never heard a thing about it all the time i was in the service 
and i don't know 
whether orrin did or not he's never said anything if he has 
but uh 
i think my attitude would be 
uh 
don't tell and 
you know 
uh 
the 
the guys that  
come out in a very  
vociferously in favor of 
uh 
publicizing it and all that 
i don't see 
what they expect to gain 
i mean if 
they 
they uh 
in fact i don't  
i don't think that they do gain anything by it 
it wasn't publicized to the 
degree that it is now 
it seems like anymore nothing is sacred i mean as far as papers are concerned 
and uh 
there's something else that i 
i guess i'm old fashioned but i don't think 
we need all this publicity about 
all the sexual escapades of all the 
people that are 
or  
have  
lives 
uh 
i just 
uh 
i think maybe i'm old fashioned but i 
and they 
i can hardly 
conceive 
anyone being 
a genuine homosexual 
i mean evidently they are 
um but uh 
it's so against human nature 
i think 
or against conventional human nature anyway 
well there's been quite a change in attitude of 
the general public i  as far as  
work 
women working away from home is concerned 
and uh 
i don't know 
i'm glad that my wife 
was able to work there at home 
well 
actually she worked in an office when our first boy 
was just 
small 
but uh 
her mother 
stayed with us for 
several uh two or three years 
and she was a baby sitter for our oldest boy 
and uh 
she said well 
mary would just well go out and get a job 
she doesn't need to be 
sit around here 
i mean that was 
uh 
and 
she was a 
mary's mother was a 
kind of a 
free thinking uh 
uh 
not a liberal but 
uh 
well 
she went out 
when she was in her early twenties 
went out to  
north d or uh 
north or south dakota one or the other and homesteaded 
on a homestead 
and uh 
then while she was out there 
she met a 
a cowboy who 
was from also from ohio 
and uh 
they uh 
they were married while they were out there i guess 
but uh 
she was 
uh my son 
used to say she was a piece of work she 
she hadn't 
definite ideas about  
pretty near everything 

was it what 
oh 
sometimes 
she and mary had more 
disagreements than i ever had with her 
she would 
pamper the kids 
and 
well 
from where we lived there  
we lived just  i don't know whether you're acquainted with the north end of columbus but anyway indianola avenue is one of the main thoroughfares 
and uh 
we lived about a 
a block and a half off of indianola 
and then just 
another block 
was a small shopping center 
where there was a 
drug store and a 
barber shop and a 
a ten cent store 
theater 
i forget a couple other shops 
and um 
when orrin was 
about 
i don't know  
five five or  
maybe six or seven years old 
he had been explicitly told that he was not to go up there 
at all 
so 
one day 
grandma gave him 
i don't know a quarter or something 
and that burned his pocket till 
i don't know whether he went up with another neighbor kid or 
whether he went up 
on his own but he went up 
to the store 
and uh 
i think 
i don't know whether mary went up and got him or what anyway she found out he was up there 
so  
when i came home she told me what had happened and i said well 
that just can't be 
so i took him downstairs and paddled him 
and i've never been anything more said about it since then 
the only time i ever did 
paddle him but uh 
well i 
i told him 
you know i said 
something we 
told you you are not to do 
and you went ahead and did it 
so 
my parents homesteaded out there 
in nineteen 
eleven or twelve shortly after they were married 
they 
they'd 
go out there and there was um 
i suppose it was a county seat town 
and they'd file a claim on a certain area 
of 
land 
uh 
it was surveyed off and marked off 
in sections a section of land 
is uh 
six hundred and forty acres 
and that sounds like a lot of 
it is a good sized area 
but 
when you can't grow much of anything on it it's 
not that valuable 
but they  
that's what they thought though you 
get it for free well you 
and then you um 
you prove up on it as they say you 
you just 
build buildings a house and barn and 
and uh 
so that you could 
live on it 
and uh 
i think i don't know i suppose 
farm a certain amount of what i mean 
put in wheat or whatever 
and uh 
and after five years you get a title to it it's yours 
so they thought well gee you know free country free land 
to a farmer 
so uh 
they went out there but 
i 
dad said in 
the eleven years that they were out there 
they only raised 
three or four crops 
i mean 
it's just too dry it  
it wasn't really farming country 
and he went 
he went out there from iowa 
where you 
throw a kernel of corn out in the field and 
a stalk of corn would grow 
but uh 
that's how i 
see uh 
the 
only 
regular crop they had when they were out there my parents 
was kids 
there were six of us born out there 
and uh 
my oldest sister 
started to school out there 
and 
i don't know whether my  uh i don't think 
my second sister ever went to school out there 
but uh 
things were so tough that 
and mom had 
taught school in iowa 
where she grew up 
and uh 
got her teacher's certificate 
so 
i guess she and dad agreed that if they could 
find someone to stay with 
us kids through the day she could teach 
so she did 
i don't know whether it was 
more than a year or 
not 
for 
i think it was forty dollars a month 
and uh 
course that was forty dollars 
more than they had otherwise 
and uh 
then i think 
the 
let's see she 
well she went out there when bernice was going to school 
and bernice went to 
my oldest sister went to 
know whether it's first or maybe second grade out there 
says she 
she really thought that mom was the best teacher she ever 
uh 
then 
they hired a girl to come in as a hired girl 
and uh 
about the second or third day 
she was there 
she wasn't  wasn't feeling very good 
she had smallpox 
so uh 
they got us kids 
vaccinated in time but dad didn't i mean they 
didn't get vaccinated in time 
and he was 
just covered with 
those sores for i don't know how long 
uh 
mom said that 
after they started  
after the scabs started falling off of him 
why he'd get out the bed and 
she'd take the sheet out in the yard and 
shake it to get those scabs 
but uh 
yeah 
the 
the only uh 
the 
only people out there other than homesteaders were 
sheep herders 
there was this 
one guy 
had a 
so i don't know how many several herds of sheep 
and he'd hire 
uh 
i think they were mexicans 
as sheep herders 
and uh 
they were 
not 
desirable specimens other than for  
herding sheep 
and 
we'd come in 
dirty when 
mom was the uh 
dirty as an old sheep herder 
and then 
back of our house 
about 
i don't know five hundred yards 
there's a manmade 
lake 
or a small one 
and i don't know 
whether it was there when we moved there or not 
but anyway it was 
fairly good size i mean 
probably half mile a mile long and 
and out in the middle of it 
there was an island 
there'd been a small 
raised place out there 
and uh 
what i remember about it is 
one morning 
dad went out to milk and 
the 
milk cows were out on the on that island 
so and 
i don't know whether he had a boat or anyway there's a boat  to him and 
and 
he  
rowed across the island 
to milk the cows 
uh 
and then uh 
one day 
my two sisters older than i bernice and francis 
and i were outside playing and 
bernice i don't know whether bernice or me but one of us said well  
let's go down and wade in the lake 
and that was strictly no no 
well we started down there and 
francis the goody two shoes said 
i'm gonna tell mom 
and she did but we were out 
bernice had hiked up her 
skirts and i'd rolled up my pants leg and 
where i was probably not over knee deep 
but uh 
i think i was 
good talking too was all we ever got out of it 

i was born in los angeles california 
in the mid fifties 
and when i was 
less then one year old 
my family moved to columbus 
uh 
the 
first place we lived in columbus 
was in whitehall near the 
corner of 
hamilton and  uh 
um 
then 
shortly after that we 
moved out 
to reynoldsburg 
and i've i've 
lived there until my 
sophomore year in high school 
um 
went and during my sophomore year in high school we moved to 
and i graduated from  high school 
i went to oberlin college 
and then i 
i graduated from there in nineteen seventy six 
and 
moved back 
to 
columbus 
and 
did a variety of jobs 
in columbus 
um 
then i went to ohio state university 
from nineteen eighty three 
to 
ninety one 
and got a master's degree in geology 
so i'm an alumnus 
and um 
after that i 
had another 
variety of jobs 
um 
but i've 
lived 
and  
well during that time i guess i lived in the university area 
for a number of years 
i lived on sixteenth avenue 
near the fairgrounds 
um 
let's see 
i 
number of different jobs 
currently i work 
at uh 
in hilliard 
and i live in worthington 
uh 
in the 
south part of worthington i'm renting a room 
from my mom 
and i'm yes 
and i  sort of 
took a step backwards  
right now i'm saving up money and trying to buy a house somewhere 
it's 
something i'm sort of kicking myself 
wishing i would have done 
about 
twenty or thirty years ago cause it would have been a lot cheaper 
right right it wasn't a top 
for me then 
yeah 
one 
yeah 
i don't really have any 
childhood recollections of california 
yeah 
uhhum uhhum 
right 
well and i'm 
right now i'm 
forty 
five years old so i've lived 
in or around 
columbus 
for most of forty four years 
excluding times when i was away at school 
northern ohio 
it's 
near elyria 
which is west of cleveland 
yes 
uhhum 
right 
right 
uhhum 
i studied there i studied music and chemistry and 
ended up with a 
double major bachelors degree there 
not doing really at the same time 
studying music for a while and then studying chemistry 
yeah 
no i 
i  i didn't think of any projects where can use both 
uhhum 
well 
that's 
interesting 
thing  
i'm not 
in geology 
i 
um 
i'm actually making more money right now in 
music than i am in geology 
but i'm making most my money in something that's irrelevant to 
most my 
that has nothing to do with any of 
um 
yes i 
play 
um principle horn in the   uh symphony orchestra 
and um 
last year i was in a professional singing group 
but i'm also in a number of volunteer 
choirs 
um 
the 
choir at the first unitarian universalist church 
in 
and um 
a small 
choir where i work 
which i got the opportunity to conduct today 
the conductor 
was 
the conductor was 
um 
not at work 
so 
um 
i 
do a lot of music my 
spare time 
mostly 
uh 
but uh 
unfortunately i didn't 
get a 
job in geology 
and i 
i don't have a 
full time job music 
either 
either one of those would be nice but i 
um 
i went back 
i came back to ohio state 
um 
in 
see 
through ninety  
and got a 
teaching certificate in 
for secondary science 
and i taught 
for a year 
a 
at a small school in lancaster 
catholic 
high school 
down there 
and um 
left there 
uh 
part of was my fault i 
wasn't very good at discipline 
in the classroom 
so that was probably one of the biggest problems i had 
but uh 
no in fact the 
principal when she interviewed me 
asked me that 
and i 
when we're raised 
in the unitarian sunday school 
it's a 
it's 
almost an indoctrination in tolerance 
so you're better off with me then somebody that believes 
is the only one true religion 
yes 
but it was interesting um 
um 
they did have 
uh 
assemblies 
where 
they 
had religious assemblies um religion wasn't a 
all 
uh 
it 
wasn't all invasive in this school but 
they did have assemblies and 
uh 
for religious holidays and that kind of thing 
and 
i remember 
thinking 
uh 
it's 
it's interesting 
that 
the 
concept of 
eating 
somebody's flesh blood 
it's almost 
cult like 
and i'm 
and i'm starting to think 
well what really separates a 
a religion from a cult 
and  i think it's just  
this social acceptance of it really almost 
um 
you know how many people are in it 
what number 
divides them i'm not really 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
well i  i like 
um 
i 
was 
i've been very 
politically active at various times my past 
and um 
especially i guess in the 
late seventies and early eighties 
i was 
very active in um 
alternative  
fighting against nuclear power 
and um 
been active in various times in animal rights 
movements 
and uh 
political 
campaigns 
uh 
foreign policy kinds of debates 
that kind of 
kind of 
thing 
and 
one thing that i've noticed  a lot 
is 
there are a lot of 
there are well there 
wide spectrum but 
in the 
um 
there a lot of liberals 
in the catholic church too 
you know  
for example one of the 
that they were in the fore front on was 
uh  
justice for 
um 
people in central and latin america 
yeah 
uhhum 
arch bishop romaro 
yeah in el salvador 
that's 
uhhum 
uhhum 
that's right 
that's right 
yes 
so 
there 
are 
there are 
conservative and 
progressive wings for 
in every religion i'm sure 
even 
probably unitarian universalist 
although 
um 
i've heard that they conservative 
unitarian churches are in new england around boston 
where it was started and there are some that are relatively 
conservative there 
but um 
for the most part it's 
it's what you would call liberal religion 
yeah 
are ya 
great 
where you from 
oh okay 
okay 
uhhum 
uhhum 
my brother my older brother lived in bloomington for a while 
and 
he ran a 
music store 
on the  
square in the center of town 
might have just been called 
music i'm not sure 
sold guitars and 
square right across from the court house  
yeah 
i think it was the east side 
i think 
it's 
um 
it was while ago  hasn't been there for a while 
yeah 
uhhuh 
right 
right it probably went out of business when he left 

uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhuh 
uhhum 
uhhum 
right 
uhhuh 
uhhuh 
what instrument do you play 
uhhum 
uhhum 
play the french horn 
i don't think i said that before 
and 
i sing 
tenor 
and 
mostly 
choir stuff but 
i've done a 
few 
small solo 
things 
uh hum 
well 
what everybody when i tell 
i play 
that's what everybody says but 
it seems to me that any instrument 
depending i mean i can't see how anybody can 
play a clarinet for example 
but 
there 
some things that are hard about 
playing the 
french horn 
one is that you can play 
many different notes with a single 
fingering 
and 
you just 
it's 
ear related 
being able to 
play is 
related to how well 
how well you can hear 
and 
how well you can project 
what 
what you want to hear into 
how you form your mouth and 
what comes out 
right right it's not an analytical process 
it's analytical in the 
sense of 
controlling your mouth 
and 
and 
your hand in the bell and that kind of thing 
to 
get what you want to come out 
but 
it's not  analytical in terms of finger combinations no 
not so much 
right 
it's bad 
on the other hand it's not good to 
let your mind wander off 
find myself having to focus sometimes 
and to really 
uhhum 
yeah when i 
first went to oberlin i was a 
performance major 
in french horn 
and looking back on it i wish i'd 
maybe 
thought to 
major in music education 
or at least have a little bit of 
background in that 
because 
i'm 
it would have given me a little more 
dimension in terms of my 
my 
teaching 
possibilities 
and 
although i'm 
certified to teach now in 
chemistry and 
uh earth science 
um 
it might be nice to have the option of teaching music also 
i could i could 
it might take me 
uh 
a year or two 
just for the 
courses that i need 
yeah it is it is 
and there's nothing to guarantee that i wouldn't have the same result 
which isn't to say that someday i won't get 
back into teaching 
but um 
i might 
uh 
well it's harder than 
i think in 
some ways than people think 
um 
i went to the teach ohio fair last year 
to look around 
and  
didn't see that much interest  
in uh 
chemistry or general science teachers 
um 
i think the market has 
is fluctuated back to a point where they don't need as many 
they're not clamoring for us 
uhhum 
uh 
uhhum 
yeah 
i just renewed my  certificate last year so i 
part of the reason i renewed my certificate was 
i did some home instruction with the columbus public schools last year 
and 
that's kind of like a tutoring job where you can go 
you can arrange  
with a student 
that 
is at home for some reason 
um 
i had one that 
just had a baby 
and um 
they 
it's an interesting job because they look for somebody that 
can cover 
the most technical i guess subject that the student is taking 
in my case it 
turned out to be 
chemistry in one 
i think 
chemistry once and i 
it was the 
algebra 
two 
another 
but 
they expected us to 
at least expected me 
uh to cover the other subjects too or at least to spend a little bit of time on them 
so there was english and there was history 
so really requires you to be well rounded 
and i 
i like kind of like  um 
i've taught 
in a couple of other places um 
community 
colleges 
the  college in newark 
i taught a chemistry class there 
and 
the  
community college 
which is 
in hillsboro but i taught at their  branch 
and i taught a 
an introduction to ecology class 
an introduction 
to 
uh 
introduction to the arts it was called 
and that was interesting it was 
those are 
it's kind of an underclass of teachers they don't pay 
you enough to do that 
they 
pay you 
um 
per 
student contact hour 
and 
in my chemistry class i was 
teaching i think 
a total of five or six contact hours a week 
and they were 
paying something like 
twenty one or 
twenty 
two dollars an hour 
yeah they don't pay you for any of that 
no 
no they didn't 
um 
didn't pay for grading or 
preparing your classes or 
or researching 
so 
right 
but but still even though 
it was real 
very much underpaid job i 
i liked it 
when i did it 
um 
i liked the introduction to the arts class because i had to 
develop my own curriculum for it 
they had a 
when they told me i 
i 
they would hire me to teach this class they gave me a book 
that was about this thick and it was only about 
and i looked at it i thought 
introduction to the arts to me means something a lot broader 
so 
i ended up coming up with a class that was 
it was an 
only nine weeks too it was only nine classes 
um 
so was 
about a 
two and a half or three hour class each week for nine weeks 
and uh 
i ended up coming up with a curriculum where for the first three weeks we talked about painting 
mostly 
uh 
visual art 
and for the second three weeks we talked about music 
and the 
uh 
development of music 
various aspects 
and for the last three weeks we talked about 
theater 
actually for the 
two of the last three weeks we talked about theater 
and for the last week we talked about musical theater and opera 
so 
for a lot of these kids you know from  it was an introduction 
to 
uh 
it was an introduction to 
a lot of 
they may 
might not have been exposed to 
yeah 
yeah i think 
mostly they did 
uh 
i was kind of surprised 
uh 
which 
class was this in i think this was in that introduction to the arts class 
i was kind of surprised 
that one of the students in 
class 
thought it was 
very hard 
i didn't think it was that hard at all but 
she 
wrote me some kind of nasty note 
at the last class or before the last class that she had a straight a average at this school 
before that my class and i was giving her a b and she was her average was going to be ruined and she hoped i felt guilty about it 
not really 
not really 
i mean i was grading on a pretty much of a 
too i mean 
i was trying really not to flunk anybody that was 
that was 
attempting to do the work 
uh i think i flunked one person that was 
really goofing off 
and uh 
but in terms of a curve i had as i had bs i had a few 
yeah 
so 
yep 
oh well 
yeah 
yeah 
it might be 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
right 
right 
and 
and it seems to me kind of a questionable thing to  tell a teacher 
i'm 
to get an a 
what's wrong with you 
what's wrong with you 

i mean to me you're supposed to earn your grade 
it's always been my feeling and 
and uh 
i try to be fair in the way i grade 
uh 
you know it's i try to be as objective as i can 
sometimes i 
because i think it's important that people learn how to write 
i would ask all my classes to write 
an essay or 
short 
short uh 
essay for for a test 
and um 
but the way that i would grade those would be 
pretty 
i 
you know i'd come up with a rubric and i 
say 
you you need to have 
you need to mention certain things 
i will give certain 
your 
things 
yeah 
i've i've never been a 
been a teacher where whose had to assign or grade 
writing 
yeah 
right 
right 
uhhum 
right 
right 
right 
well 
when i was teaching 
taking teacher 
classes here 
um 
and 
classroom teachers 
um 
they 
would always tell me 
you 
need to give a grade for class 
that was always too subjective for 
i 
i could not 
see myself 
doing that and 
and you know 
how am i going to tell who's 
you know trying to butter me up 
by 
raising their hand and 
and asking questions 
um 
i uh you know i could i just couldn't see doing 
and i was 
i had enough to worry about and think about 
when i was trying to teach in 
keep everything else straight 
and also mark down if people are participating uh that was tough 
i ended up not doing it 
uhhum 
subjective right 
right 
bump 
i know 
i know i know well it's good to have that i think it would be good to have that leeway 
but i'm not sure i would trust myself because 
there there were definitely times when i was teaching when i would have 
of an affinity towards certain students and less towards others 
and i wanted to be fair 
in terms of 
um 
not cutting down the ones 
i 
didn't like that much 
yeah 
yeah 
uhhum 
uhhum 
right 
right 
right 
right 
i think teaching band might be fun because 
i think you 
only ever got a satisfactory or unsatisfactory in band and it had mostly to do with whether you were there 
whether you 
were 
well behaved yeah and whether you're trying to play your instrument 
i i don't think we ever got a's b's and c's 
yeah 
uhhum 
right 
the competition 
you played saxophone in the band 
uhhum 
yeah 
do you have one now 
uhhuh 
oh that's good 
that's good 
well i can tell you some community bands that could use you 
yeah yeah 
well 
um 
the one 
that's 
um 
god 
shawn's in yeah 
uh huh 
um 
uh we don't have enough saxophones 
sure we could use you 
huh 
oh well 
we're having like three concerts the next month 
right right 
right 
right 
uhhum 
uhhum 
i i like playing that band 
mostly because 
the director is  
he's a his dad is teaches trumpet here at ohio state 
and he is uh 
he likes to challenge us 
uh 
and it's not so much in the summer in the summer 
we end up playing marches and 
stuff that 
popular favorites 
right 
right but during the rest of the year a lot of times 
really 
really um 
challenging and interesting band music 
and you don't always get the opportunity to do that 
in uh 
musical groups 
yeah 
sometimes they just sort of cater to the lowest common denominator of 
what they 
expect the audience to want to hear 
well 
i play actually in two orchestras 
and uh 
symphony 
and in the  orchestra 
which is an all 
amateur group 
but uh 
it's 
it's actually 
there were 
uh when i was 
i've been in that group for 
maybe seven or eight years now 
there have been times when i've been in 
group that have 
i have 
thought 
it had a really wretched sound 
because they don't have auditions they just take anybody that wants to play 
and if you take a 
string player that can't play in tune it can really wreck everything 
yeah 
but uh i think we've improved a lot uh we we gave a concert 
uh 
a couple weeks ago 
at a church in upper arlington 
and uh 
i thought it went pretty well 
one piece a little bit of mozart 
uh 
some concertos 
so 
that was fun 
yeah 
well 
it depends 
i think 
i'd like to do new stuff 
but sometimes i also like to do the old favorites 
um 
in the 
symphony 
um 
unfortunately they tend to have budget problems 
um 
because a lot of the people in that group are paid 
um 
uhhum 
i get 
i get 
paid it's kind of semi professional 
aspect thing where you 
get paid per service 
but um 
let's see 
so they have to uh balance the number of rehearsals they can pay people for 
with the amount of music that 
they want to do 
and uh 
this last year we played a 
movement of the shuman concert piece for four horns and orchestra 
and i was a little bit 
flabbergasted when i saw that on the schedule 
at the beginning of the year because 
it's 
really 
to play 
and i thought 
is he expecting 
us to play this the solos 
or is he expecting to bring in somebody 
well as it turned out he expected 
us to play the solos 
or 
didn't play the whole piece we only played one movement of it 
and um 
i thought it came out pretty well i have a 
recording of it 
for a while there i was worried that we didn't get a recording of it and i was 
really upset 
yeah 
just one concert 
i know 
i know that's why you have to get it recorded 
it would be nice to have more than one concert 
but uh 
they 
they just 
they're on a shoestring 
they really are 
they get most of their money i think by 
well 
if you count 
in kind contribution 
the 
uh otterbein college pays for our rehearsal space our performance space 
and 
uh 
salary the conductor 
uh 
so that's a 
huge an amount of 
money 
they put into it 
what we have to 
give 
in return is 
an opportunity for 
to play 
so uh sometimes we have  
college students play in the orchestra 
especially string players because they 
have a 
college orchestra 
uh but once in a while we will get wind players play in it 
also 
and um 
sometimes 
leads to a little bit of friction 
when 
they get to play something you wanted to play 
but 
most the time it's not it's not bad 
um 
so there's there's that it's an 
opportunity for 
the 
musicians in the college to play in an orchestra 
and 
and what else do they get out of it 
i don't know prestige a suppose 
yeah 
they 
don't get  i don't think they get federal funding i think they get a little bit from the ohio arts council 
and they 
they raise money from the businesses 
the community 
we charge for tickets 
for people to come and see us 
and sometimes it's 
sometimes we get a lot 
sometimes we don't get so many 
turns out the concerts we get the most 
the biggest audience for 
are the 
christmas concerts where we have children's 
because 
yes yeah 
right 
you can't get a 
there 
so it's a good money maker 
uh 
right well we they don't they don't they don't give them 
uh 
i don't know maybe they give each  one free ticket or something 
yeah 
yeah 
uhhum 
uhhum 
yeah 
but that those are those tend to be my least favorite concerts although 
our conductor tries hard to 
make it interesting for orchestra members 
by bringing in some 
music but it's 
that's 
interesting 
challenging or whatever for orchestra 
he's um 
we're lucky to have him he's  
who's a 
associate conductor for the uh 
columbus symphony 
uhhum 
uhhum 
he's 
he's very good 
i 
i'm glad that we have him as a conductor 
i was in the orchestra when we 
selected 
him 
we auditioned 
think five 
four or five conductors over the course of the year we had 
each one for a different concert 
and we 
up picking him 
yeah 
they weren't all they 
all columbus 
some of them sort of 
flew in 
visited 
for 
for the job 
is a 
bit of prestige 
um 
was 
won some competition a couple years ago about 
uh 
upcoming 
in the 
the u 
right 
that's true 
true 
uhhum 
right 
that's true 
sometimes we 
have trouble finding enough 
violists 
or something you know an instrument like that 
um 
but they 
they 
usually get enough to play a concert 
sometimes we 
have to bring in 
a couple of 
instrumentalists 
for the last few rehearsals 
uhhum 
so we sort of have 
stringers 
i guess you'd 
yeah 
we've actually been on w o s u also 
uh radio on music 
um 
our  last year 
yeah 
of beethoven's ninth 
got on music in mid-ohio 
yeah 
we used the 
college choir 
it is it 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
there 
there there 
some 
things 
ah 
opera 
i have a picture 
that in my head 
with the big 
the 
it's a neat 
acoustics really 
shocking 
uhhum 
oh my 
uhhum 
uhhum 
well 
speaking of acoustics 
i i don't know 
i'm 
you will have to tell me if i'm going off the subject 
or you know if you need to ask me something else 
um 
this is another interesting story 
my 
church 
choir 
is very important 
of the 
up there on  have you ever been to the church up there 
should 
visit sometime although 
you're only 
to be here for another month 
summer is not necessarily the best time to visit 
but um 
just to see the church 
might be fun 
um 
we 
about 
how many years ago seven or eight years ago decided to build 
a new 
worship center building 
and because we were really 
too 
too big 
for the 
sanctuary that we had 
and um 
so basically they decided to build a new building 
adjacent to 
the church 
tacked on 
and 
we 
they asked the choir 
for input 
as to what the sanctuary should be 
so 
had a tour 
uh 
the choir took a tour our choir director 
um 
arranged it 
to about six five or six churches in the columbus area 
to 
in them 
not 
for an audience but just to sing 
and to see which ones 
liked the 
of 
and uh 
that was 
interesting we sang 
in uh 
we sang in 
downtown 
which was 
this 
my one of my orchestras plays a lot 
and uh 
we sang in other different kinds of churches and said what we liked about them what we didn't 
maybe it had some feedback i think the 
acoustically very good 
it's 
much 
than 
old 
worship center because 
i don't 
know if you've seen a picture or anything of the church 
the old worship center 
was designed by a modern architect to be a modern 
quote unquote type building in nineteen 
and 
it's 
it's 
flat 
a 
with a 
clear story 
in the middle 
it has 
in 
it's just empty 
over the 
over the worship center 
when you would sing in that as a choir you spread out along the front 
if you were under the 
high  
place 
your 
go 
all 
way to 
but if you were 
this flat 
ceiling that's only about 
seven or 
that's only about nine or ten feet high 
was 
it was 
and um 
it was 
you know we made do 
for many years 
and then um 
and then 
we had the 
the 
to get this input into this new 
and it's 
it's uh 
it's really beautiful it's a circular 
almost circular big 
uh 
space with a 
point in the 
of the roof 
and uh 
it's it's 
you could still go it's they won't have they won't 
a lot of um 
music 
during the summer but they will have 
regular worship service 
i think they're at ten 
on 
i 
lot of times skip 
during the summer 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
right 
right 
but how old is your 
you could 
but you could take her to 
oh okay 
well the reason i asked was a lot it 
to me a lot of 
impetus for going to 
or going back to church for people 
is when their kid gets old enough to 
go to sunday school 
starting 
questions about religion and you're saying 
well i suppose i could answer all of these but 
yeah 
right 
you go to 
right 
i started going to  sunday school when i was 
five or six years old 
i i was raised in the sunday school of this church up here 
yeah 
yes um a long time member 
in fact 
i think i may be 
about the longest term member of the 
right now yeah 
i sang in the 
there when i was in high school 
back in nineteen seventy 
that's thirty years ago 
yeah 
yep 
right 
right 
right 
it 
getting a little 
more common nowadays but 
it's still i 
the church gets most of its members from 
as converts 
recovering right 
recovering you name it 
yeah 
uhhum 
wow 
uh huh 
uhhum 
well i have 
i have two 
that are southern baptist ministers 
and it used to be when we would visit them 
in the mid sixties 
we would 
have to go i mean if you visit your 
relative if your relatives 
you're 
minister 
you 
go to 
and uh 
but the thing is is southern baptist 
um 
service always 
has that 
period 
where you're 

uh 
to come down and be 
so it made 
squirm a little bit always in my 
happened i was 
like 
i know who he's talking to 
my mother's two sisters 
married southern baptists ministers 
they always they have to go 
i guess it's 
a 
church 
it's 
more ruled by 
the  
it's like a not a diocese but it's more ruled by the convention 
the 
you where to go 
to preach 
and they were always in places like 
washington state and louisiana and tennessee and idaho and 
and 
just 
every where 
but it made 
to visit them 
long car trips 
one 
is in 
um 
see 
oregon 
near the coast 
forget the name the town 
not far  
it's along 
uh i think it's along the 
in oregon 
uh 
near 
eugene or 
like that 
and um 
the 
is in 
like 
which is where my mom's family came from they came from 
yeah 
my background is interesting my 
mother was born in louisiana 
and uh 
my father was born in new rochelle new york 
as the son of 
immigrant jewish 
from 
it is 
and it was 
world war two 
brought them 
um 
my 
my dad 
was uh 
in 
at 
end of the war he was in the army air corps he never had to go over seas 
that he was 
and louisiana 
and um 
where my mom 
a young high school student 
just graduating from 
and so 
they 
together there 
moved to 
um 
aerospace industry 
my dad 
uh 
had a degree in 
um 
engineering 
uh 
uh 
what kind of engineering 
drafting 
engineering 
i think 
and um 
worked for 
in 
california 
and they 
asked him to move 
the north 
plant 
in columbus 
out near the 
when it was north american before it became rockwell 
and um 
that's why we moved here 
and that's why i grew up on the east side  it was close to there 
and um 
and 
i was one year old we took 
car trip across the 
i don't 
much of 
that's how we moved 
well not just one my older brother would have been 
two and a half or three 
but at least we 
the stuff 
to look 
us interested 
and 
and 
a lot of 
i've always 
to travel by 
yeah 
it's fun 
and it's 
because of that early conditioning 
i've been i've been in 
forty eight states 
never in alaska or hawaii but 
for all 
yeah 
all forty 
lower 
that's right 
been 
do you know 
a group called 
um midnight 
oil 
yeah 
they're pretty good i like them yeah 
uh huh 
uh 
i 
learned about them from 
somebody i was working with who liked them 
listened to a lot of 
loaned me 
i taped it and 
their 
street 
i don't know if you've ever seen that it's fun 
it was fun 
they 
they  just set up uh 
on a flat bed truck on 
in new york 
and do a 
there 
uh huh 
uh huh 
it was 
yeah 
so i 
like 
pretty much all kinds of music 
yeah 
dig sometimes to find 
the kind of music i really don't like that much 
and 
i like some country music 
my i guess my favorites are 
are classical 
and uh 
rock rock and roll 
i 
some of 
now 
i like 
oldies 
the seventies and 
and uh 
i guess what's hard for me to listen to 
is 
i guess i don't know it used to 
w n c i 
where they 
part of the reason was i 
they just played the same songs over and over again 
yeah 
and the funny thing about that is 
if i heard one of those songs once 
i might not 
be that turned off 
it 
play it at me 
you know 
in three hours 
right 
right 
right 
right 
right 
right 
yeah 
yeah 
i don't know if you remember 
you might not be 
quite old enough but 
you may know the song 
sinead o'connor nothing compares to u 
when 
when 
um 
when that song came out 
you would 
probably hear it 
least twelve times a day on some of those radio stations 
and it got so i just 
cannot stand this i can't 
it 
uh huh 
huh 
well 
and you know 
itself 
if i 
heard it 
or 
eh 
yeah 
and she's an interesting character i guess i mean 
i don't know everything about her 
i remember that she insulted the pope 
yeah 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uh huh 
well let 
ah 
somebody else who's not that well known do you know 
john gorka 
have you heard of him 
he's really worth looking into  
he's funny he has good songs he's a folk singer really uh along the lines of uh 
maybe arlo guthry or somebody i mean  he does electric stuff 
but he also does acoustic 
and um he writes most of his own songs 
yeah 
and  if you ever see something by him you should 
it 
or 
if you see it in a friend's collection ask to listen to it 
he has 
of the 
are 
funny and some of them 
the 
you've 
uh let's see funny ones are 
examples of funny ones are winter cows 
let's see 
i can't think of 
too 
of them right now 
uh 
yeah 
yeah g o r k a 
i think he's originally from 
uhhuh 
i don't know where he 
uh 
i've seen him 
he's 
bands 
i remember mcguffey lane 
i don't know if you 
know who they are 
yeah 
they wrote a song probably their most famous one was called green grass and high times forever 
don't know if that was what it was called 

uh huh 
uh huh 
yeah 
they were all right 
um 
other columbus 
sally  
is from columbus 
i don't know if you know who she is 
um 
um hum 
go 
if you 
yeah it's only 
it's still 
seven 
yeah 
i like to talk about 
columbus 
in some ways i like it 
in 
some ways 
it's not 
my favorite place 
but 
it seems like it's 
relatively safe 
place to live 
although 
that's coming from me i've been robbed 
at gun point or knife point about  times i 
think 
columbus yeah 
maybe five 
um 
i drove a taxi cab 
for couple summers 
and i was robbed 
think twice 
driving the cab 
and 
part of it was 
just being stupid 
but 
it was down around mount vernon area 
and uh 
they got 
very little money 
but 
i 
and i was also robbed about 
times 
delivering pizzas for domino's 
in the  
area really 
uh 
a couple times were down 
a little bit south of campus fourth street and fifth avenue near there fourth street and 
seventh 
and but 
once was right 
practically on 
sixteenth 
at near high street 
i was robbed there 
yeah 
near the 
that united christian center 
that's right there on fifteenth avenue 
they always have a way to get you out of the   
you know 
they will order pizza for 
someplace that's dark 
they will be waiting there for 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
i have experience in that and i 
i'm 
thankful that it was always 
a 
sort of thing 
although 
what's going on 
your 
and your body isn't that 
yeah 
you know 
that's possibility 
don't 
you you're not supposed to carry that much 
money around 
and it's  as much to protect the people after you 
as it 
protect 
you 
because 
the  the word 
to get out that 
we don't have 
money 
it 
yeah 
thing  
go head 
i one thing 
i was thinking 
you know that i have a perspective on 
that maybe 
lots 
lots of people don't is how columbus has grown up 
yeah 
and 
just a 
couple things i remember when i 
first started going 
the unitarian church 
up here on 
um 
well when i was  
in  
sunday school 
we 
we drove there from reynoldsburg 
by going 
think 
reynoldsburg new 
up to 
uh morse road and then over on morse road to high street 
so it was 
was on the back 
you know 
and that was before the mid 
when the freeway 
i seventy was 
through 
and 
a lot of  
lot of 
you don't 
of havoc that 
when a freeway is built 
through the middle of a town 
because 
you to take out 
houses 
do 
and  
you can sort of realize it if you ever 
around the area 
and go 
one of the little side 
that dead ends because the freeway is there 
and see the side street 
on the 
side 
and you think about 
there must have been twenty or 
houses 
had take 
here 
to put 
uhhum 
right 
right 
right 
so 
that 
that was an 
went 
to 
up 
hamilton and over to 
and on morse or up 
new albany 
road to 
morse  over to 
street 
of that 
was out there on morse 
road i don't know if you know morse road very well but there's 
out 
out 
out by karl 
shopping center after shopping center 
after shopping center 
after housing 
after 
but 
we 
this 
the mid  
when we drove up that way in the early sixties 
there was 
there were fields there were farms 
there were 
there were 
you know none of that 
out 
and it's just 
it's just 
amazing the urban sprawl has taken 
out there 
some ways  
it i guess it's necessary but it's just 
you reminisce about 
the 
way it use to look and 
and um 
i was just at a place 
last night 
i was at this 
a 
meeting 
for the 
national wildlife 
they're planning for 
madison county 
and um 
there were 
some 
there was some talk about 
that and 
it seemed to me 
there were people that were in favor of the refuge 
there people that were opposed to the wildlife refuge 
mostly 
people that lived there 
near there 
farmers and 
and 
but it seems like the one thing that 
almost 
there agreed on was 
didn't wanna see the place go to 
be over run by 
condos and housing developments 
and um 
that 
we 
somebody was 
about 
the difference between development 
here in the united states and in 
um 
and how 
development in 
in europe tends to 
take 
note of the fact that space is not 
so you will have more 
uh 
more people living  one 
or one apartment 
uh 
and they will go 
up 
rather 
just 
up space 
you know they they're 
about preserving 
space and preserving wild space 
mhm 
that's the 
this country is that there's 
space in the 
states 
and 
north america 
that 
you 
have all these incredible 
and still 
find 
wild 
between them 
yeah 
it's not  
not monroe 
monroe's 
is it 
okay 
okay 
yeah 
uhhum 
yeah 
crummy new crummy new apartment buildings 
you know 
constructed 
yes 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
there's no  
no 
there's no concept behind 
you're right 
to 
the 
area commissions are 
to  
work on that and 
unify 
i 
used to be on the university 
commission 
and 
in the 
campus area 
of 
worked on although we 
some of the 
other commissions in columbus are 
almost strictly 
they  only talk about the 
of 
buildings people can build 
and the university area commission we dealt with that 
we dealt with  whether something would be commercial 
residence 
we dealt with 
yeah 
a lot 
yeah 
uhhum 
well i got 
can tell 
but i think 
hour is 
up sorry 
well it's not 
it's not that i wouldn't keep 
talking but you probably sort of have a limited 
yeah 
uhhum 
right right yeah huh 
that's 
uhhum 
that's good 

forty nine 
uhhum 
i've been here since seventy two actually 
uhhum 
i'm actually from athens 
i was in the service there for about six years so 
mine was southeastern ohio 
o u 
uhhum 
just kind of moved here a little bit 
all right 
a uh 
uh i got out of the service my parents were uh older and the um 
kind of felt an obligation to 
be around them to help take care of them and stuff 
uhhum 
uh  
we actually were from columbus we moved down to 
athens and then uh 
they moved back up here when i was in the service 
airforce 
uhhum 
mm 
i was in sixty nine to seventy two so um then i was in two years reserves uh 
uh  
basically uh electronic engineering not not an engineer but electronic assembly and stuff like that and this was systems analyst was what it was called but 
they've got these big names for things 
uhhum 
uhhum 
yeah i graduated from athens high school uh 
enroled in uh 
o u for uh 
the winter quarter and 
proceeded to party that out and 
and at the time 
we uh  there were had drafts 
draft notices at the time so i 
got a draft notice and 
enlisted 
uhhum 
uh i kind of uh i i was like a rebel you know i didn't really uh 
it wasn't really my cup of tea actually i had a pretty decent job i worked four and a half days a week uh 
basically in the uh 
electro uh mechanical type of things you know remove and replace what they do a lot now with cars and um 
they put a thing on a machine and 
that says take that out you know and try it you know and you put that in and 
so was there it  it 
in hindsight you know it was 
was cool 
but 
but i had i liked the long hair it was uh 
back in the sixties so you know 
uhhum 
yeah 
i was only nineteen 
well i was eighteen when i went in but 
uhhum 
well i've  i've 
been married and uh divorced and uh i got an eighteen year old daughter uh they live in saint louis 
um 
i worked at ashland chemical for about thirteen years uh in the administrative management and 
kind of went through some bad times there and everything so uh 
kind of 
i 
i like calling it working for myself uh because i worked through a  
temporary agency you know i work when i want to and do what i want to do and 
but it gets kind of old too you know when you 
like two   
all this week i haven't been able to get out 
you know so 
uhhum 
uhhum 
we were married eleven years so 
uhhum 
we got divorced in eighty eight 
she's doing all right as far as i know she's going to 
saint louis university 
don't ask me why but 
well i wanted her to go to missouri or uh 
or come here but 
she says only reason you want me to come there is because you get football tickets i think 
well 
no i wanted to see her obviously but 
that was a part of the reason but 
uhhum 
uh 
not as much as i used to be when i was younger 
we used to be diehard but 
not any more you know 
uhhum 
yeah by their standards but they still were six and six you know and 
they  probably 
could have won maybe a couple more games but that's about it you know really 
no   
just a player you know i mean they lost uh four or five different uh 
top notch players that went to the pros and 
most of them are starting or 
you know so 
uh 
old cooper's thing is we don't rebuild we reload you know well 
sometimes it takes couple years to reload you know 
but i've never been an  fan of cooper either so 
they  
just 
says some stupid things sometimes 
i was listening to uh 
or not corby uh some show on w t v and i listen to them talk shows and everything and uh 
he supposedly has said something to uh 
he had got rid of two assistant c a h s so he  supposedly said something to one assistant c a h s id that you know 
i'd like to hire you and everything but you're not the right color 
you know i mean that's 
not something that you 
would think a head coach at ohio state would say you know 
uhhum 
but you know 
when he first came here he said that 
you couldn't win here because he had too many slow white guys so 
and that was pretty dumb but 
uhhum 
well  
i'm surprised myself you know 
they wouldn't say who the guy was that interviewed but i don't think that probably be that hard to figure out you know they're 
uh 
uhhum 
uhhum 
yeah 
they you you love to hate him or love him one the other i  i think he's a great coach uh 
i think he does some stupid things but we all do you know 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uh he he uh 
was a  
a  a 
great advocate of uh of old woody you know so 
he probably learnt quite a bit from the old general you know 
uhhum 
yeah 
uhhum 
well he had a thing i  
i read a book about him a season on the brink where he 
he had a bad 
couple years there and everything you know and 
and he'd bring the  
guys in you know and sit there and say now if you want be a pansy 
there down there's where the football team is you know 
i want you to be a man you know 
play basketball 
uhhum 
uhhum 
i got a friend of mine that graduated from uh 
purdue university of indiana or something like that 
i think that's what it was 
i said p u 
p u university huh 
uhhum 
yeah and they just beat indiana in basketball 
saturday i think it was 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
yeah 
well they had a heck of a time beating cincinnati 
which they probably should've killed 
and then o u had a heck of a time beating them you know 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
yeah and that's the where you 
that's way you really you should be i mean uh 
you got to be ready for tournament time you know 
i don't know if this thing moved or what 
yeah  uh 
i like baseball 
i used to like that a lot better when i was younger but 
now i don't i wouldn't take the time to  
sit and watch a whole baseball game on the tv you know 
the reds and indians 
uhhum 
the reds uh 
more so than the indians back 
my younger days because they weren't worth a damn but 
uhhum 
uhhum 
i 
not really a 
big fan uh 
i think one of the big problems is gonna be uh 
uh initially just the uh 
uh the monetary thing of it you know the people that supported the uh 
basically supported the uh 
uh minor league teams that they had here you know uh were like blue collar people and that 
you go for twenty thirty bucks and 
have a good time get drunk throw beer and 
and up there you know you're not gonna be able to do that it's gonna cost you uh 
a minimum of fifty to a hundred dollars probably take a family there 
couple of kids or something like that you know 
well the minor league hockey team the columbus chill are never there 
uhhum 
they don't have it now but uh because the blue jackets came in but 
but 
i think it'd be good if it goes but 
i'm just not sure that 
columbus is gonna support something like that 
and it's basically ohio state you know 
and they don't even support the uh 
hockey team we got  ohio state you know 
and yet they're good 
uhhum 
uhhum 
well the uh wolff family and uh 
the mcconnells have been around forever you know 
uh worthington industries and 
and the wolff family's columbus dispatch uh 
uh then you got uh i think it's rozutti 
uh he's like a 
was a construction guy so uh 
uh 
they've been around forever and everything and uh 
they 
can get their ways through uh 
political arenas and everything  but i think most the money was uh 
was private money 
but they were given like tax incentives and 
things of that nature 
the old  
uhhum 
yeah it's an  it was an old eyesore that they should have got rid of years ago but 
uhhum 
well i think they tried to get some kind of a deal with uh 
when they were planning this thing and with uh 
with ohio state to 
uh 
you know like have the schottenstein center down at uh 
down closer to downtown or 
or something like that 
and play half your ball games there or something like that but 
but ohio state don't need that you know they got their own stuff 
so 
uhhum 
uhhum 
yeah 
well that basically is  you know 
as your 
influx of 
people move outer 
city limits and everything you know then uh 
you know you got to have places for them to shop and everything and 
basically the northland mall's been there forever jacob who owned indians 
owned it 
uh 
and he never did anything to it you know so 
you got  over at your lazarus or penney's and 
uh 
mainstay 
places that 
generally move there because of the uh 
years ago because it was 
something well it was right there with  with a lot of people population and everything 
and then  
like i say if you you know you got 
basically the people moving 
out 
to get away from the 
the traffic and all that stuff you know 
not that they're moving away from it they're still getting into it but 
uh the district perspective on it 
uh 
then you 
if you build it they will come they say you know so 
uhhum 
uhhum 
and i guess he's still gonna build it so 
uhuh 
as it was jacob's sold the northland mall anyway so it's probably gonna be 
like a 
a strip mall more or less 
uhhum 
yeah 
which is good for me because i don't ever go there anyway so 
and i'm one of those go in get what you want and get the heck out you know and 
uhhum 
i remember when i was married my my ex said do you want go uh 
shopping 
what 
just get me a couple shirts or something you know she always bought my clothes anyway so 
so just get me a couple  get me whatever you think i need you know 
i will be here 
drinking beer watching 
sports 
you know 
it's uh 
i live at um one sixty one and cleveland area 
in an apartment up there 
it ain't that far it's uh 
if you got a car it's easy to get there 
yeah but 
if you if you're 
ride the bus it's sometimes uh 
takes a couple hours so 
uhhum 
uhhum 
yeah 
i'd like to seen it pass just for the fact to see what the hell they would have done with the money but 
uh 
i don't blame people for voting for the one and not vote for the other 
because you're talking about something twenty years 
i had a engineering 
a civil engineering friend years ago and uh 
i was a 
worked at ashland chemical which is over in dublin and i lived over where i'm living now 
and every 
year they were doing work on two seventy you know 
so i get pissed off and uh bitch 
be bitching at him about it and everything you know and he'd go 
you don't realize you know by time we get something approved 
through all the 
parameters you've got to go through and everything 
and then they start working on it and then they get it done 
it's already ten fifteen years old 
guess i never thought about it 
like that 
uhhum 
uhhum 
yeah 
uhhum 
yeah  that's 
i'm surprised they're not getting a lot of heat from that but 
because that park's been there forever you know 
uhhum 
uhhum 
yeah 
plus they have that uh 
which they've had for like twenty some years a comfest or something 
uh which is 
big thing down there you know 
uh 
local musicians and 
uhhum 
uhhum 
yeah but the ones that they really needed to do 
like two  well like seventy one and seventy i mean that 
i don't 
it's a bottle neck area you know 
and they really should have done something with that 
twenty years ago you know 
um that's probably when they started yeah 
uhhum 
i used to when i was driving now uh 
especially when i was going through the uh 
going to two seventy things you know i had people flip me off and stuff like that and 
i had a funny thing one time a guy flipped me off because he was going slow 
and uh 
i got all 
pissed off about him and went around him and everything you know and 
i go to  
work 
pull in at ashland chemical and who pulls in beside me but him 
i look over at him he looks at me like 
oh 
you know i'm sorry i mean you know i was 
uhhum 
no we just 
both happen to work there 
uhhum 
it's over off of uh 
thirty three 
two seventy and thirty three 

uh 
i was going through a divorce parents 
both parents passed away uh 
my ex moved to saint louis didn't 
tell me anything about it or foreclosing on the house and that's how i found out she moved and 
just a bunch of 
shit and 
i just started uh 
screwing up 
so they wanted to 
put me on probation and my uh 
rebellious attitude or whatever said 
i quit 
was pretty stupid really but 
uhhum 
you know what happened like in the same 
year eighty eight 
you know so 
but it was 
it was 
pretty tough but i just didn't deal with it properly you know 
i should've went and got counseling and by the way i probably should've got 
marriage counseling but i refused to do that too so 
but i didn't think i had a problem i thought she was the one with one 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
but she's doing fine 
um 
she was dating somebody i don't know whether they really got married or not you know because i don't really have that much communication with her but 
some guy younger than her and 
i talked to him he seemed like pretty decent guy 
yeah 
well it was rough 
not the actually going through it you know 
to me 
it was to her 
but the aftermath basically you know you  
at each other's throat for this that and the other and 
and 
you know devon is uh my daughter's the one that really got 
put in the middle of it you know and 
probably it was a blessing that they moved to saint louis because there probably could have been more uh 
problems 
legal problems you know as far as uh 
going back and forth to court and 
putting her on the witness stand for stupid stuff you know and 
so 
uh 
in hindsight it was kind of a blessing that they moved there 
no i've never i've i used to uh 
have an office out there that i visited all the time but uh 
i've never been out there to 
she actually lives in kirkwood 
which is a suburb 
uhhum 
so uh 
that's where she went to high school and everything uh 
but i had no i've never went out there 
uh my my ex still has family here so 
she comes back a couple three times a year and 
i generally try to hook up with her 
and 
it's been a while but as she got older you know she wants to be with 
with her uh 
playmates and everything as they get older you know so 
and 
having went through that myself i understand that so 
no it got kind of rough to have her here for a couple 
three weeks out of a 
or a month or something like that you know during the summer 
uhhum 
or they don't really give a damn that's the thing that uh 
i've got i've got some friends that 
with kids and 
i see it like on the bus or with uh you know when you're working somewhere and uh where you 
people treat there kids you know as a 
i mean i didn't have the greatest childhood i don't think any of us ever really had the best you know but 
but i don't 
like i wouldn't 
talk to my kid the way 
some of these people talk to them 
but um 
one today you know and she got on the bus and 
the little girl went and set over here she's probably about 
eight 
maybe six or something like that and she wanted to set here her mommy so she made her set with her which is cool 
and mommy just goes to sleep and the little kid's trying to study her homework you know for 
not that well 
i don't know was she up all night partying or was she up all night working you know or 
what the hell's is your problem 
uhhum 
but the little girl's setting there going 
mommy you need to go 
help with seven like seven nine times nine's sixty three you know and 
her time tables and stuff you know and 
so uh 
yeah i see 
like younger kids to 
with kids you know and 
and think you know man your just 
not only have you wasted  
you screwed up your life you're gonna 
you also screwed up your kids you know 
i was twenty 
well i was thirty one when devon was born so 
my ex was twenty eight 
so we were 
both older 
not that that really helped as far as 
but i think it gave her  
and i wouldn't say i never got mad uh but 
i've gotten mad at devon quite a few times you know because i didn't like to 
some of the things that uh 
she would either say or 
or that she would do or 
uh 
but 
you know 
i try to let her 
live her life you know 
i think there's love 
nobody can 
teach anything unless you learn it 
uhhum 
uhhum 
yeah she went to school here till uh 
ninety one actually 
uh 
so she was 
let's see 
about the fourth grade 
fifth grade something like that 
uhhum 
yeah 
mm 
i think it could have  i thought she'd get a better education out there 
uh 
now at saint louis school public school district she probably 
district she probably would've  had the same as here 
but by being kirkwood you know and 
relatively small and everything 
um 
i think we maybe had uh 
a hundred and 
some kids in our graduating class you know so 
uh i felt i got better 
attention when i wanted it 
you know 
uh 
then i would've at a 
at a bigger school 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
yeah much too fast for me you know 
my 
i know the way we you know the way we dressed and everything you know it was kind of appalling to 
to the parents and everything i guess maybe that's where 
i'm coming from i mean uh 
the way some of the uh 
kids dress 
you know retro back to when with the bell bottoms and everything to us 
and the uh 
the piercings i just can't get into that you know and 
then some of the girls i mean they you know 
i mean my god they 
at 
fourteen six fifteen years old they look like they're twenty some years old you know and that's what they want to look like 
plus you watch some of these stupid shows on tv you know 
you 
sit there and go 
man i couldn't   my daughter don't do that you know it's 
when she's around me 
never 
when she's away from me i don't know what the hell she does 
well i think uh 
in my opinion i think  mainly the uh 
its the absence 
of uh 
basically 
parenting you know 
uh 
my mom was there 
um 
she was a housewife you know 
and uh 
so she was 
she went to work after  
i think when i was a 
junior in high school you know 
and my brother they all my brothers and sisters are graduated you know so 
uhhum 
and that hurt her to go she 
thought she was letting 
you know neglecting me i was in 
uhhum 
thought about it i've 
come home get in the car and go out go somewhere you know or come home get something to eat and 
yeah that was about it i 
ah but 
i think that has a lot to do with it um 
i don't really  
know that tv has that much because i remember coming home as a kid and watching 
howdy doody and all that stuff and 
course it wasn't the uh 
violent stuff maybe that you can see on tv now or uh but 
i don't really think the media just hasn't had that much to do with it 
it's just a different time now uh 
i mean i remember 
uh 
one of the things i saw when i was a kid on a newscast you know with uh 
uh  
the vietnamese guy uh 
vietcong guy getting 
his brains blowed out on national tv you know and uh 
uh 
that didn't make me go out and 
um want to do that you know 
so 
if anything it made me want not want to do it you know because 
my brother was in was in vietnam 
he was in the army 
and uh when i got my notice he's like three years older than me you know and he's 
so i mean it don't 
they will draft you they will put you on the front line 
i said well i'm going to 
enlist in the airforce anyway 
so 

as long as you uh 
see and i'd already i already  
knew i was gonna be getting a notice so 
because i flunked out like in december 
you know 
and uh 
so in january i had already contacted the navy and the airforce 
uh 
about getting into their taking their tests and everything taking their uh 
physicals 
uh 
so 
uhhum 
right 
uhhum 
well then they had uh after that they had the lottery number and that wasn't 
if you were hot you know if you got 
your number was picked i mean 
i don't know which would be worse knowing that you're gonna get 
a notice and 
being able to prepare for it or 
uh because i've had friends that got  uh numbers and everything you know and and getting a high number and sitting there going oh my god 
so 
uhhum 
uhhuh 
i was reading a thing though in uh 
the u s a i think it was yesterday where uh 
your uh 
minority and your your uh 
uh majority you know uh 
it's always been that well you know they were 
trying to make it seem like it's 
different it's always but like you know 
like the army has always been forty percent 
uh minority and 
sixty percent or something like that you know that uh 
airforce has always been 
uh 
like 
seventy thirty or something like that you know because the standards are a little bit higher to get in and a lot of people don't want to get into that you know they don't want to take them tests and everything you know 
uh my 
uh 
a cousin that 
was a uh 
spent 
twenty five years i think in the army because that's 
he could have done better but that's all he wanted to 
you know 
be a drill sergeant and stuff like that you know 
but uh 
i just think a lot  lot of times the media 
uh 
and research and stuff like that to do a lot of things that were 
done 
years ago 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
they always been there i mean you know and uh i don't really care what the uh 
guys 
specific thing is if he's in a fox hole with me you know and 
as long as he can shoot a 
you know i mean 
i could care  i've got gay friends you know so 
i think it's better probably at the 
don't let them say anything about it you know 
and most of the people will 
you know like when you get to a 
i lived in the barracks a lot of time but i mean 
you know 
lot of people you know they get their own places off base you know and 
who cares what they are i mean i don't care 
you know 
like say i have  gay friends that 
you know and 
i don't care what they do i mean if 
old enough to do whatever the heck 
they want to do you know 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
yeah i 
well i think basically that goes back to uh 
you know the parenting and everything you know there was something 
missing in the uh 
uh the child's life you know uh 
uh i bet he wasn't getting 
perhaps 
attention 
uh those 
kids in particular i don't 
understand how they could be building bombs in 
in their basement and mom and dad not know what was going on you know i mean 
uh it's just tragedy 
i had a friend when i was a kid too that uh 
uh 
we were like 
i don't know uh 
eleven years old or something like that well an accidental shooting him in 
him and the 
uh another friend of mine from the same 
same class you know 
um 
he pulled a gun and shot him you know and didn't know that the damn thing was loaded but 
and they were talking about another thing about that you know where some 
kid i guess that happened just here in town uh 
couple about a week ago or something like that you know where a guy 
shot another guy but 
i mean 
those things are just 
senseless crimes really you know 
and who's really to fault and who's really at  
who's guilty i don't know 
uh 
i'd like to have uh 
not that they'd ever would have but if if 
one of the two that you that   you know if they would have survived i'd like to seen what was going through their heads you know 
but that's something we will never know 
uhhum 
uhhum 
but that's kind of it 
it 
you know kind of came through where they were like uh 
when i was growing up we had the uh 
the 
you know you had your jocks and everything of course and you had your uh 
we were called deads you know 
uh 
and i was kind of like in the middle you know of it 
i played a little bit of sport you know but i also associated with them and they were basically potheads you know and everything so 
uh 
so like i say i  
you know 
i was kind of uh associated with both of them but then the football players you know 
some of them were uh 
pretty uh 
pretty much asses you know 
no other way to put it especially if they were 
got scholarships and stuff you know they were 
mean they could be real 
uh 
nasty 
but uh 
i just can't  i don't know i just think maybe 
i don't know looking at it back is like uh well i've got into arguments with a few of and then seen them later on you know and 
it's like 
hey man you know 
let me buy you beer you know or whatever you know 
sorry about what happened we were 
you know 
shoot it happened five years ago you know i don't 
i try to forget things that 
you know i mean 
my mind 
got enough to absorb you know without 
worrying about uh which i do worry quite a bit about things but 
uh 
about stupid stuff uh 
like that kind of you know somebody gets mad at you because you were a 
your a not a jock or you know you're you're a you're a 
you're a this or you're a that you know everybody trying to label people and stuff 
yeah and  and everybody's gonna associate with people that they feel comfortable with 
so 
you know 
and unfortunately as that guy this guy in particular he was a center for the football team as he grew up 
older you know uh 
he realized that he wasn't as big as important as he uh 
and he blew out his knee for a 
o u you know 
i went to 
i went to school with larry hunter who's the a 
basketball coach for uh 
o u 
now 
and uh 
and he had the same thing happen to him uh he had uh scholarship for o u and 
both of his knees are shot and everything but uh 
and he was a good ballplayer probably one best ones i ever seen and 
uh 
rivalled like a larry byrd you know back in that day and everything and uh 
but 
one heck of a nice guy you know 
never let it get to him 
never thought he was any better than anybody else you know he was always there to 
to help out every kid you know 
but then some people like you say you know some people aren't that way 
uhhum 
uhhum 
they had one i was uh just 
heard on news this morning they were talking about some guy who's like seventy seven years old for 
kenyon college or something the 
was throwing erasers at  
yeah 
but i could 
i could imagine 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
yeah but you know the  if you hit somebody in the eye obviously it's gonna hurt him but you know most 
could see it they 
they could be ducking i mean you know you 
seventy seven years old i can't imagine being hurt by him you know 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhuh 
uhuh 

i've 
i 
at  at one time i kind of wanted to be a teacher and everything but 
course that would have been i'm forty nine so that would have been 
probably what about 
twenty 
four 
so 
would have about twenty five years in so 
i'd be right at and ready to get the heck out anyway you know 
uhhum 
uhhum 
plus you get so many different 
students and 
what i like 
just walking over here today you know it's 
kind of thought you know 
i wonder how many of these people i walk by you know are gonna be here in 
january 
because you know a lot of because i did you know i thought well this is cool man you know 
uhhum 
uhhuh 
yeah 
should been in class 
uhhum 
uhhum 
well and and and especially in my situation you know at the 
i think about it quite a bit you know if i would've had a 
more of an opportunity to have a one on one 
uh 
relationship with her i'd probably uh 
uh being a girl 
you know could of probably helped her out in the 
in a lot of  
social things social things you know about 
man because i 
i 
kind of get the impression that she don't really that she still ain't very interested in 
men you know so 
much as 
it's her thing you know 
so 
uhhum 
so um 
but you know i 
uh 
yeah i think you know a lot of times you think well you know um 
when you don't even know you sit there say i'm only a phone call away you know 
and all you do is call me but 
it's not the same thing as 
being there and 
and she's 
well i remember one time when she was having a stomach ache she was like 
uh like twelve or thirteen years old you know and 
and i said well what's the matter she goes uh 
my stomach hurts i said uh 
well are you on you on your period or what you know and she goes 
dad 
i said what you know she goes uh 
well i don't talk i won't talk to you about stuff like that i said 
why 
i'm you're dad you know for godsake she goes 
well that's something that 
might talk to mom about but i wouldn't talk to you about it and i said well that's cool but 
you know 
just wanted to let you know that i do know women go through that stuff you know 
so 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum uhhum 
that uh 
it 
it was 
like i say i said 
she probably 
probably thinks the same way you know she'd been here you know and having trouble with boys and everything you know when she was growing up but not probably would have 
could have probably 
would have been an ass about that kind of stuff you'd think i'm not 
how bad they were you know if they laid a hand on her 
of course you know but 
but uh 
um 
but by her being away you know then 
and her mom's got a cool head on her shoulders she wouldn't let that happen 
unless she told me about it then she'd be probably be afraid tell me that 
i'd catch an airplane flight  over there or something you know 
fuck the guy up or something 
so that uh you know and 
she would have been going to northland high school which is up here just awhile up where i'm living at one sixty one cleveland area 
then uh 
so 
it would have been interesting 
you know 
to 
but then you know that then the other side of it you know the 
the 
they think 
women tend to have the  
more emotional 
type of feelings than uh then men you know we carry it on our shoulders you know 
so uh 
yeah i just 
hope she 
adjusts 
uhhum 
uhuh enjoy them now 
you got the terrible twos to go through which is 
which is cool 
and uh 
i remember one time when we got in a big argument one time when she uh 
when she turned teen 
teenager 
and uh 
i called her up and she was on the phone with somebody else and i sat there and said well you know i'm calling long distance she goes 
so i'm talking to my girlfriend i said 
so what hang up on her and call her back 
you don't tell me what to do 
i said 
said 
well okay 
you want to call me back 
well bye 
feel like it or something like that 
i think she called me ended up calling me back couple three hours later 
and i was pissed so i wouldn't talk to her you know 
little childish things that you know 
well i will pay you back you know 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
i don't know another thing about the kids nowadays is that it's uh and and devon 
i experienced it with her you know so 
i sent her a hundred dollars one time you know just for her and she sat there and said uh i called her up couple days later well about a week  a  
a week later something like that and uh 
said what did you do with that uh what'd you get with that money and everything she goes well you know i bought a gap tee shirt and i uh 
cd and i said 
uhhum 
she goes uh 
what do you mean uh huh that's what i bought and i said 
you bought a cd and 
a blouse 
she goes well yeah dad they cost money i said 
oh lord 
uhhum 
well then i think she probably took her girlfriends out to the mall you know and 
partied a little bit with her mcdonald's and everything 
that's one thing i see about kids doing nowadays a lot too is uh 
socializing like that 
shopping malls and 
and 
things of that nature 
uhhum 
uhhuh 
uh 
i remember  uh you know we'd like go to a pool hall or something you know bar that actually you know and they'd be a but we'd play pool you know they wouldn't let us drink or nothing because we were underage but uh 
that was basically the guys you know 
and the girls would go 
over to somebody's house you know and 
then we'd meet up later on you know and go our separate ways or 
we had drive ins back then you know we'd go to the 
a movie 
uhhum 
so uh 
as far as going shopping that wasn't really something that was that big of a thing 
that was maybe a saturday thing with mom and dad you know because they had the money you know  
uhhum 
uhhum 
yeah 
no  
uh no there was more uh 
just getting you know going out 
uh 
but 
you know what's what are you doing saturday night 
nothing 
you want to go out 
yeah 
alright we'd just go out you know 
then 
if you got kiss or something you know or 
god forbid you copped a feel you know mean you know 
but i mean that was  
different time you know so 
nowadays it's a lot different than that you know 
uhhum 
uhhum 
that's good 
uhuh 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uh yeah you slept you know it'd 
well you can see it here i mean you can 
uh 
see some nineteen year old or eighteen year old uh 
guy or girl or whatever you know and 
see the difference in the maturity you know of uh another couple three different 
people and everything uh 
i don't know whether 
me coming from like a rural 
area you know athens and everything uh 
and i think it maybe has something to do with that even true today you know you're more uh 
family oriented um 
um 
your  
you're friends are basically you know you count them on your hands which you still can but uh 
but you socialize a lot more if you're in the city 
with more people 
and everything 
where if you come from like a smaller town 
you tend to socialize with 
a certain 
people 
you know 
group or or whatever 
you know 

i haven't been back there for about ten 
ten years 
uhhum 
i'd like to move back down there but there just isn't any work you know so unless you own your own company so 
mm that basically is remodeling dry wall and 
stuff like that and 
that's the appalachia area yeah 
uhhum 
it'd be great if somebody you know they gonna want to pump all this money into it but unfortunately whenever the government pumps money into an area you know 
that 
tends to be like a uh 
foreign country gets it you know and 
well uh here 
yeah 
they gave us ten thousand 
here's a dollar 
have fun 
yeah it 
uh yeah they  they've got two different uh articles in there uh about it well they had a big article uh 
back when uh 
who was it 
jesse jackson was down there or something 
what a couple years ago or something 
and uh 
he made a concerted effort to 
try to let people know how  how 
poverty is down there and everything 
but then you go to a lot of other extremes you know where you set there and these people wouldn't 
want to live in columbus 
so 
you know 
you can give them a  a million dollar house up here and 
and an income for the rest of their life they don't want that they want to live down where they 
where they're 
feel comfortable at 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
i  uh  moved into  
uh up there one sixty one cleveland area 
uh but i lived up area for years but i just moved back up there 
and uh 
why i left it was because of the 
the city 
the traffic and everything where you get around campus you know it's a lot 
and they sell hustle hustle hustle 
but down here 
even with 
with the kids and everything going 
to school but basically it's 
kind of laid back 
uh 
where up there it's all 
go go go 
uh 
uhhum 
you're going to cross the street you know four lane highway and you're sitting there going 
hey 
or do you want to run over me 
is that what you want to do 
uhhum 
uhhum 
so uh 
but 
it's a 
an adjustment to get back into it but 
but i i do like it up there better as far as uh 
possibilities of uh 
working closer to home and stuff and  not having to worry to 
about a bus and 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
i've  i got a couple three applications in about the kroger's and 
uh 
uh 
but 
a dishwashing job for 
saint angela's nursing home which i kind of like doing 
stuff for 
people that 
like that you know 
uh i worked at a custodian 
at saint rafael's uh 
uh 
home for the aged 
but i had a problem dealing with a one on one basis with the older patients because they were 
they were just visiting you know they weren't there to uh stay you know 
they were 
you know you get kind of on a personal basis with them and 
take couple days off and you come in and say what happened to 
oh she passed away on  oh jesus 
i told her i was bringing her a pack of cigarettes you know you ever get that 
so i mean uh 
yeah you get kind of attached to them and to them and everything and 
oh or then they get 
sick sick you know and 
they move them up to i  used to always sit there and say you know this is 
the only place i ever worked where the 
a move up 
stairs isn't a 
promotion you know it's 
uhhum 
i'd like to uh 
eventually uh 
on immediate future you know get something more permanent as far as work goes uh 
uh 
better 
standard of living uh 
uh 
i'm a veteran so i've got health care and 
but i'm 
need to get 
some other things done though 
um 
continue to um grow in wisdom you know as far as uh 
maybe spirituality or something you know uh 
and eventually get 
kind of my own business where you know uh 
i have a 
want that i want to get a uh 
a spiritual bookstore you know 
and then have uh 
things for everybody you know just come in and 
reading room browse you know 
read the stuff you know take time off to relax because i think one of the 
problems with stress is uh 
and i 
think people are 
are right in saying that we don't get enough exercise 
but uh 
but i think you hafta exercise mentality something 
once in while too and 
and that is trying to make it grow and do a 
to other levels of of uh 
atmosphere 
uhhum 
inspiration motivation i used to have a business when i had first 
quit ashland i had a motivational tape business and everything but uh 
uh 
i tended to 
let that go downhill 
do the 
cocaine and 
other things yeah 
uhhum 
in the wrong  it was just wasn't the right time and uh 
it just 
i had money you know fact i had 
i got like a settlement like thirty some thousand dollars not a settlement but when i sold my stocks and everything i got like thirty some thousand dollars and 
put about 
five thousand here five thousand there still had twenty you know 
started a business and 
money was coming in 
and uh 
using the money for other 
we were using the money for other things and 
not realizing that 
hey you're  be putting that money back in the business you know 
but i was running around with 
bunch of other people that basically were doing the same thing you know so 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
because yeah  i hope to uh 
at forty nine you know i've i've learned a heck of a lot uh 
lot of things i have 
wouldn't want to know you know but i think 
i think i they've been for the good as long as you you turn them around and 
and make them a positive statement for you 
but that's why i'd really like to have is the uh 
uh a bookstore just 
down around campus you know and 
people can come in and 
go over there and relax you know and 
uhhum 
uhhum 
yeah 
yeah something the 
coffee uh 
doughnuts you know or 
uhhum 
but having having done it before you know and uh 
knowing where i went wrong you know 
uh 
that wouldn't happen again 
uh 
talk about all that shit for a while but 
that was again that was back in the uh 
actually it was 
in the nineties early nineties but you know i was 
been doing it when we were 
we were 
as a recreation type of thing you know not as a uh 
daily you know 
uhhum 
somebody come knocking on our door  
oh yeah okay oh yeah oh yeah 
yeah stupid 
but i'd like to do something like that then uh 
uh i wouldn't mind having uh 
uh 
some kind of place for uh 
you know you see a lot of uh 
different down and out type people and everything and 
and 
really nobody really trying to help them or nothing you know and uh 
uh 
i like to think that 
maybe even this thing you know could be like a sanctuary for them to come in and get some peace of mind or something you know 
so 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
yeah i can 
i'm 
two thirty five 
yeah 
i was a little late though when i got here but 
four five 
ew and i hate hearing myself on 
okay 
i might want to try to adjust this a little bit again if you say it goes under my  
putting it under here 
help 
not 
it was better before 
there 
that's better 
that's okay 
okay 
so i can just talk normal and it won't be too loud because i talk loud 
okay 
so when i start laughing real loud you can 
turn it down so no one breaks their ear drums 
yes 
thirty nine 
uh north end 
over by riverside hospital 
henderson olentangy 
yeah 
um currently unemployed 
uhhum 
so 
yeah i'm looking for work um taking my time looking for work 
it's the first chance that i've had in probably twenty years to sit back and get what i want 
so i'm doing that 
getting unemployment and taking my time i've got 
several interviews so 
some exciting ones so 
um secretarial 
administrative assistant 
type work 
uh i'm kind of happy i'm not doing that anymore it really takes a certain  type of person to work for in that's hard to find 
in that area so 
uh in insurance off and on working for independent insurance agents 
so i did that until i 
uh came to a company that i stayed with for seven years 
and then they relocated to dallas 
so yeah 
um 
i didn't wanna go to dallas 
so there was a couple people that went but probably two out of five hundred 
and nobody wanted to 
so i stayed here 
oh probably my family 
my kids are here 
i have a grandchild now so 
yeah i like to stay 
close to all them 
she is four months 
almost five 
yeah 
so i'm a new grandma 
thanks 
i don't feel like a grandma either so 
have to be careful what i do they still watch me i guess 
uh-oh 
oh 
that's fun and that's a challenging age 
too thirteen months that's fun 
yeah 
um 
no 
i got to babysit for like a week and then she has a best friend that's watching her baby and 
a friend of hers that has other kids too so it's real good for the baby 
uhhum 
yeah it's my daughter 
yeah 
uhhum 
uh 
she's actually at uh columbus state 
she's gonna study to be a teacher 
so she's doing that and uh 
uhhum 
yeah 
yeah 
she's nineteen 
yeah 
oh gosh a whole lot more people 
whole lot more places to live seems like everywhere i turn there's construction and and 
you know you go down one one road and then you wait a couple years if you don't go in that area and 
it's all changed 
looks all different 
so and that's mainly like looking at bethel 
and 
three fifteen north things like that 
yeah 
think the population 
um 
in a way 
but i think it also 
leaves it open for all the things of 
having too many people in one area 
um 
i don't i don't know i think the main thing that affects me now and since i've been home 
i've been reading the paper a lot more and 
you know i'm more aware of what's going on and 
i really um gonna be some kind of activist 
for 
um 
i don't know a lot of the places that are coming up the gentleman's clubs and things like that i just i think that's gonna be really bad 
for the kids and and everybody around 
um there's one off of uh bethel 
or no it's off of henderson cahoots 
and then there's the red hot peppers or something i saw the other day and 
i couldn't even believe they're like right across the street from each other 
you know and 
it's funny because you read the paper and and it seems like so many people are concerned about kids and education and all that but then they 
let all that stuff so 
thinking it really affects it 
yeah 
try to go around 
and until they make a women's uh club 
won't be real 
uh um 
i'm sure that it has because it enables a lot more people to get housing and 
and things like that 
um 
and i and you know growth is always good my husband's in construction so i shouldn't be against it or anything but 
um you kind of like to have things spread out and kind of you know 
have some space 
so 
um 
i work downtown 
the last year i worked downtown and then i think about 
oh probably fifteen twenty years ago i worked downtown 
and um 
you know as far as the focus you mean like nighttime things or just anything in general or 
yeah 
well i think it would be good if it expanded out a little bit more i mean it's smaller compared to most downtowns 
i mean you 
you know it seems like you just drive through in two minutes and you're out 
i don't think it that would hurt anything and then to live there if they made it more affordable 
that would be nice 
so 
uh i live up north 
um 
around carl and 
uh morse road 
so i have a house 
oh 
then you wouldn't be too familiar with everything huh 
uhhum 
northland mall 
yeah 
with all the controversy about that and polaris and 
uhhum 
um 
i don't know  it's 
northland is such a 
a good location for all the people around there and it's certainly not 
you know um 
um 
a hurting  or you know a neighborhood that 
people don't need 
the shopping so i didn't see the difference of having both 
there's lazarus everywhere there's sears everywhere why not have it both places 
i mean i wouldn't particularly go up to polaris if they take northland 
but we're not planning on staying there anyway so i didn't 
yeah 
we will probably move within the year 
uhhum 
um the well 
i've had the house 
excuse me 
um 
for probably six seven years and 
we just need to move it's kind of small it's a smaller house 
and um 
my husband works in gahanna so we were gonna 
look for some houses up that way and 
maybe some land 
we've been looking at some land 
up north too 
uhhum 
yeah 
it's either gonna be find a house we want or we will go build it 
oh 
a place on some land 
with  woods and uh 
yeah 
water things like that 
right 
yeah we could put a little trailer there we'd be outside most the time anyway so 
uhhum 
yeah 
yeah i would say anything outside 
like doing that 
uhhum 
yeah 
we'd like to garden 
and that was one of the things too we want some space to 
to make a bigger garden and 
uh no 
uh no we kind of help my neighbor out he's got a big garden next 
so we help him and 
he's retired 
oh 
good because i don't think i'd know that one 
whatever looks pretty when it 

uh it's all over they contract with dominion homes 
and dominion is seems like it's going up everywhere and m i 
so they're all over 
uh they have projects all over 
uh it's not really an office he's like a um supervisor that just goes to the different job sites 
he  he tells the the crew members what houses to work on and which ones are ready and 
and then he gets to 
um 
talk with  the other contractors 
and he works together with them but he's really just 
there's a main place where they park all their trucks and then he just goes to the different sites 
right 
yeah 
and they're all so different but he's he deals real well with people 
so he's really 
and he's even thinking of going into uh business 
for himself 
yeah he almost  that this year and then he thought nah i don't want all the headaches 
so he's like the top guy of  of the people that he works for so 
yeah 
yeah 
it'd be good though because i could take care to the books and everything and 
do all that kind of thing so 
uhhum 
yeah 
yeah we probably eventually will do that 
but i'm like so up in the air about what i wanna do and there's 
many things to do out there that 
i need to take time to think about it 
so 
no 
no 
i really don't i've done uh i've done a variety of uh 
different 
things and then also um 
just reading 
and and things uh since i've been off and 
i  i wanted to go back to school i thought about that and 
i wanna do something with kids 
i almost thought of opening my own daycare center 
but then i didn't know if i wanted to get into that and 
so 
just trying to 
take my time 
do what i wanna do 
yeah 
oh 
um 
yeah 
well and that's good for the baby 
too 
yeah 
oh 
gosh i hate that's really going around a lot 
well 
um 
let's see i got divorced when my oldest was three and my youngest was about six months almost a year 
so i've 
i've raised them basically myself 
yeah so i did go back to work 
uh  five years ago almost five years ago couple months 
short of that 
oh 
yeah 
i um well and that was really um 
struggle 
you know a struggle for money and everything so 
i would take whatever would come along 
and when you work in secure 
jobs like that i mean you i had a different job 
every year 
i mean a year would come up and i'd say okay here we go 
you know they're either gonna downsize or they're gonna 
do something and they always did so i was never really shocked 
and i didn't panic or anything  i was never without a job and never had to 
i never missed 
um 
you know 
i would say it would take 
probably two weeks 
at the most 
before i would be working again 
yeah 
uhhum 
yeah 
eighty four 
yeah 
um 
yeah pretty good for secretarial administrative type work i mean everybody's always looking for that 
so but i had some really tough challenging jobs and 
yeah if i knew now what i knew then i probably could be a millionaire with all the lawsuits of 
different yeah i experience with 
um sexual harassment 
yeah real bad and and it was 
you know mainly um 
no one talked about it 
you know i mean it was just like 
and then it also put a mark on you to go somewhere else 
so you would never wanna 
you know ever say anything 
but um yeah that  
well 
i walked out and uh it wasn't quietly 
and i 
but it felt good 
and uh 
and i didn't even know if i was gonna be living in the streets 
but i will never forget the day you know and his wife worked in the office too 
so i went to her and i said it was nice working with you i'm going home you know 
can reach me at home 
and then he was shocked and he just couldn't believe it and he said you can't do this 
he says i won't pay you 
and i said  
uh you know watch me walk out the door and i don't want any money you know 
so i left out 
um 
oh it was just a 
a long drawn out thing i mean it  started out with little things 
and then it just got bigger like 
um 
he had an office 
off of the main office and it was a pretty prominent uh insurance company 
and he had his own um agency and he was a successful i mean he's probably still is out there very successful 
but i was doing some computer training and he was walking me to the other side of the 
building 
and he locked the door 
and turned around 
he said why don't you get the  or the front door 
and it was only he and i in the office you know and every once in a while his wife would be in there 
and i just i lost it i was i uh 
i was mad but i i didn't want him to think that i was afraid 
i wanted to 
be of him to be afraid of me 
so i just 
i stomped back to my desk 
and i said oh  i said not only are you a pain to work with i have to be afraid of you 
and then i think i did scare him because he start you know he backed off a lot 
and 
just his personality and his his 
and then that that was a real um 
slap in the face for him 
so he was really mean after that so i left i just i walked out 
i picked the kids up at the bus stop and they're like mommy what are you doing 
i said we're going somewhere   get in the 
so 
but um 
yeah just couple experiences like that though make you do other things so 
you know i stayed 
tough and i 
you know got other jobs and 
was pretty good never had to borrow any money 
never went on welfare 
didn't 
i think i was on food stamps or something for a month 
when i first 
you know 
got a divorce 
so it's been hard 
um uh 
he was in so much trouble 
and he was 
that was the main reason why i didn't stay with him is he was just draining on me and 
pulling me down so 
he was never really there he was in and out of jail all the time 
and i would go through the whole 
um 
bureau child support 
that whole thing and that was a 
total mess 
he'd have wasted all the time to go down there to court appearances and all this other stuff well 
it turned out he could just move 
he found out he could just move 
yeah so you know he always got away from that 
oh yeah 
uhhum 
yeah 
i think they're really helpful and i think that it's the only way that a single mom or anybody raising kids can make it there's really 
but there's so much fraud 
and there's so many people that take advantage of it that it hurts the other people that really need it 
you know like with me i didn't wanna stay on it i wanted to be on my own and i was perfectly capable of it 
but if 
i  didn't have the ambition 
that that i had i might have stayed home there's like nine you know 
there was even a mother that lived across from me in my apartment complex that 
i would get up and go to work every day 
and she would have food delivered to the her front step 
and she drove that year's  
i mean she had a brand new 
you know like whatever year it was that's the car she had and i 
i would just shake my head and wonder how she ever got away with it and 
you know i thought 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah she probably got um 
i don't know maybe even she sold drugs or you know whatever kind of way she made her money 
but it wouldn't have been enough 
welfare wise to get a 
car and to 
support the her 
living conditions or whatever 
uhhum 
yeah 
yeah you can hide a lot of that and get away with it for long time which you know i'm sure she did 
i don't know i always thought 
um 
i always thought it would be neat to have 
a system like the police have 
if you don't pay a speeding ticket there's a warrant for your arrest and they come after you 

if you don't make a child support payment 
they should do the same thing i don't know why they don't have a system like that 
yeah i think that's  you know i'm i'm not that familiar with it now but 
i think that they are getting better and and seeing the cracks and things like that the people fall through 
yeah that's 
right 
right 
yep 
but uh fifty dollars a week 
you know you can do anything for fifty dollars a week you know you could work two two hours a day 
you know for a week and and fifty dollars for two kids 
is really not that much a week so 
that'd be two hundred dollars a month 
yeah that was the most somebody could be 
um ordered to pay 
being unemployed 
and i think  yeah eighty four 
yeah so they adjusted that but then they didn't have any way to 
um 
enforce that so 
yeah 
well 
i was gonna say i i've seen situations too where i can see their side of it 
as well because 
the mothers are used to or the wives are used to being home 
and the husbands support them and in those situations they still want them to 
they still don't want to go out there and do that and 
um 
and 
you know they need to look at each one of those cases too 
because i know there's alimony and all that kind of thing and 
and that can be 
detrimental to the man because he can never go out and have another life or have another wife and you know 
and he does have a responsibility but i think there can be a line drawn 
to how responsible he is and 
how capable the other half would have been you know 
right 
right 
oh yeah 
yeah 
yeah well there's too many situations out there 
to have everybody fit in to certain 
ones that just everyone of them's different 
not really 
no i was too proud 
i would have never 
i would have never 
i think my dad paid my first month's rent 
for me though 
i paid him back 
and then i never i never wanted to borrow any money 
i guess just growing up 
the youngest of five 
i appreciated 
money 
and i didn't even want you know and i knew 
my mom is like if she can save a nickel somewhere you know she will 
so i knew that that's how they were and i didn't want to you know it was my choice to get married it was my choice to have kids and 
you know i didn't i didn't feel 
the need to ask them 
um well i think 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah so 
yeah they're ok they're parents they're in their seventies now 
i 
i take what i need and leave the rest because they've got their own opinions that are 
a lot different than mine 
so 
uh my brother lives in connecticut 
um and he's uh with a cement company 
concrete 
i'm not even really sure i've never even seen him 
where he lives 
seen pictures and he comes and visits a lot but i've never 
gone up there 
um and his wife's an opera singer so she's real busy and 
they they just are madly in love he got divorced after seventeen years of 
marriage 
and found the wife that he has now they've been married for probably almost 
oh i don't know 
seven eight years 
and they're real happy 
and his kids are grown and they have kids and 
yeah the family is really pretty big the immediate family just us is thirty two 
with our husband's wives and kids 
yeah 
so then i have another sister  that was married to a doctor and just recently divorced 
she's one of the ones that wants to 
it's unfair you know life is unfair nothing ever works and 
so um she's living in akron 
in a house completely paid for by herself 
and 
lives out in the middle of nowhere and complains how lonely she is 
then i told her if it was me 
completely alone i'd be in the middle of a city somewhere 
you know where you see people and 
i don't know you know it's just 
you can always see what someone else 
should do or could do whatever 
i she's always trying to recruit people to come and 
but it's like a two hour drive 
and then 
everybody's busy you know that's four hours of driving 
and um 
i don't know it's just too hard to 
keep everybody 
in touch that way 
but 
yeah i have two other sisters 
um 
one of them is well it's funny because we're all divorced 
out the five of us we're all on 
one of them is on her third marriage and we're all on our second 
except for one she's divorced and she hasn't remarried 
and then my oldest that i told you in akron i guess she's not remarried 
yeah 
four girls 
uhhum 
yeah 
and then my other sister 
just recently got divorced 
um this year 
or i guess it was um final end of last year 
and she's got two kids 
and raising them and 
so they're all um most of them except for um linda and bobby 
bobby's the one in 
uh connecticut and linda's in akron 
but everybody else is within ten minutes of each other 
ten fifteen minutes 
so 
yeah we stay pretty close see each other a lot 
yeah and i'm closer to the ones that that feel the same way i do about 
my oldest sister you know 
i can stay on the phone so long but we have such different opinions about things that yeah i don't stay on very long with her 
oh its real negative she's real negative about things and 
and tries to put me down for being positive or 
you know i always see a way out of something and she doesn't 
and she i think she gets kind of mad 
and plus she is feels like she's old at fifty and i said oh my gosh 
you don't even have any bad habits i said 
you know you could live to be a hundred that's fifty more years 
you know i mean if you look at it that way 
she's really 
you know fifty is not old 
at all to me i mean that's just 
you as much as you learn 
you know 
you can't trade but 
yeah my my one sister that's um 
exactly seven years older than me 
we're the closest 
and then the sister that's two years older than me 
she's the same way 
she does a lot of things that i'm like why are you doing that you know 
don't 
so she's she pretty much stays 
low and depressed a lot because of everything she goes through but 
oh yeah 
yeah we all get together 
we have to get a shelter house now somewhere because uh 
is big enough 
well and then we have so many little kids 
that it's great because uh we just go to a shelter 
inside and they have it you know like for christmas and things like that and 
they can run around the kids run around and 
yeah 
and then you can stay as long as you want you don't 
you know feel obligated 
and everybody just brings in food 
you know everybody brings their own stuff and it's fun we've 
yeah it is 
from thanksgiving to christmas i mean it's just nonstop 
family everywhere 
so it's fun 
not me it's too  
oh 
yeah 
i contributed to too many people 
there's too many people there's not enough commitment 
it's too easy to get divorced 
and 
it uh the competition 
i mean there's just tons and tons of 
um just people 
everywhere and 
young people today i don't 
i you know i don't know what the statistics are gonna be but 
they 
i don't think they have a good idea of what marriage even is 
you know before 
and also before a marriage was a commitment to  a type of lifestyle 
and that lifestyle's gone everybody's independent 
everybody's going their own ways 
and if you happen to be lucky enough to find somebody that 
is looking in the same direction you are and 
is equally as independent 
then  might it might work 
but um 
i you know 
and who knows why each person gets divorced i mean each one of them was an individual 
situation 
and uh 
oh yeah 
yeah 
yeah i know i was really young when i met my husband i was fourteen 
in high school so we kind of grew up together and 
i didn't know anything else 
and um just two complete different people 
you know different needs and 
everything else so 
yeah well i didn't realize that until i had kids 
and i had two little girls 
and i thought wait a minute you know i my whole life changed because 
my commitment was to them and to 
you know get all the opportunities that were out there for them 
and 
and it just didn't happen that you know 
well that we both had the same 
he wanted everything to be the same 
you know 
so i think that really changed everything 
one could have 
it does you're whole focus changes because 
everything you say somebody's listening and everything you want to do somebody's watching and 

you know you have to be a good example 
i mean if you 
if you're just that for your 
then 
all they 
you know you might not always do the right things or say the right things but 
if you're taking care of yourself and you stay positive and do the 
then 
think that's the best you can do for them 
well 
uh yeah i think it's real important to really good uh 
get a good 
feel for how you are and 
all your beliefs and all that they have to really match 
and um 
and if they don't 
um 
then it's not ever going to work because because there's always gonna be 
conflict and 
friction and all that kind of thing so i think it's real important 
and there's no age limit on that to when you really feel 
about yourself and you really know what you want to do 
then that's the only time that you can really commit 
and say yeah we do have a mutual 
thing 
and young people 
their 
you know there's so many different infatuations to start with 
that they get blinded and they get 
you know 
off course and everything else and 
and then it doesn't stay the same 
i mean it's all exciting and 
and all that 
and then it you know i think it's kind of 
oh yeah 
i was never gonna get married again i had my house my kids you know i had already done that 
i was financially secure and i didn't 
i wasn't even looking 
one of my best friends though at the time 
uh she saw this 
guy she  he was the roommate of a guy she was seeing 
and i talked to this girl 
every day and she's like 
oh you have to meet him you have to meet him 
i was like oh you know call me tomorrow i don't 
meet anybody 
so it took a long time for us to be introduced but then as soon as we were 
she was right 
i mean uh we were like inseparable from 
probably of two weeks 
after we met 
we just i've 
haven't been without him 
so 
yeah 
and it's been five years this year that we've been married 
and uh close to seven that i've known him so 
and it's still just as exciting it's still just as good and 
yeah he amazes me everyday because i'm 
i'm one to 
all this won't last forever but 
you know 
and he's like well when we're ninety 
you know you will know 
so 
yeah 
i know 
its good one of us 
no but he has a daughter 
and that was from high school 
um 
his girlfriend 
yeah i got pregnant 
and then 
he stayed with her and they tried to work 
out and they never got married and 
that was when you lived in canada 
so she lives in canada now and he goes 
you know he talks to her all the time 
and then they're real 
open about that i mean she's real good about letting 
the little girl come 
and she will stay the 
us and 
you know he will drive up there and see her 
uhhuh 
his daughter's twelve 
yeah 
yeah 
um seventeen and nineteen 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah and 
uh she's adorable 
uh she's real good 
yeah 
yeah everything's healthy 
and great um 
she and then my daughter i mean i think she's just gonna be a real good influence she's a single mom 
and um 
the father 
is in another relationship and probably on his way to be getting married and 
you know so it doesn't look like he's gonna be in the picture that much 
and 
she had trouble trying to decide whether she wanted him 
to be too 
so 
because you 
right 
he doesn't seem 
he doesn't seem to have any problem it's always been you know what ever she 
i know 
so far 
it's worked out 
pretty well so you know i'm sure in a situation like that things are gonna come up 
but we will we will deal with it 
yeah 
no 
yeah 
well she stayed um 
she stayed with us 
like for the first 
and then she was done she was like ready to go 
so and that was okay but 
her apartment 
lease was up 
the 
uh week 
that she was in the hospital having the baby 
so i had to move her 
and uh my husband's family was visiting at the time 
and so 
his mom stayed she lives in florida 
and she stayed with me 
and helped me pack her whole apartment 
and 
get her in to her new apartment and 
and that was just you know 
well i know 
and you know when i think back about that week that was just crazy 
because it was on a saturday morning she went into labor 
so i was up 
all night 
saturday and 
all day sunday i didn't get home till 
sunday night 
and then 
oh his his brother from vancouver 
his daughter from canada 
and his 
mom from florida 
were staying with us 
and they were leaving that tuesday 
so 
yeah it was like 
yeah uh  was 
five weeks early 
delivering 
so it was really you know unplanned as far as when we were expecting it 
yeah 
you were past ready 
yeah 
yeah 
oh gosh 
oh 
well 
when you think about the different generations and things we certainly didn't have the things to worry about 
who knows in elementary and junior high and 
we would have never dreamed 
of anybody having good 
or even in let alone a knife 
i mean that 
and that's violence and that's that goes back to kids 
and how much time and and effort you put in to them 
you know kids are ignored and pushed aside and they're in the way and there's so many people that 
don't even want them and 
you know and then they get in to school and they get violent 
and they they take it out  you know and everybody's surprised 
you know 
i'm not because i know there's a lot of anger and a lot of hate for these little kids 
and um 
and going to school 
is getting to be so dangerous 
i think 
because you have so many of them in one little room 
and they're coming from so many different backgrounds 
and if you take each one of their situations 
i can bet the statistics as time goes on 
that 
they  
they're not gonna have 
one caring parent 
you know maybe not even one of the parents 
you know they might have a foster family or 
you know somebody that wants to pretend like they care you know there's a lot of the people that 
that are foster families that only want the money 
you know and 
and there's  all that so 
it's 
it's really scary and i think 
i think that it had something has to be done real 
i think it starts from 
what we teach them 
and as adults what we allow 
to be out there 
the computers 
i mean oh my gosh 
i didn't even get a computer because i was so afraid of what 
they could be able to 
access there was not 
you know 
there was nothing barred at 
all when they first came out 
yeah 
and you know where are all those software people they're not responsible for 
y two k they're not responsible for 
you know all this internet access to all the stuff 
so it's really hard 
well when you have formulas to make bombs and you know 
how to 
uh step by step of how to commit suicide and 
yeah they have to be responsible i think 
because you know you put an idea in to somebody's head and then 
when you give them the resources to carry 
those things out 
i think it's 
it has to be 
for a lot of it 
yeah 
yeah 
but it 
and it's 
it's parents that fight for 
the 
and the what's in your community 
you know the parents for each individual child 
they have to all form together as a group 
and almost be 
all parents to 
all these kids 
as a group 
you know it's not 
you can be the best parent in the world at home 
and then your kid goes to school and it accesses the computer or they 
get in a group of kids where their 
parents they don't even know where they are 
you know it's the kids responsibility to get 
and go to school 
you know maybe the mom and dad didn't even come home the night before but 
you know i mean there's all different kinds of situations 
so i think it does start with parents because they need to be aware of what 
all the kids are being 
um 
shown and 
and have access to 
yeah 
yeah you really do 
yeah 

oh yeah 
yeah 
right and you know what's gonna happen 
it's only when it gets so bad 
that they can't even walk to their car they can't even go to 
to the store 
without being affected by that they can't say that anymore 
you know it's the people that 
if i don't see it it's not there 
they're the ones that are gonna be the most shocked 
and they're the ones that are gonna be 
panicked 
when everything you know because it's getting smaller the world's getting smaller we're 
we're more populated now than we ever have been 
so people need to learn to work together and to be together 
and 
gosh 
you know that's one of the things that i've really you know when i read the paper i think wow what can you do 
it has to start there first 
you know and i think if 
um 
and i 
and this might be because i'm a woman but 
i think if women 
started running things 
it would be a lot different than when men 
run things because 
men tend to 
think you know like the government and that kind of thing 
those 
kind of um 
funds 
that are available for different organizations and 
they're all geared toward things that 
essentially help them 
as a whole 
or help um 
well 
yeah but i mean not so much that um 
it's always been the women's responsibility to be responsible for the kids 
or to care about their well being and the a 
peaceful environment and all that kind of thing 
men are more 
let's go get it and you know we need more money and 
you know they're 
yeah more 
yeah or more 
you know i don't i don't even know 
because to start it's just such a huge problem and it's gotten so out of hand 
it's gonna be everybody all together that has to work it's gonna be the teachers and the 
government and 
everybody but they all have to have one common thing 
and it cracks me up because 
we're so concerned about elian 
this this poor little kid 
everybody knows who he is 
but 
you know you look at our own kids we don't even care about our own kids as much as we care 
i mean here's this little kid 
who still has a living parent 
and and i don't understand that at all i mean that is just so 
i think the government gets involved in 
totally you know 
way out of line 
and 
yeah 
yeah 
i don't i don't know but it then then they second guess 
the mother and she risked her life and all and they 
they can't do that 
i mean you know it's too bad that 
you know she wasn't there to 
to go on with what they were planning on doing but 
it's not our right to to take other countries kids even 
i mean that's another thing 
i mean come to america we will take everyone and every you know 
but then we have all these this crime 
because we have all these terrorist people that come from i mean that's all they've grown up with 
is the terrorist activities and 
the mentality and all that they come here and if they can't make it 
then they will just bomb somewhere and 
then 
but i see a lot of that too a lot of the crime is a lot of foreign things that you know you uh you kind of 
wanna do a study of how long they've been here and 
you know 
that'd be interesting 
um i think there's gotta be a line drawn 
and i think that um 
you know if they're 
if they're caught 
um and and it's any kind of crime or anything and i know they send them back 
but um 
i just think that we're just too open with that and there's gotta be a line to say 
this is as many people as as we care to you know 
i mean and i know that's hard but 
and it's hard to draw the line but then other countries 
if it's so miserable there 
then they need to work on their 
country 
because 
whoa i yeah really 
um 
yeah one is still in high school and she 
she's ready to she wants to go on to college 
so she's pretty much 
ready 
to go i mean she do she's got one more year 
of high school but 
uh and i held her back in kindergarten 
so she's 
older graduate she will be nineteen when she graduates 
and then  on the other hand graduated when she was seventeen 
so 
um 
then my youngest daughter amy she is uh 
she's doing real well i mean she's getting really good grades a's and b's 
and um 
with  
she had kind of a hard time 
in high school 
she was 
uh raped 
by a teacher in ninth grade 
when she first went into a school 
and from there it's just been a nightmare of what 
how that it's affected her 
you know anything she goes through you blame it on that or you go back and you say oh i wonder 
you know if she was like that because of this and 
you know so that's been a real struggle and high school 
i was 
i never really 
was that um excited about it for her because the memories she has 
she went on to a different school and she met a lot of good people there 
and she 
yeah 
yeah ever authority figures at all 
you know she's she's really strong about that though because 
um 
she doesn't look at anybody being 
be uh 
you know maybe 
more wiser more experienced in things but 
you know certainly she doesn't trust anybody 
yeah 
yeah and that's the thing about schools too 
you know 
i 
totally disagree with uniforms 
you know unless it's 
all slacks 
all of it 
because you get the 
the girls in the uniforms and they're short 
and they can't enforce that they don't enforce that 
and the day that my daughter came home and told me that this one teacher put the whole the girls up in the front row 
i should have went and met him 
or i should have said hey you know hey this uh you know 
haven't met me and i and i really 
you know fault myself for that 
but it's made me more aware too and i 
you know when you look at someone and you say oh you would never dream that they 
well i do 
you know there isn't anything i don't 
put past anybody doing 
i really don't cause they just 
yeah 
oh 
no 
no i do because there's some good ones out there there's some bad ones too but you know 
yeah 
um it's awareness again 
i mean 
you know put two and two together you get some young 
teachers 
right out of of college 
and then you put m with all these high school girls and these girls are looking like twenty and twenty two i mean 
you can't even 
you can't control the attraction there 
but you can be aware of it 
and you can 
you can um 
put the put slacks on girls and not leave it up to them to choose the height of their skirts and 
you know and 
they've got stairs up and down and 
you know they get in their lockers and they bend over you know and that's 
that's just too much 
i mean i think that's the first thing that has to be done take away 
that you know they shouldn't even be 
uh that shouldn't even be a thought 
you know 
and it's distracting enough for the the guys their own age 
but then you put these young teachers in there maybe they're single guys that were just had a hell of a time in hall in college 
and then they get around all these girls and like oh my gosh 
well you know you gotta look at that you gotta be more aware 
um 
i think 
i think that there should be 
a mandatory because you have it in big companies you have mandatory um sexual harassment tapes 
and 
and you learn you teach the girls 
that it's not what they do it's how they make you feel 
is is 
constituted as your uh 
yeah harassment there 
and they're too afraid 
and then besides that they you know there's crushes on you know you can't fault the girls for having crushes and 
things like that they're going through enough things as it is 
but you can make them aware if somebody 
as an adult steps over that 
line 
or makes them uncomfortable 
you know 
there should be some kind of a s 
a system 
to where these girls the slightest bit 
you know it's anonymous it's 
you know 
probably but they don't they won't 
you know 
part of is they feel flattered part of it is like wow the you know this guy thinks i'm nice looking or whatever 

and you know you can have a hard thing there but 
then if you teach the teachers that they're not gonna be quiet and they're not gonna 
you know um look at this flattery 
right 
you know that's that's the thing so 
i think just being aware 
and then also 
like i said with uh with all the 
i mean 
and i'm uh 
i'm so 
opinionated in this too and anybody that 
knows me 
i look at all the advertising 
i look at the advertising and i look through and like i see lazarus and i see kohl's and i see 
sears 
you look through and you say oh okay you know you're looking for things to buy well then you got a two whole 
two pages 
of women in bras 
and they're looking at the camera they're seductively looking at the camera 
and 
you're like okay how many  how many different bras do women really need 
not for the women i'm sorry you know 
most women by the time they're  buying bras know what choices they have 
don't need all that 
but then it's funny because then i keep flipping through and i look at the men 
the men's heads are usually cut off 
they're not wearing any kind of revealing 
underwear at all i mean it's just so 
unequal so 
we lead these these guys or these poor boys that are growing up 
we push all this and you know 
and then expect them to deal with it 
you know and they see tv shows and 
and everything else that you know 
it's okay to be with five women but boy that woman is with more than one man and she's you know 
i mean i think it's what we teach our kids and that goes back to the government and society and 
and what we're allowed to to show our kids 
you know you get involved in the free speech 
and that's fine 
but wait till those kids grow up 
and and wait till those people that were pushing the free speech 
gets mugged  or you know anything else happens to them 
um 
the yeah um 
or the yeah the government 
mayors the you know but then look at them 
i mean there's another example 
well yeah well i mean 
so that's not the  that's not the case but it's all it's an uh uh man too 
you know i mean i think women would be more efficient and they would see those things because we've had to live with them forever 
you know even g movies that little kids are going to see 
if there's a woman in there 
there she's you know half naked 
and she's 
should be a center fold somewhere 
you know and those are little  yeah 
disney movies cartoons 
i mean when you look at that you see it everywhere and it's really scary 
um but nobody's doing anything about it that i can see 
and they don't really see a concern but like i said 
wait till the generations start growing up 
wait till those little kids that we've put all those things in their head 
grows up 
then they will think wow we should have done something 
i know well i'm 
i'm scared i hope i don't live real long because 
it's it's scary well and then the guy that um 
i don't even remember what his name was he got 
a drunk driving 
charge 
a judge he was a judge 
now he's out 
he went back to work on monday 
so you know what kind of example is he setting for everybody else 
oh we throw the book away 
on some of these other  i mean the throw the key away 
on some of these guys 
and 
you know we want set them an as an example and 
you know this one guy had one 
d u i two years ago so we really  to he's gotta be in jail for five years you know 
then this judge 
i mean he's got 
probably ten years of history with drugs and alcohol 
and he's still and he's still a judge 
monday morning he goes to work 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah i don't see figure that out i think it's all 
i think it's all 
yeah they don't know about it but then 
you know they 
like you said they don't wanna see it 
you know 
if it doesn't affect them it's not there 
and if they don't have to 
yeah 
well people's 
people don't have the priorities they should 
you know 
what do you do you work all your life and you make a lot of money and then you die 
what did you do 
you know 
did you learn anything did you teach anyone did you have an opinion about anything 
you know 
i not to me if you don't have time then 
you know you're just floating along trying to 
taking up space no 
yeah we 
yup 
you have to concentrate on what's important or it just flies by and you don't even see it 
yeah 
yeah right 
can't take it with you or something 
yeah 
right 
yeah well you can't even put a price on it either 
so it's 
no 
i think i thrive on stress 
i think it keeps me uh going or something 
but i do have to do something that 
is accomplishing something 
i don't wanna sit in an office i've already done that 
day in and day out working for other people that i don't even approve of 
that are making way too much money anyway 
and uh have to 
well looking at me oh you want a dollar more you know i mean 
and they're making thousands 
um but yeah i don't wanna do that any more i wanna go somewhere i've got somebody 
helping me kind of you know um just an acquaintance of mine 
um that's kind of a headhunter 
and i've given him the idea that 
i wanna either work for an attorney that's gonna make some changes or 
you know do something that way i've got a lot of administration 
you know 
and and manager and things like that background so 
i can have fun doing what i know how to do but also 
accomplishing something 
that's what i wanna do i haven't found it yet i've got an interview with a radio station though and that's kinda 
off the thing a 
because that will be fun 
yeah just in their 
corporate offices 
and that would be fun so 
eventually i will have my own radio 
if they interviewed me and knew that they'd be like quick get that girl out of here 
no but that that's like the most exciting 
thing right now is that i mean that looks real 
promising but 
and if i do that then i'm gonna have to do something 
voluntary 
or some 
uh 
voluntary work or uh 
choices 
uh i looked at that too that's choices for domestic violence 
that's an organization that i think would be real interesting and 
help me feel like you know 
helping people 
um they give 
uh 
new direction for abused 
uh wives and mothers and 
um help them get on their feet you know give them access to the different organizations that are out there 
basically hide them until they can get on their own because if they're abused the 
husbands are like you know a nightmare out there 
so things like that 
yeah i'd be so frustrated i'd probably 
oh 
i would be really 
oh 
oh 
wow 
oh see and she's probably really good 
yeah see 
yup 
really 
yeah 
i don't feel old at all i mean i 
you know a lot of people think wow you should know what you wanna do or you know 
and 
and i guess 
there is different phases like uh maslow's 
hierarchy 
what is that the um the hierarchy of needs 
Maslow 
anyway 
he has different levels of things that people need different ages and things like that uh 
you know and at forty 
you you think wow you know and you really need to 
make a difference or do something and and i can see that cause i've gone through all the phases that he's talking about so 
yeah 
right 
yeah 
okay 
oh 
no that's fine 
thanks 
oh 
oh i was gonna say it would be interesting 
yep 
um okay well i'm not really from columbus either 
i've been here for a little over a year now 
my husband went to high school here 
and had a  
daughter while he was in high school so 
after he finished college he wanted to relocate here 
and we kind of live between worthington and westerville 
kind of 
north 
columbus 
and i like it a lot 
i'm 
i've always lived in ohio 
so i'm a native ohioian 
southern ohio 
uhhum 
right now i'm staying at home with my two boys i have a one year old and a five year old 
and um my profession is a nurse i'm a yeah 
but i've 
been taking a little while off since i've had the baby 
uhhum 
and um 
i i've pretty much have 
picked up the belief in attachment parenting since i've had my second child 
and i  
it's where you believe in breast feeding 
from birth 
until whenever and holding you know like 
carrying the baby in a sling with you and 
just being available for the baby's needs and just 
no not really 
oh 
i i feel a huge difference for me personally 
um 
just in the um 
closeness and 
being able to pick up on his cues a lot better 
and just knowing his needs 
and being able to meet them quicker and 
more effectively i think 
so yeah 
oh yeah 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
i know 
uhhum 
that's another thing i forgot to mention 
uhhum 
exactly 
just from family 
uhhum 
oh yeah 
yeah 
but it was something i've learned just from the other parents 
well  
mostly mothers that 
i you know talk to is 
that you know 
if it's not necessary 
to 
say it then it's necessary not to say it so 
it's just kind of a 
in your home type of thing and you don't really go around saying 
yeah we sleep in the same bed and 
we breast feed still and 
you just kind of they ask and you're like yeah well 
yeah that's just the way we're doing it so 
uhhum 
uhhum 
yeah 
how appaling oh yeah 
yeah 
my my family my mom especially is just like when are you gonna stop 
doing that 
yeah because he's sixteen months now and 
i think he's tapering off quite a bit so 
i think that he will be done soon but i'm not pushing him so 
i think so 
he's he's not being forced to go in any direction that he's not ready for 
yeah i was going to college and 
and going to work and 
i mean i think that their personalities are different too though 
so he was very independent but i'm not sure that that's just 
his personality or if it was just he was adapting to his environment and where he was put being put and 
being in daycare from a very very young age and 
and then 
you know my youngest he's never been in daycare at all 
so 
it just 
just kind of 
instincts i 
yeah actually there are 
quite a there's an 
an a well pretty well known doctor that has a ton of books and 
i go to la leche league and 
that's kind of their philosophy in a way 
yeah 
just that breast feeding 
is you know a way to mother 
and nurture and feed and you know it 
it meets all of these needs it's kind of like 
it's just 
yeah 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
oh i believe it 
uhhum 
yeah 
well one of my la leche league leaders she has a p h d 
and she does a lot of reading 
and she said that she actually read a study 
that they did um for breast fed babies to bottle fed babies 
and they said the difference in their i q 
is equivalent to uh 
a regular 
bottle fed baby 
and a baby exposed to lead poisoning 
it's that much higher even  so i mean it's just given them that much of uh 
better 
head start 
on development 
so 
that's fine 
uhhum 
i don't 
my husband does but i kind of sleep between them when they're 
but right now i've cause we've 
early on we 
took our bed down and just kind of had like the mattress and the boxspring on the floor 
and i've got like comforters 
on the side of the bed 
so cause he's like 
he will like get out he's just like i don't wanna be in the bed with these guys and he will get on the floor and 
he will sleep on the comforters on the floor but he's close and 
he's happy that 
uhhum 
uhhum 
right there 
yeah that yeah 
uhhum 
i think the mother has more of an instinct for that 
but 
as far as the studies go where the people roll over their babies i don't see how you can roll over on 
anything that size and not know it 
unless you were on drugs or drunk or 
whatever 
you know what i mean 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
yeah because i couldn't imagine rolling over on 
anything that was foreign in my bed and not knowing it it would wake me up 
especially i mean i think you 
kind of have  
different 
level of awareness 
when you are a mother and you're sleeping in a bed with your 
infant 
because 
uhhum 
uhhum 
pretty well 
there 
i think it is harder on him because he is demanding of my attention 
and i think that's little harder because he was an only child for 
nearly five years 
so 
it's been an adjustment for him but he loves his baby brother 
it's it's really he he nurtures him too so 
it's neat to watch 
uhhum 
uhhum 
right and they're in so much competition 
uhhum 
well actually i've 
picked up a part time job just in the past month or two so 
i'm 
i'm working for a research firm 
just for the convenience of the hours i i want to get back into the nursing field but 
right now i just can't 
take that much time 
away 
because that would be least an eight hour shift and 
i 
don't 
think 
that we're ready for that 
he's a teacher 
uhhum 
he works at a high school yeah 
he teaches ninth and tenth graders 
no 
don't think that at all 
i'd be deceiving myself i think 
i i guess when i 
i heard about him i'm just like oh my gosh i can't believe 
all of the 
the things that these kids are experiencing i didn't 
know about 
whatever until i was much much older i didn't worry about that when i was that age and 
it's kind of scary 
i have no 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
yeah 
i guess my 
i guess what i would say 
mostly for that is that 
the parents are too busy with their own careers 
and they don't take time 
to raise their kids 
and establish the morals 
in the home 
and they're just like oh well they will learn it 
there 
whatever 
and the kids 
um 
they're 
basic 
where they learn things is their peers they don't get it 
everything instilled at home 
that's pretty much 
what 
you know i've 
seen talking to my husband and 
you know and there's so many broken homes and single moms and trying to 
trying to do it all and the kids are the ones that are suffering and having to 
grow up before they're ready 
uhhum 
uhhum 
but yeah 
uhhum 
yeah 
the media exposure 
i blame it on that yeah because you know 
there's been a lot more kids that have died in school 
then you know 
just recently i guess it wasn't in the biggin numbers at one time 
but there's been random 
violence in schools you know 
where kids would die even more than 
you know seven or whatever 
and i think that the media's just made it into something 
that they've glamorized it and some of the kids i think are screwed up anyway and they're just like well hey you know 
i can do that and i will be on the  yeah 
i do i think that's a big part of that 
because they want 
their name known and they don't care if they die anyway 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
yeah 
yeah 
it's been glamorized and they don't 
they don't value 
human life either 
i don't think because there's so much violence 
you know you can't 
watch tv and not seeing 
somebody get shot or something 
and it's just like it's not really real 
because it's you know you turn the channel and you see the same actor doing something else and you're like see it wasn't real and 
i don't think they 
i think 
i don't know 
uhhum uhhum 
uhhum 
yeah because they think they're grown 
they think they're grown and they're like 
twelve and thirteen and they've been having sex since they were ten and 
it's just 
and you know how and they're having babies earlier and earlier and 
it's just really 
scary 
i think it should be the parent's responsibility 
but i have no objection to them teaching it 
somewhat in the schools i guess 
uhhum 
i don't know that they  use the 
if they had it 
i i don't know 
uhhum 
uhhum 
i personally agree with that but that's just from my own moral beliefs and 
everything but i don't know 
i i don't think that there's one solution that will fit every 
every 
child and every situation 
i mean my husband had his daughter when he was seventeen so 
you know obviously his he said his dad told him about condoms you know so 
they're gonna make that decision on their own i say just 
and and plus with the internet and everything they 
they have access to so much information 
and i think that it falls back on the parents still 
if you're gonna be a parent you need to be 
and i don't think that 
it's getting done 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
i don't i don't think so 
but 
uhhum 
i doubt it 
i think he needs counseling 
that point 
hmm 
personally no i don't think so 
uhhum 
i had considered that yes 
i just 
actually i was going to send my son to a  kindergarten but i decided to home school instead so i've been home schooling him for kindergarten 
uhhum 
because i want his morals and  you know 
his 
basic stuff to come from me 
really 
yeah 
uhhum 
exactly i wish i would have taken typing and home ec in high school 
and i was too busy with college prep and 
you know what good did that do me 
i 
exactly 
uhhum 
life skills 
exactly 
everybody needs to know that 
information 
for credit cards 
yeah my husband was one of those 
we're still working those 
yeah 
and it stays with you for years 
they don't realize that nobody tells them until after the 
uhhum 
oh yeah 
i have no idea 
i i knew that kindergarten because it's 
it's not required in the state of ohio 
anyway they really aren't required to be 
in school or enrolled in anything until they're six by september 
when i found that out  was like oh ok cool 
you know  can keep them home i mean he's 
he could probably go into the second grade i mean 
he's 
very bright he can read and write and 
add and  he you know he's 
so it's a challenge for me 
oh yeah 
oh yeah 
we're crazy 
he's an educator which is all the more reason to 
because he sees it and he's like 
yeah they 
get it from us so 
i know 
exactly 
right 
i've seen some of the work from my husband's ninth and tenth graders because he's an english teacher 
and 
i was appalled 
because they were writing at like a fourth or fifth grade level and they're ninth and tenth graders 
and i mean  
just 
you know even their manuscript and you know just how they wrote and 
was like wow 
i couldn't believe it 
uhhum 
doesn't 
that's a bunch of  
that's just one of those myths 
i think that's 
to make people feel guilty or something 
but it's not gonna work 
i mean they 
if you're around 
people i mean number one they're around 
their parents and their siblings and that's socialization 
you go to 
church or to the library or wherever i mean you're around people and you're around 
children and they get to 
have socialization if you want to call it 
whatever 
and 
i think 
from everything that i've read and seen 
that um 
they get 
the socialization that they need at home and they're not relying so much on their peers and their peer's opinions 
because   for one example the pokemon 
craze 
my son didn't know what pokemon was until he heard some other kids talking about it 
and you know it's just like stuff like that 
it's just like they don't 
they don't know what 
half of that stuff is unless some other kid is pushing it in their face you know 
and then even still they're just like oh it's cool because everybody else likes it they don't really know what 
it is or what 
it's about or 
i mean 
you know what i mean because it's like 
now they just blow up each other or whatever it's like really what is the point to the whole thing and 
he didn't know what it was until he heard some other kids talking about it oh it must be cool because some other kids are talking about it but then he decided that it wasn't cool 
so that was my  our influence on him rather than the peer's influence on him 
uhhum 
right 
exactly 
yeah 
it is and it's not 
it's 
my house isn't as clean as i would like it to be but 
yeah 
but that's just one 
minor 
minor thing 
and i feel like i'm just in a 
kind of a  phase if you will 
it's you know because they will be grown up 
in a blink of an eye 
so if i 
i mean if i put my career or whatever on hold 
it's gonna be worth it in the long run 
when my kids 
are grown up 
and they could be like yeah mom was there 
they taught 
you know mom and dad taught us 
you know 
all of our life application skills that we need to know now 
and i think that 
that will be better in the long run for them 
and that's the responsibility i took on as being a parent so 
that's my job 
even though it is mundane and 
monotonous at 
yeah 
exactly 
oh you're just you're just a 
a homemaker 
what do you do sit on the couch and watch tv and eat bon bons all day you know it's kind of 
exactly 
that's the that's the idea that people get they don't 
i don't think they realize 
that how much 
it is 
yeah and it's a challenge living on one income 
that's why i've got a part time job now 
uhhum 
exactly 
uhhum 
uhhum 
they're 
i don't know that staying home is for everyone and i don't think parenting 
is for everyone 
and it really makes me sad when i see somebody 
you know 
well we just want our 
kids 
because they're only little once 
that's what i tell myself when i get really really frustrated 
they're only little once and they will be grown up before i know it 
yeah because i mean five years went by like 
yeah it was 
yeah because i don't have a degree 
i went back and did a one year 
um schooling  
get  
nursing license i became an l p n 
so 
i don't have a degree my husband has a degree i put him 
through school 
finished his private school 
wittenberg 
no 
eventually 
yeah 
we will see where i'm at in five years 
i know everybody is like well don't you want to go back for your r n i'm like 
after working with r n's and 
we were doing the same things basically and they didn't get paid much more than i did so i was like well what a waste you know 
go to school 
for nothing basically just to learn a few more theories 
just 
a little bit of both i think i 
looked into some phonics i went to the library checked out some phonic tapes let him watch those cause 
kids love to watch things 
and just reading with him and going over things and 
it's it's been amazing just to see it's like the light bulb comes on and 
yeah and he can sound out things and he can even spell things just from his own understanding of phonics and 
yeah 
i've i been pretty impressed i'm like wow you got that really really close to being the right spelling 
just from what he's learned 
well i mean most of it was me going over it with him 
and just 
you know i talked to some people and they recommended this and recommended that and then i looked at it and 
you know just 
doing the things that work for him and as an individual 
i'd say we do oh at least an hour 
or more a day 
something like that 
well i mean i wouldn't  i wouldn't say it was an hour at a time 
but yeah 
and he loves playing on the computer 
doing c d roms and 
loves watching the magic school bus 
so i 
i try to gear what he watches 
towards educational 
programming instead of just 
junk 
no 
well right now i think he knows enough i'm just letting him be creative he loves playing with his legos and building things i'm pretty i'm like wow i can't even build the stuff that he built he makes ships and cars and 
rockets an 
i'm  i'm impressed i'm like ok i tried to build a car and it didn't look 
yeah so 
ah 
probably 
yeah 
nah because right now 
you know because he knows how  he's he's learned 
i'd say he knows more than most kindergarteners 
so i don't even push anything we don't really have a set schedule right now and 
i'm just letting him be creative and 
you know letting him help around the house and 
you know just 
if i let him watch something thats educational 
based usually 
and i let him play on the computer 
we will go to different websites sometimes to 
check out things and 
i'm amazed sometimes at what he just catches on just from 
day to day 
stuff 
and just listening because he's 
he listens to 
he picks up toys he will vacuum he 
puts dishes in a dishwasher and 
he can 
um put clothes and take clothes out of a dryer and put clothes away 
yeah 
he cleans his 
he cleans the toilet too because he's a boy and boys 
even some men don't quite 
hit the mark sometimes so 
especially since most of that is his 
i would say ninety 
nine ninety eight percent 
because it's hard being the only girl in the 
his mom was june cleaver 
uhhum 
hum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
and then they end up okay anyway 
that's good 
right 
yeah 
he'd be lost 
uhhum 
at the age of ten 
i shouldn't be having to clean quite as much as 
do now 
ah mm i'd say by ten 
they should be able to help me prepare a meal or be able to pretty much do most of it by themself i know i did at then 
and to be able to do 
their laundry 
maybe 
definitely 
help out a lot around the house 
no thanks 
uhhum 
i don't think i can answer that 
on the spur of the moment 
i'd have to think about that i really would 
i'd 
yeah i would 
i'd say  you know life application 
things would definitely 
need to be part of it 
i don't think that you should throw out english or math or 
you know 
can't believe i'm saying this history but 
i don't think you should throw out that stuff but i don't think that there should be 
as much emphasis on it 
i think more of the  emphasis should be on 
life skills and just being able to make it 
on you're own and take care of yourself and 
but definitely i think that those other 

the three r's 
you know i think those are still very important 
because you do have to have a higher education 
most of the time to do anything 
these days so 
they definitely have to have their 
grounding at there so they can go forward 
i know i wish i knew how to sew 
i can do buttons that's about it 
uhhum 
yeah 
exactly 
uhhum 
i'd say there would be certain life 
application things that all kids should know 
but not 
i don't think that you can say everything 
you know you have 
everybody has do this because 
you know people are individuals and you have to take that in to consideration i think so 
uhhum 
uhhum 
that's good 
uhhum 
uhhum 
i don't know 
i don't know 
i'm sure it would happen because there's 
all kinds of wacky people out there 
seriously 
i don't know 
i have the family members that are homosexual that's just my own personal 
thing beliefs 
i don't know i think that's 
they shouldn't have taken it off of the 
d m s 
whatever it was 
i don't know 
uhhum 
uhhum 
somewhat 
uhhum 
yeah 
oh yeah 
so he's gonna be  can complain about something 
well that's another thing where you have to take the individuality into account because not everybody likes to cook 
you know  
most people know how to open a can of soup or something and boil water 
make some toast but 
you know that's about 
all that they wanna do as far as it comes to cooking even if they do have to cook for their family not everybody 
not every female likes to cook you know they just do it because 
you know they're supposed to or whatever and 
i know some families where the men 
the  the husband does all of the grocery shopping and all the cooking 
and the wife does you know whatever she does 
i mean it 
it's individuality 
again 
so 
yeah my dad's a chauvinist pig 
is 
no 
um probably not 
he thought it was great that i was going to school but 
but then he disowned me so it doesn't 
mm 
yeah 
and i do have a brother 
by the way 
he didn't 
he works in a factory 
oh 
well um 
i  i suppose 
well i've 
i 
decided that i was going to date a black guy and my  my dad didn't like that at all so he disowned me and 
so now  i'm married to my husband and 
my husband is black 
and 
and 
exactly 
because not only is he a chauvinist pig but he's a bigot 
a racist  so 
uhhum 
uhhum 
really 
i didn't know that 
okay 
uhhuh 
uhhum 
diversity 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
yeah because it's the midwest yeah 
that's cool 
never 
no 
he doesn't have anything 
he  he won't 
talk to me 
yet 
it is and it isn't because i 
i  where he is and he's 
really messed up and 
i 
i can't do anything for him 
but i've you know i've 
i'm open to 
a relationship with him 
but right now 
with his attitude the way it is i'd say that 
me and my family are better off not having him 
stirring up a bunch of 
conflict or whatever 
so 
he's saw he's seen my oldest son when he was like two i was at my cousin's wedding 
my cousin invited me to his wedding and me and my son went that was before me and my husband got married that's another long story 
he was three when we got married 
and um 
my  
my dad threw fit 
yeah 
like a little kid 
and 
really he he didn't say anything to me but he made my aunt feel like a little 
pile of dirt 
his sister 
and uh 
so he just really 
showed out that day 
but what's so funny is 
our baby 
my dad has red hair 
and our baby 
has red hair 
so and he 
and he looks uh he looks more you know like 
that side of the family 
and 
i was  
he he was born we couldn't believe it we didn't know there was redheads on my husband's side of the family 
and then we found out that he had a great grandfather with red hair and blue eyes 
that's my dad has red hair and blue eyes so 
it's just very comical i was just like uh-oh 
i said well god has a sense of 
what i said so 
don't think the saga's over 
uhhum 
uhhuh 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
yeah 
um yeah 
right um 
and it's sometimes that  um 
the person up because 
a child they're so innocent and you can't help but love them 
and 
i know my mom had a big problem 
with 
the whole inter racial 
thing at first but 
she 
my  she loves my kids 
and she loves my husband 
now 
and it was just taking her out of her 
you know where she 
you know you you grow up hearing those lies and 
you know it just experiencing 
someone for who they are 
and so she's 
uh she's grown uh uh she yeah 
she's expanded her horizons if you will 
and 
yeah 
no 
no they they divorced when i was like ten or something so 
i would say yes and no i've uh i've uh i feel pretty accepted 
and 
you know 
just sometimes it's just like they're like oh well she couldn't understand or something like that but 
for the most part i 
there's 
you know no weirdness 
he's had he had a few cousins you know make some little 
comments but 
no nothing i mean his mom and his dad are cool and 
his brother and sister 
they're fine 
uh no 
no 
my dad's the only 
weird well 
him and some of his brothers and sisters are 
kind of out there too but 
uhhum 
uhhum 
em oh yeah 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
yeah um 
yeah 
uhhum 
right 
that's good 
yeah 
uhhum 
uhhum 
eh 
as much probably 
no the funniest thing though was with my husband and the 
because he's so  
he's so fair 
and he said in the hospital people were looking at him like 
there's no way that could happen 
he said that because you know they take them off to  
weigh him or whatever and i said you don't leave him 
he said people were looking at him like 
who who 
you know 
somebody lied to you buddy he said they were just looking at him like 
you know no way 
they were like 
no 
but 
ah okay 
uhhum 
uhhum 
oh yeah 
uhhum 
okay 

uhhum 
yeah i just wear my glasses for 
more for 
you know 
reading 
i can see far away 
i wish i could wear contacts 
no 
because i have a stigmatism 
because i 
you know look 
glasses cut in right here and that's irritating 
all right 
i wasn't born here but i was raised here 
and i was raised here most of my life 
i was a baby 
you know 
under one 
i was born in brooklyn new york 
that's where my father's from 
my father moved here yes 
with my mother 
uhhum 
well um 
my uh grandmother 
was uh 
ill 
my mother's mother 
and her sister 
would be my aunt she was uh care taking 
so my mother came here 
for that reason 
and they just stayed 
yeah they like they really like this town 
she was from 
kentucky 
appalachia 
he was from brooklyn 
and uh 
you know i guess it worked for them 
uh huh 
right 
and not the 
you know  that went on in 
you know in new york the 
fast pace 
yes i do 
about i try to visit at least uh 
at least two every two years 
we 
either we go to new york or we meet half way 
years ago we met at penn state 
and uh 
so 
you know the older ones are all dying off though so 
and  you know people don't have big families like they used to you know so 
kind of dwindling 
yes i do 
i have a brother and two sisters 
yeah 
well 
you know 
i'm the oldest 
we're all in columbus 
uhhum 
i don't know what it's like to grow up uh anywhere else  uh i know what it's like 
uh 
kind of like where my cousin lived in new york because i'd go there 
in the summers 
but uh 
hum did i like growing up in 
uh how do you  judge that you know 
what do you compare that to 
i think that uh  
yeah it would have been better for me if we had lived in new york
yes 
um 
well because my 
cousins and uh 
uh they all have uh 
they're very  
you know well educated 
they're more affluent 
and i think that uh 
maybe there would have been more opportunity for my dad there 
uh he was a uh 
railroad clerk 
yeah 
yeah 
he um 
traced freight whatever that means 
where the 
where they were going and 
and uh 
he worked in a trailer 
uh 
out in the yards 
you know 
yeah 
yeah 
he so uh 
yeah he was strictly a union man 
you know 
so 
he kept his 
he believed in the unions 
you know 
so the railroaders was union you know 
he always preached get a union job you know 
course they don't believe in the unions now like they used to 
you know 
we really don't know much about his life away  
you know 
away from home 
as far as what he did i 
i'm sure that he probably did go to meetings 
but uh as far as being a leader or something like that he i know i don't 
i'm sure he wasn't 
no 
he didn't 
he didn't 
we didn't 
know 
you know anything about what he did or 
we found out more um after he died 
twenty years ago 
when he died 
um 
i was about thirty 
he was only fifty six 
uh he had an aneurism 
he had uh 
high blood pressure 
which we knew about 
and uh 
he started um 
you know not being himself so he went to the doctor and they 
did some tests and found out he had this aneurism that had to be operated on right away 
and he died uh 
under the anesthetic of a heart attack 
um so 
it was very sudden and 
unexpected 
uhhum 
right 
right 
uhhum 
yeah 
no 
i ended up uh 
running away from home 
yeah 
i was a teenage run away 
no there was a lot of conflict at home 
um 
my dad uh 
had to support us uh there were four of us and our mother has disabilities 
and uh she was kind of 
crazy 
you know not 
that i'm 
talking negative about my mother 
but she has um 
some uh 
neurological damage 
and uh 
a disease 
that affected her mind 
and of course you know back then i didn't really 
know that but 
there was a lot of conflict 
um 
so uh 
that's what i did and i 
went to some uh 
foster homes and things like that 
and uh 
lived in delaware for a while 
you know got out of highschool and 
got married 
right 
uhhum 
i never went back home 
yeah i did 
uhhum 
when i would run away from foster homes 
yeah i did 
that was that was horrible 
yeah there was a lot of them and they were not very good 
yeah right here in columbus 
in the short north 
not too far from here 
uhhum 
well that used to be where 
you know all the teenage teenagers went 
i don't know if they still do 
that was a long time ago 
that's always kind of been known for that 
you know 
yeah 
they go 
yeah 
yeah i don't know where they're going now but 
i 
tried 
volunteering 
you know at  
picking them up 
doing a volunteer thing and i'd get calls all during the night to go pick these kids up 
because i thought i was doing something to help but 
you know 
you're not helping them 
this  
these 
this 
these uh the  it has uh setup where um 
they have safe places where kids can go when they run away 

and then 
it's different businesses like white castle  
pizza 
one of the pizza places and 
uh 
some of the supermarkets and things and they're advertised you know 
throughout the community 
so these kids when they have problems they 
might wanna go to huckleberry house and they don't have a way so they go to a safe house 
and they call and they have a 
you know group of volunteers would go out and pick these kids up 
take them to huckleberry house 
which isn't far from here 
so i did that for a while but uh 
wasn't very uh 
satisfying 
because i really didn't feel like they were doing anything to really help the kids 
at huckleberry house 
well they only keep them there like for you know a day or so 
and then they um 
try to 
intervene with their family 
put them back with their family 
or um 
maybe call in children's sevices and i 
and i just really don't think much of children's services so 
you know i just got out of it 
uhhum 
no 
with the system 
well 
i think they need to do away with a lot of the foster homes 
uh 
uh you know a lot of the  you know there's 
people with good intentions but 
i just think that it just needs to be restructured totally different way 
and uh 
you know maybe pull these kids uh 
into more of a group 
setting or something and give them more um 
you know counseling uh professional 
you know counseling 
because it's um 
you know i i didn't have good experiences with 
foster homes and 
and i know of a lot of kids 
you know they're saying that 
i think the parents have too many 
rights 
you know in the courts 
and there's just a lot going on you know that 
uh 
it's not gonna get better it's gonna get worse you know with the way families are torn apart now 
and uh 
you know 
mothers have to work and 
uh 
you just can't you know stay home and be that uh 
you know perfect mom 
you know 
so there's just a lot going on 
uh 
that needs to be restructured 
so 
the runaways 
uh well 
i think the youngest that i met was maybe  
but that's you know still young 
i picked up one kid he 
he had been in uh 
he was only about 
fifteen 
he was adopted 
and he ran away 
he was having problems with his adopted mother 
and he was in a 
an all 
all night restaurant 
and he was bragging you know that he met this man 
and the man took him home 
you know and he slept at the man's place 
and i was telling her do you know how dangerous that you know that could have been for you 
and uh 
he thought it was cool 
you know 
so you know just things like that 
he was lucky 
yeah 
he was lucky 
so 
excuse me 
well 
typically what i observed is conflict you know with mom 
most of the time 
uh 
well i think a lot of times when there's a stepfather involved you know that becomes a problem for some of them 
but 
they said 
you know you might run into a case where you know the family's abusing 
uh 
the child 
you know but i didn't run into that 
really 
yeah 
uhhum 
yeah go in there and find out you know is the kid being abused if the kids being abused 
you know take him out 
you know forget the parents rights 
you know 
or um 
yeah you know if they're using drugs put them somewhere you know 
and get them you know get them 
in rehab you know keep them there 
you know just don't 
throw them there for three days and then throw them out 
it's a lot of money being wasted on these kids being placed in these foster homes 
where nothing's getting accomplished 
in a way yeah i think that would be good 
yeah 
maybe a new name 
yeah 
uhhum 
yeah they had those back when i was a teen they wanted to send me to one of those 
my father wouldn't allow it 
because uh 
it was 
integrated 
um hum 
the court 
i had a social worker 
uhhum 
hum i had a social worker um 
you know the whole time 
they might 
you know do things different now though but 
you're supposed to have a caseworker 
i moved to louisville kentucky 
i had one 
while i was there yeah 
i have two kids 
twenty nine and twenty two 
they're real good 
uhhum 
well my twenty nine year old she's married 
and uh 
she has a child 
and she's  she's expecting another one 
she's a senior here at um 
o s u 
she will be graduating 
in june 
and uh 
she's worked you know really hard 
and my son he's uh 
he's a senior he's twenty two he's a senior here 
uh 
don't think he's gonna graduate in two thousand 
because he's a new senior 
he wants to go to law school 
he does uh real well in school 
he's uh 
like a honor honor honorary thing you know 
but that's all um 
you know on him he did it 
you know 
no 
uh uh 
not at all 
he's always had very definite opinions of how his life should be 
okay 
and always uh made choices for himself 
but 
as far as motivated uh for school no 
he was always motivated toward a career 
yeah he grew up here 
uhhum 
yeah he went to columbus public schools well 
you know i or 
i'm 
catholic and i went 
to catholic schools and so i tried that with both my kids catholic schools and um 
for couple years and 
so he was in uh catholic school a couple years but he got he got expelled 
because he's uh 
a d h d 
okay 
so 
uh he got expelled from 
catholic school for 
behavior 
problems 
no that's 
no that's one thing that uh you know i found was really lacking here 
um 
for my son 
uh 

nobody ever 
you know what they wanted me do was 
put him on ritalin 
and i didn't like him on ritalin i didn't like what it did to him 
uh it turned him into a zombie 
yeah i 
i mean i'm used to those uh boy like you know 
jumping all over the house and 
uh 
you know just always just 
active 
and he's always been very active in sports 
but when i put him on the ritalin he was um 
laying on the couch you know just 
zombied out 
yeah 
i didn't know you know what the problem was and 
you know i just kept having these problems with him so they told me i need take him the school said i need take him psychiatrist psychologist 
and uh so i took him and 
she said do you think this is normal 
you know because he's like 
rolling off the  and 
banging dolls together i  i don't know i said i got one brother 
i don't know how boys are supposed to be 
she says well this is not normal 
i'm like okay 
so uh 
i don't know i tried taking him to um 
psychologists 
they did like behavioral 
therapy 
i brought him here to ohio state and put him in a 
an experiment 
uh he was in it for about three years 
working with a food supplement 
and uh 
it actually did 
real well for him 
and the researcher   what he you know   like sort of like taking vitamins 
he gave  supplies of that even 
after the 
project was over 
but then after there wasn't any more he couldn't give it to me and it cost too much 
for me to buy it 
i've never heard of it 
being developed commercially 
so 
uh 
he finally decided uh 
you know after 
oh well when he was in catholic school they kept his 
kept his 
desk in the hallway 
you know 
yeah they'd just kick him to the hallway he was either 
you know 
in the hallway or in 
uh 
the office and and the nuns would say oh we love him to come here because he can answer all our trivia questions 
that was grade school 
you know the only thing that really really saved my son i think from getting into any kind of trouble or anything was he was so involved in sports 
uhhum 
so when he uh was a junior then he started in high school he started really seriously thinking i gotta get it together what am i gonna do 
so he uh 
agreed to go to psychiatrist and uh 
so he went on ritalin 
uh 
so he took the ritalin through his 
last 
of his junior year and his senior year 
now he's on a medication they call uh wellbutrin 
his doctor um 
doesn't believe in 
ritalin 
so 
he gives him a drug called wellbutrin 
which is a 
you know 
like an antidepressant type thing that they said works for uh 
a d h d 
but it really helped him you know concentrate 
to be able to 
study 
oh yeah 
uhhum 
yeah he's got energy 
yeah 
i'm 
saying that it's not right for some people but 
you know wasn't right for my son 
it is 
yeah 
because pediatricians are able to dispense it and 
um 
i just 
you know felt like 
trying to avoid it as much as possible you know growing up 
see that's that's the difference uh worthington has a 
you know program for them um 
one of the women that i worked with 
she was having so many problems similar to mine 
and her  son was in um columbus schools and 
she moved to westerville and 
put him in this class for that and 
it took care of it 
they don't have that 
for 
columbus schools 
i don't have a good opinion of 
uh columbus schools 
at all 
no not at all 
no i i i don't think so 
well it's gotta come from the top 
you know i 
i just found like there was just a total lack of interest in the student 
from every direction 
so i would say you know it's an organizational 
problem with no you know no motivation 
uh 
you know to do their job 
you know properly 
now 
i live down the street from what they call c a h s  it's the columbus uh alternative 
high school 
and uh you get there through a lottery system 
and they have the best reputation of all the columbus schools 
and uh those kids leave there getting full scholarships 
uh my son went there one year 
uh 
uh 
it was a disaster for him 
but you know 
it's a very  
and nonstructured environment 
which 
my son wouldn't have worked 
in and then they don't have sports but 
these kids get 
scholarships to some of the major colleges throughout the united states and we're talking big money  full scholarships 
so if they're able to do it there at that one school 
you know they could 
they could do it 
my 
granddaughter my one granddaughter 
uh 
they live in springfield they just moved to springfield and she goes to 
kindergarten 
only a half day 
and this child is only uh five years old 
uh he has them reading the newspaper 
watching the news 
she told me a story about 
christopher columbus um discovering america that was so 
deep and intense 
couldn't believe it was coming from a five year old 
so this is what the teacher is doing down there 
and she wouldn't have learned that a whole day kindergarten here 
well i would say in springfield yeah 
i can't say you know i cant say that it's an  
expectation i i still say it has to come from the top down 
uh 
you've gotta have the leadership 
uh you've gotta have the right people 
uh 
to have this 
school structured 
properly 
and the you know the people with the right credentials 
uh for the job 
you know 
and uh 
i'm telling you 
some of these principals 
that 
uh 
that i've dealt with 
uh were highly overpaid 
as far as i was concerned for what they were doing 
um 
you know one  
one principal that 
from my um daughter's high school 
he was out partying all the time they 
you know they 
he was  he was riding around in a corvette 
and uh he tried to take me out 
and he was always like really red faced and the kids would say you know he went out at lunch and got drunk and came back 
and that was one of the better schools 
in columbus 
and 
you know i just saw a lot of that i just saw a lot of um 
uh principals driving big fabulous cars and 
not doing anything 
my 
son uh 
you know with his disorder 
he would constantly be uh 
late 
for school 
and i uh 
called the school 
and told them 
this was in high school 
that i wanted them to file charges on him 
and 
they said well no uh 
he's not 
met the criteria 
i said well he doesn't get to school sometimes until lunchtime 
they said well he gets here just 
in time 
to not be counted 
um 
tardy or not tardy but 
absent for the whole day 
which would  be considered truant 
so they said i well i had to do was go down to juvenile 
to this certain gentleman 
in juvenile and have him file charges 
so i took my son down to him 
and he said 
it was the school 
should have did that 
so in the meantime he's telling me 
that my son's in getting ready to go eleventh grade 
and 
neither side's gonna do anything about it 
somebody should've did something about that because 
then you know they would have been doing what they were supposed to do to 
make him 
you know 
get in line 
and uh 
so he knew he could get by with it 
he 
that's goes with the disorder they know 
they know 
when 
who's button to push and when not to push a button and how far they can go and 
you know where the line is and they 
push you 
always 
that's why teachers 
they uh they drive the teacher up the wall 
you know 
my daughter you know there was just a lot of stuff when she was in high school and i'd call up to the school and 
you know the principal like 
he's he'd say miss  you know i'm 
i am her 
last chance 
you know 
my daughter was going to summer school 
every summer 
and he's like mrs  you know 
she's like 
you know 
the average student 
uh 
she's the type you know that she's gonna get 
you know she's got gonna get through college you know she's just one of those 
you know that just moves right along you know she's not the brightest you know but 
she's bright enough and 
those are your average professional people out working today 
and i was just like well i just want more help for my daughter you know i just want 
somebody to 
you know jerk her down 
but they wouldn't you know because my daughter was like um 
real bubbly outgoing 
you know people person 
and she got by with so much 
at school 
and she's you know worked it's worked out fine with her 
with both of them actually 
well her major is communications 
it didn't start out that but 
my daughter wants to write books 
okay 
well 
in the meantime you know 
you gotta pay the bills 
so 
i you know i'm not sure what she wants to do 
she's had so many different kinds of jobs part time jobs though 
hum 
you know 
i'm 
when she was younger like ten years ago she wanted to have her own talk show 
yeah 
so 
i don't know she's getting a second child now it's getting a little harder 
you know 
i do hope that she does she is a good writer 
i do hope that  you know someday she can 
be able to do that 
yeah 
she just likes to write stories and she's real creative that way 
and the baby is due may thirtieth and graduation is june second 
so however this works out you know 
i don't know i'm just i'm just 
like okay 
she just does i just want to get it over with 
and see now she you know 
yeah 
she just wants to get it over with 
yeah 
so 
she said she's gonna be catching the disability bus out here you know after a certain amount of time 
she's gonna ride that bus 
is it 
oh that's a good day 
yeah 
course you know babies tend not to be on 
on time so 
yeah 
my kids were both two 
two weeks late so i know how it is 
yeah 
it's it's interesting too because when she had her other child 
uh 
her she had made arrange she was at uh otterbein then 
she made arrangements that uh 
she might have to be in the hospital taking a final 
with one of her teachers 
so that baby was born in march 
so 
i think she got the finals right in or  you know 
it's just too much stress for me to even think about 
so that's why she's trying to get it out of the way now because you know the 
the 
the husband he makes 
you know fairly decent money 
so 
you know she doesn't have to work right now 
but in order for them to move up the way they want to move up you know 
after the baby comes she will need to work 
i have custody of another grandchild 
uh my son 
when he was in high school had a 
girl 
no a little girlfriend and 
she was uh 
see he was tenth grade and she was ninth grade i guess 
she uh 
had a baby 
and uh 
believe my son was in eleventh grade when the baby was born 
and uh she had a lot of problems running away from home and 
uh 
she's uh 
you know well my son left to move into the dorm 
here at o s u 
and she uh 
moved in with me i think the baby was fifteen months old and 
i tried to help the young lady and 
it just turned out that the you know the young lady was not ready to be a mother 
my son wouldn't 
even now isn't ready to be a father 
so uh 
there was a 
you know whole investigation 
through childrens services 
and uh 
they gave me custody of the child 
temporarily 
and 
she's still there and she's four and a half 
the mother's married 
and has another child now and and the 
the little one's still with me 
she hasn't tried to get her daughter back 
she has 
visitation with her 
i love her very very much you know that way emotionally but 
boy i'd like for her mom to take her back 
yeah 
you know i'm fortunate because i got a grant for her through the 
y uh m c a 
at a very nice um 
learning center 
that she goes to everyday 
so 
you know course a lot of that you know hinges on the fact that my son is a student and they're very pro education you know 
so my son he's back home now but i wish he would go too 
he just joined this fraternity 
oh my gosh 
it was a 
it was it was just 
unbelievable 
he got really sick after that rush week 
yeah really sick 
so they want him to move in the fraternity house he can't really afford it 
but they just sent me a really nice letter saying he's like in the top of their chapter academically and everything so 
i'm thinking they might help him out a little bit they want him in the house real bad 
yeah 
yeah 
i i was really glad that my son uh met you know was introduced to them or brought in or whatever they do because 
uh 
you know the guys are real real nice 
you know 
very 
it's very you know he's always kind of been like real stand off ish 
when it comes to 

you know hooking up real tight with guys but he really likes these guys 
well 
um 
see he 
moved into an apartment over on eleventh avenue 
and it got broken into 
and uh 
you know 
he's paying rent on this apartment and he's back home 
because the police said that this 
apartment has been hit 
many times 
so it's just a big mess right now you know 
had uh 
uh 
nice uh  you know his better clothes stolen his jewel 
you know 
jewelry 
um few other 
minor things but he didn't want his tv and v c r and 
those kind of things to get stolen so he moved them back home and 
then he started worrying about something else and that moves back 
then he's worried about his car because somebody down the street got their car stolen 
so it's just uh gonna be a matter  rearranging 
he's 
um 
applying for another scholarship he gets some already 
so if he would get this other scholarship i think it uh would help him uh 
be able to 
move into the fraternity 
uh i think he can get out of the apartment by  
subleasing it 
he has to get the seventy five dollars to give to the landlord to 
they charge seventy five to do that 
to 
advertise 
and um 
screen 
you know do the screening 
yeah 
oh 
boy they're just really fun people to deal with
they had a two by four on the door 
for over a month 
nailed over it 
instead of 
replacing the door 
so 
yeah 
company and they they uh 
they're the biggest landlord on campus i believe 
yeah 
so you know his friend lives on the other side you know it's like a duplex and his friend lived on the other side and he uh 
he also was uh 
broken into 
they 
came through his bathroom window 
you know the police said that they've been there many times 
you know but 
you know kids they have to learn these things on their own i mean he's twenty two i still consider him a kid 
but 
they have to learn these things on their own you know when you go to look for apartment what you need to look for and what you need to check out 
you know 
are you going to be able to afford it and 
everything that goes with it 
and have a work study job 
you know 
uhhum 
he wants to yeah 
yeah 
well he thinks he can do it 
yeah 
yeah 
it's a lot of money 
but my son he just he's so uh 
i mean i don't know if 
you've ever met anybody that's totally into politics 
have you ever met somebody like that and 
yeah 
he's like that 
uh 
he wanted to 
but uh 
something in his schedule interfered with it 
uhhum 
yeah i've  i  think because my dad was 
no i don't work 
for politics 
no 
no i'm i'm interested 
yeah what goes on in the community 
uh 
goes on uh  you know nationally 
you know 
especially interested in this presidential 
election 
well i thought it went the way it was supposed to go 
yeah 
yeah uh somebody's gotta get 
k get 
you know 
put george bush to the back 
i'm an independent 
i 
i don't like w 
i i don't i don't 
i mean i 
my uh i guess 
my uh 
mom was a democrat and my dad was a republican 
and uh 
maybe that's why you know it's like that but 
historically you know my dad's people 
were democrats 
but then they turned republican because they thought they were supposed to turn republican i guess 
but uh 
you know there's there's some of 
the conservative values that are very important to me you know but then there's some social things that are real important too so 
uhhum 
and some 
conservative 
values too you know that the republicans are supposed to 
represent but i don't think they 
they are doing a very good job of that 
you can be an independent 
yeah 
but i've  
i've never voted in the primary my son said that uh 
i need to but 
i'm not real interested in voting in the primary 
yeah i could 
have you ever heard him speak 
he's like this robot 
you know 
every time you they ask him a question it's like it's been scripted and 
it's over and over 
and um 
he doesn't seem like he's real bright 
and i 
i really feel like if you're gonna run for president of the united states you ought to be smart 
really smart 
bill clinton is smart and i 
i don't like clinton but he's really smart 
and gore seems to be really smart 
bradley seems to be smart 
and mccain maybe maybe not so smart but 
he's smart enough 
he's 
exper 
experienced politician too 
but uh 
you know gore you just kind of look at that and say well uh 
you know the republicans are desperate you know 
yeah 
yeah 
so they knew that this bush 
name would bring out a lot of money 
which it has 
he's got a lot of money to work with 
and you know that doesn't seem fair either 
i don't think you know the average 
person in 
united states the average person 
uh doesn't think that your politicians should be bought 
you know 
not necessarily 
but you know i'd like him to 
beat a candidate 
right 
anything anybody but that bush 
and i sure don't want to vote for al gore 
you know it's terrible 
you don't have too many options you know 
yeah 
yeah 
they say it's gonna be hard to do in some of the other states but i don't think so 
against him in a lot of ways 
uh 
well my son he worked on the coleman campaign 
so of course uh you know i had to get out and you know help him put the signs out and all that kind of stuff i got the bumper sticker 
got some people in my family some bumper stickers neighbor 

but um 
i was 
i 
i was interested in uh seeing 
uh coleman be elected yes 
because 
uh  
she's a republican 
uh i used to work with  
not directly but indirectly so 
i 
certainly didn't want  to be elected 
she was the rudest woman 
yeah i would she was like a 
uh 
community 
liaison 
uh with our corporation 
so 
i was a supervisor 
on my job and sometimes i would have very very 
difficult 
uh 
clients 
that i need advice 
from her on how to 
you know go about 
working with them 
and um 
i would call her and she would um 
uh just be really rude 
not helpful 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum well you you had a  had a good reason be bothered 
uh coleman you know he had a good uh record 
you know on the council and that kind of thing so 
you know 
he's democrat 
you know like you know i said well ok you know 
give him a shot anything but  
because i thought you know basically the city's been ran pretty well 
basically 
you know as far as cities are 
right 
the mall issue 
well 
i felt that uh 
you know 
polaris 
mall would be good 
for the city 
uh even though i wanted 
you know  
northland mall 
to stay there that a seemed to be the big issue you know with 
northland mall 
but uh 
you know i knew that uh 
they'd already made that promise 
and there's a lot of 
businesses 
that could move out of that area 
you know and half those taxes come to columbus 
even if a business is in westerville 
half the  
the employees tax are going to um 
westerville and half are coming columbus 
yeah 
um 
you know i felt like you know 
the polaris mall 
would 
benefit 
columbus 
and um 
all all the way around you know 
uh as far as uh 
you know what was going on with that jacobs coming here and running all that advertising about northland mall and everything 
um 
i can understand you know the residents of northland 
uh 
wanting their mall to remain but i didn't feel like you know that had anything do with polaris being built 
see i live close to 
uh 
that would be the closest mall to me is northland 
it's convenient for me 
but uh 
then there's a lot 
you know that they could do with that mall too 
that 
might make me even  wanna go there more 
if they 
oh it has you know your basic uh 
lazarus 
which i like to go to lazarus and sears 
and j c penny's 
and uh 
no i wouldn't want to drive to polaris to go to those stores 
but if they made some outlets over there 
you know 
that i'd 
be happy with that 
uh there's just a lot of smaller 
stores you know like victoria secrets and 
bookstores and toy stores and 
athletic wear 
stores 
um 
lot those i don't even go to 
got some kiosks set up outside 
you know with 
little the little carts with different little things they sell 
just like your basic kind of mall 
i don't go to city center too much 
although i like it being there if i want to go to it 
yeah 
yeah because the traffic 
but see where i live i could get on the bus if i  
just wanted to go downtown 
real bad 
yeah 
yeah 
stops in front of my house 
yeah 
i like that 
and do like that 
i don't get on it but i mean it's there 
you know 
it's been good for my son 
uh being here at the 
university 
well he uses it when he has like car problems or something he tends to like to drive his own car 
do you know they have to park so far away 
uhhuh 
uhhuh 
yeah 
i don't know what he  pays but i know that he parks clear out over off of 
olentangy river road and 
has to take like a bus in 
uhhum 
uhhuh 
yeah 
so that's where he's always parked 
which made a little inconvenient when he lived in the uh 
the twin towers 
in the dorm 
because if i needed him to come home or something you know well i don't know 
i gotta get it 
get to my car 
some kind of way you know 
where i live now 
i've lived there for eleven years 
yeah quite a bit 
yeah i've seen columbus grow 
from 
the 
for 
from the time i've 
you know lived here as a child 
you know 
uh 
one sixty one 
you know dublin granville road 
you know i can remember when that was all country 
you know and when i came back here 
i i'd moved 
uh 
to kentucky i came back here um 
i'd say  uh nineteen seventy three 
one sixty one 
was like 
you know all new 
and this a place i wanna live you know 
all the cool apartments are on one sixty one all the great restaurants and everything 
so that's where i lived 
uh 
you know now that's just like they consider that like 
urban 
an urban area 
yeah i i 
i loved 
one sixty one i loved around there i loved all those cool restaurants and everything 
well 
it's not that there's been too much growth i mean growth is good 
but now they need to stop 
and come back in 
because see this is a great area around here to live 
and people 
you know 
like in clintonville realize that but then when get 
a little more over where i am 
my daughter was horrified 
you know that i wanted to buy a house over there 
but i was single 
you know 
with limited money 
and i live in a nice neighborhood i've lived there for eleven years 
i've never had 
any trouble 
whatsoever 
and uh 
the bus is right there and 
you know the only thing that bothers me is if i wanna 
you know go to a grocery store gotta go 
you know over to 
high street 
you know to clintonville 
you know to the big bear 
or i gotta drive 
you know further north 
so there's not any like really good businesses right around where i live that's the only thing 
so i think they need to come in 
you know redo 
you know get the 
downtown going 
when i was a kid i loved to go downtown 
you know that was like 
the coolest 
we would uh ride the bus 
we lived uh 
right around here on sixteenth avenue 

uh 
we would ride 
uh 
the bus downtown 
all the major 
uh stores were down there 
um 
uh there was a restaurant called mill's restaurant 
uh 
you know was all 
you know 
glass you could see through there there were different 
uh levels 
uh it 
white table clothes 
you know white napkins 
and 
you know we'd go there for lunch you know you dress 
nice and 
uh 
you know i 
i like 
that 
and i would uh 
like 
you know 
my grand kids to be able 
to go downtown with me like that you know 
rather than have to drive off to a mall 
yeah i think they're trying to do more 
i'm hoping they will 
you know crime is a lot worse now you know 
on the streets than it used to be 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah you know like when i worked in westerville 
i had bought my house because i used to live 
work um 
off of east north broadway and the freeway 
and uh 
i thought i was gonna be there forever 
so i bought my house you know where i only had drive two blocks but 
then i had to move to westerville 
and uh 
one my jobs there was i was a hiring um 
supervisor for department 
and we had about a hundred and 
fifty 
people in the department and it was growing 
and uh i wanted to hire uh 
minorities 
and uh 
it was very for some of the younger people and students 
uh to get up there because of transportation 
issues 
so um 
you know that's one thing that 
that i hope that they they work on 
yeah 
yes i did 
not for the uh 
the train 
the rail service no 
i just didn't see where it  
would be used utilized here 
right 
expanded bus service 
okay 
it's very informal here so 
i don't know  what we're doing but 

um 
yeah i just realized that like 
i don't know 
it's just different then i thought so 
if like i'm 
not happy in a place like i shouldn't stay and just be miserable about it 
yeah i thought it was gonna be 
like 
not so structured 
but it really is 
and like 
especially i mean it 
i know it's like all first year classes are basically the same 
and it's just kind of like how 
i don't know 
i thought it would be 
different like more of a 
like more of an adult type thing when really it's just they treat you the exact same way 
like i don't know 
yeah 
i think that's true and like i lived in the dorms too and i really i really didn't like that like 
it was like i don't know it was like 
living in a hotel or something it was really weird 
and like 
like just like 
like 
communal showers and stuff and like 
um 
just how it's like 
one room that you like 
kind of live in or whatever you know it's more like like the army or something you know like real 
everything's real simple and everything's uniform and like 
i don't know 
yeah 
uhhum 
yeah well it was like i kind of just like stopped going to class and 
and like 
and then i just like ended up withdrawing because i would have like failed everything anyways but 
um 
yeah then i was living with my friend 
for awhile 
but 
and then like 
now me and her and 
my other friend live in 
down on maynard 
uhhum 
yeah like i knew 
uh like a lot of people 
who live down on campus i used to live down on hudson 
like over the summer before i went to o s u 
um 
so i mean i like campus and everything it's just like 
o s u is different than campus 
yeah 
no about 
about same age 
well my one friend went to 
school in philadelphia for a while 
but she didn't 
she went to a 
like a 
university arts which is a 
like a theater 
school and uh 
it was real uh 
like intense or whatever you know it's like double the 
the 
workload of 
of a 
normal college 
so she didn't like that so she came back and was kind of in the  same situation that i was like 
not really knowing what to do or whatever 
and then 
my one friend 
who we're living with like he 
he 
he goes here he likes it i guess 
like 
i don't know 
first year yeah 
second quarter 
uhhum 
yeah 
yeah 
well like 
um 
i 
i knew 
one of my friends from sunbury 
was 
uh because kat does a lot of acting stuff and like 
um 
my one friend uh 
knew 
knew her like they did plays together like down at like columbus junior theater or something and like that's 
so like 
um 
that's how we got introduced or whatever and then just been friends for a while 
couple a 
couple years 
yeah 
yeah well like 
i mean high school high 
school's always been really easy and like 
and 
like high school's really easy like i never really felt like 
challenged even remotely by anything 
like 
and so like 
high school's kind of like a joke and it was real 
fun and everything you know just to like 
not really have to do pretty much of anything you know 
and like 
um 
and like so college was a 
a little bit different i mean it was like a little bit more challenging i mean it's basically the same thing in high school you just have less time to do the material you know 
so it's just like 
as opposed to having 
three weeks to doing a paper and doing it the night before you have three days to do it and you still do it the night before 
it's just like 
i don't know 
i 
thought 
i just kind of like found out like that 
i really don't like school and like ever wanna go back and like having to take 
having to take math 
again like i just was 
like 
isn't really my 
thing like when 
too like 
i 
always knew that this it would be like this you always have to take basic classes but like i was a history major 
and so 
it's like 
i don't care about math at all and like 
anything that i would do would be humanities or like 
so it's like 
like 
yeah well like i i played music and stuff 
with a lot of my friends i don't know basically just like 
standard teenage 
stuff sitting around watching tv 
and like 
i don't know 
just 
running around or whatever 
but like 
um 
yeah high school was always just real like 
like 
you know 
you put in like a tiny little bit of effort and you get like a b and that's a 
that's good enough i guess 
yeah it's 
like it's okay i mean it's like a country school which was always real weird too i was always like 
me and like my friends were always like the 
because i used to have real long hair 
and so that was like 
i used to be like a big hippie or whatever and like 
um 
that was 
i guess 
weird kind of like 
being 
the odd people in a in a small like 
in a small midwestern farming 
school it is kind of odd i guess 
um 
i don't know 
um 
yeah 
yeah 
it was just like there was a lot of people 
there who you know like their parents were farmers and or 
they they 
were whatever you 
know it was 
like 
like 
preppy kids or like 
hick 
type kids you know who 
yeah 
yeah 
i mean there was like a there was like 
a 
lot of kids who were who 
were 
different but just like 
not 
the majority or whatever 
like 
not really i mean i 
played we played with friends we never played anywhere just fooling around like 
in people's 
basements and stuff like 
never really 
organized enough 
to 
try and 
play anywhere 
really 
guitar 
bass 
yeah 
like 
like real like 
you know like 
jam oriented stuff you know like 
the dead stuff like that 
like 
i don't know 
like 
like 
like dead 
kind like reggae type stuff too just like 
a bunch of different things 
yeah things that are like simple chord changes and you can just fool around with them and stuff 
not really 
um i'm 
more into 
like 
more beat beat oriented music 
like 
um 
since i like i go to 
like 
so called raves or whatever 
yeah 
like 
um 
i really 
like into 
that like 
just that type of music and um 
i don't know 
uh i 
haven't really 
played music in awhile because like 
um 
i'm starting to get back into it just doing different things 
uh 
like here 
i've been 
you know 
they've been here 
for a while and 
then there wasn't any parties here for a little while 
and then uh 
i been to ones in cleveland  dayton 
uh akron detroit new 
york 
pittsburgh 
philadelphia 
it's like 
it is um 
it's like there's flyers and stuff that you see or whatever and 
um you 
and 
and you get directions to it and it will be in a 
you know there's 
a a bunch of different places it will be in you know like a sports arena or something or or it depends how big they are i mean there's ones where there's like 
two hundred people there's 
ones where there like five there's ones where there a 
thousand there's ones where there are like 
three thousand and like there's ones in canada 
i didn't i didn't go to one but some of my friends went to it where there's like 
fifteen thousand people there or something like that 
like 
i don't know how it is in canada i think yeah it's a 
big arena like a civic center or something like that 
and 
i think that's really weird 
but 
that's like too big 
but um 
it's 
kind of 
it's it's interesting here 
you know you just go to like 
uh i mean sometimes they got warehouses or 
or um 
like 
auditoriums or stuff and it's just like 
dance 
music and lights 
and stuff 
it's 
real fun 
yeah because it's all continuously mixed so 
it's like it's not 
it's not real 
i like it how 
like the rave scene is kind of like 
faceless 
because it's like it's not more like 
rock star oriented and stuff it's more it's more just like kind of a serious 
type 
type thing but 
but but 
not so like glam and 
like fame oriented and stuff 
yeah it's not like 
there is a face behind like the music but not so much too you know it's not like 

like because there's not like 
like a 
a like a defined lead 
lead person because just one person doing it most of the 
most of time i mean like 
people do 
have groups that play like 
techno beat 
oriented music but it's not like 
a lead singer who like 
you know is like that it's not like that at all 
yeah 
i mean it's like 
it's known but it's in a different way it's like a different type of fame than like 
traditional style so 
it's like more of like a respect as opposed to like an admiration type thing like 
like it's more of like a 
it's not like an m t v 
type thing you know 
like 
i don't know 
it's like it's 
it's really serious and it's really not serious like 
it's 
it's everything i guess 
yeah like a lot of people like 
i don't i don't know why a lot of people go but like 
with a a lot of people i know it's like 
go to hear really good 
and like 
it's amazing like 
what 
happens you know like people 
together and 
like people dancing together you look out and everybody's dancing you know 
and like 
music's really good and everybody's really into it and 
working 
yeah 
like underground 
no it's gotten real big 
like it's still different too there's still like a really big scene and there's still like a smaller underground scene like 
it's like a double scene 
like it's weird 
yeah 
no i i don't wanna 
like 
i don't wanna spin like 
i just wanna like 
i don't know try and do different things like 
like 
most music i listen to is like drum and bass where it's like 
basslines and like 
staggered backbeats and stuff 
and like 
i can play bass and like i i have like 
like a processor thing and stuff that i fool around with just doing stuff like that and some of my friends like play on drum machines and stuff like that so i just do stuff like that more like 
it's not it's not like you're playing 
like you're not spinning records just like 
making 
yeah 
yeah 
just like there's a lot of different 
uh 
like influences and everything 
and like there's just a lot of places you can go with it 
so it's real good 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah like 
like sort of 
i mean with like 
m p threes and stuff 
people do a lot of that 
but 
it's 
it's 
i don't 
i don't know 
i don't 
i don't really go on the internet all that much 
like 
i don't know 
yeah 
yeah well like um 
like 
my dad like 
went 
to florida and i was with him there for a little while 
and 
then i 
um 
he moved to texas because like he was moving into like the he was going to s m u there 
and like 
so i moved 
back 
from florida back to up 
up here because i didn't wanna i didn't wanna go with 
because texas is terrible 
and like 
um 
so 
then like my mom 
see like 
my parents got divorced when i was like five or something 
and so 
um 
i was living with my mom 
and 
like half and half like 
joint custody or whatever i was living with my mom 
half with my dad and then when my dad moved to florida i moved with him 
and then 
uh my mom ended up 
getting remarried and like my dad have remarried by that 
time too 
and 
my mom 
remarried 
and 
and they lived 
moved out to sunbury and 
like 
this house on five acres or whatever and so 
then 
um 
when i came back i just 
lived with her 
up there 
yeah 
think when i was five 
because it was like 
yeah 
yeah i don't really  remember them being really together 
like 
ever 
but 
i don't know it was real weird i 
um 
i don't know i mean 
i 
i like florida just because it's not cold 
and it's 
it's really nice but it rains a lot i mean 
and i 
i mean i 
i'd rather live out 
west because it's like a dry heat as opposed to being 
i mean it's nice that it's 
ninety degrees but it's not nice that it's like ninety percent humidity i mean 
that's kind of 
kind of sucks but 
um 
it's just different to live in florida and how you think of florida 
being is real different like 
um 
i like it because 
kind of 
the drivers aren't so insane like they are here 
like people are a little bit more laid back just because like 
um 
i know in parts it is really insane but like 
sometimes just people would just like 
because it's all 
because it's nice weather people don't get so like aggravated by like here it's like cold and and grey and you just wanna like 
yell at people in your car and stuff or something i don't know i don't know if people's deal is 
um 
but 
yeah i don't know 
yeah 
i think it's like there's like a real like 
either it's it's old people who are there 
retiring or whatever 
or it's 
more of like a younger 
people there 
i don't know 
you don't see a lot i don't know there is middle aged people there but it's not so apparent like 
as here i guess 
yeah that's what it seems i mean 
i know it's like 
i mean it's the same proportions i mean there are more old people there but 
just seems more apparent just because of how 
but you can like go outside all the time 
you know i mean there's never 
like three or four months where you just wanna 
sit in your house and 
um 
i was in more north florida 
around tallahassee 
so that's a that's a little different i mean that's 
that's 
not 
that's more southern georgia basically 
um 
i don't know i mean 
yeah it's not so touristy 
and they had they had the thing where 
you couldn't have any buildings bigger than the state capital because they didn't want it to be like orlando or miami like miami especially 
so that was really interesting it was 
a different type of town 
like not not so many palm trees more big 
oak trees and stuff like that 
yeah 
it's real 
it's more 
not all of a centralized downtown it's more of a 
like spreading out 
yeah 
it's a lot smaller than columbus though 
i think 
columbus is really interesting how it how it  develops compared to 
like 
i don't know just 
like how 
like how columbus is different 
it is a 
a real standard midwest city just how it's 
designed and laid out compared to like philadelphia you know or uh just 
like when it was settled and and 
when it was made 
just how like 
more of the streets are more it's all 
like 
planned out more as opposed to like in 
in philly 
or places like that more east coast it's like 
the roads 
parts of them are real small and like 
and other parts are all hilly and curving around and stuff 
and 
so that's kind of interesting i mean 
i think 
it's also odd like the urban sprawl of columbus how 
it um 
just the suburbs develop and how it's like more of a metropolitan area as opposed to a centralized 
area that's really big like our 
like 
columbus's downtown 
it's really odd too 
i mean 
there's nothing to do down there 
it's all 
businesses and like the couple shops that are down there close at like six i mean there's like 
couple restaurants or something 
but 
i mean it's it's different when you think of other cities you know it's more of like a downtown is where you go to hang out but here it's like campus 
or more of  
like you hang out like 
i don't know it's more of like a  like a suburban 
town as opposed to like a centralized downtown 
yeah 
it's 
just 
like 
you know like a half an hour or 
uh 
or i mean in  twenty minutes outside you know you can get to dublin or fifteen minutes to dublin or something like that you know i mean that's still like a part of 
of columbus as opposed to 
yeah 
yeah 
not really i mean 
i go to 
like 
i go to this club axis sometimes 
i mean that's short north whatever 
like it's okay 
um 
like 
i don't know i mean the red zone's downtown or whatever i don't go to that i really don't like that place but um 
i don't know 
uh 
kind of the winter months really kill like doing anything like really any like foot traffic type things 
i mean in the summer 
it seems like it seems 
in the winter it seems there's more 
uh 
that like you have to do something like it's more of uh uh this big precession to do anything you know you have to put on like 
all of these coats where more in the summer you can just walk in and out of your house and like 
go 
go to the park and sit and it's fine but like 
here you know you get 
slush everywhere and you got to think of so something to do you just can't like drive around and waste time because it's 
because it's miserable 
yeah 
yeah 
i i did 
telemarketing for a while but that's that's 
that's terrible people yeah i got tired of people yelling at me and like 
you interrupted my dinner and blah blah blah 
and like 
but it was okay because the place i worked at didn't monitor our calls 
so you just yell at them and you'd just be like i don't care 
like 
i'm glad i interrupted your dinner fine 
whatever 
like 
some people would be really nice um 
and other people would 
just be unbelievably rude it's so funny 
um 
but 
now i do this 
this uh 
work at this place called  
i work there with 
works there too so 
i mean  worked at the telemarketing place too 
with me so 
it makes it bearable 
uh 
like it just 
because i worked there for a while before she did and it was just it was really annoying 
like 
um 
but 
both places it's cubicles you know and that's really weird too 
um 
cubicles are 
odd how that develops 
i don't know 
yeah and like a 
keyboard and 
like this phone 
you put on a headset and 
and 
okay i mean people call in and 
um 
it's like a mail order catalog thing 
and 
um 
so 
i don't know people are really really incompetent it's really funny 
like because some people 
um 
i don't know how 
they have like 
even 
some people who 
can't speak english even well enough i don't know how they got signed up or how they even have a credit card to order 
i mean 
and too you can tell especially when 
because people call from all over it's really funny to talk to people from 
alabama or south carolina like i never knew people from south carolina had such thick 
accents 
like i never really thought of 
north carolina and south carolina being 
really southern 
even though 
i mean 
they seceded first you know i i mean  
i just  
just 
that's different i always thought that more being east coast as opposed to so southern 
and man there's people there who i 
can't even understand what they're saying 
and 
like i don't know especially too 
how 
all like you have to give 
numbers and all the numbers and stuff and type it in real fast people go unbelievably fast when they say like 
a ten string number and then they get mad at you when like you can't type it in fast enough 
like if they just said it slow once it would save time 
and um 
just how to 
how 
how three d eight a 
and a bunch of numbers all sound the same like d b three eight a all sound the same 
and um 
and people 
you know 
you're like 
a as in 
apple and they're like 
apple what what you talking about 
something like that you're like 
for real weird 
and um 
just how 
they're like where's my membership number and they can't find it 
all right all right look on the catalog where it says m e m number 
that would be your membership number and people are like oh all right all right 
but 
i don't know like i i 
really don't i really wanna get 
a job 
that's 
like 
in a warehouse or something 
so i'm real easy where i can just like load boxes or something 
because 
like i never have time to really 
i mean like i try and do do like kind of try and do yoga but it's like fussy we work two thirty to eleven 
so it's like by the time you get home it's like just want to sit 
and like not 
do anything 
and like 
um 
you know working out is hard and stuff because you don't have time so i want to have a job where 
if i don't have time at the end of the day to work out it's like i'm working out sort of 
like 
as during my job and like 
i really hate talking on the phone now 
like having jobs for 
a while where i talk on the phone makes me just not want to talk on the phone at all at home 
or too like when i'm on the phone at home like 
then it like 
brings weird flashbacks to work 
so it's like i will start like talking like i'm at work you know 
so it's like 
like 
i don't know pick up the phone like 
yeah 
it is weird like 
i don't know 
this microphone's a little bit different so 
it's not that bad because 
a lot of times 
it's just busy for a while and then it's like 
not busy at later at night 
um 
so  and i can just talk because we sit right next to each other 
so that's okay 
that's good that's real good 
well it's this 
it's like  corporation like i don't know it's just this 
like kind of 
this 
generic catalog thing i don't i don't know 
like 
it's like shopper's advantage  
it has some internet thing with it too 
um 
but 
not really 
yeah there's like 
people call in and talk about other like they saw it in this other 
mail order catalog that i've never heard of either 
it's 
i don't know how really they do it 
like it's just like they get 
people's names and stuff from 
credit card 
companies and then mail them out things and 
people call back or whatever 
like 
it's everything pretty 
i mean 
like 
basic stuff that you it would be at like 
you know like a 
lazarus or something like that you know or 
a bunch different places you know like 
electronics uh appliances 
uh 
uh 
yeah i don't know like 
stereos tvs uh washers dryers uh 
like 
weird things too like 
as seen on tv things you know 
like people 
too like when people order a bunch of crap i just want to tell them i'm like no don't do that like 
don't waste like 
thirty dollars on like commemorative coins or something or like i don't even know what their doing 
or too like when it's really apparent 
that people shouldn't be 
charging this on their credit card 
when it's like 
you put in one credit card and it doesn't go through because it's maxed i just want tell them like no 
don't do that like but you can't do that or or you get in trouble or whatever 
and 
it's just funny how 
yeah like it's real weird at uh at our office 
that um 
um 
the first place i've ever went to where like you clock in 
you know that's kind of odd 
kind of like think of a factory like a 
like a punch card or something 
but um 
and just how uh 
like 
there's this whole thing yeah 
can't wear hats and 
uh in the building and this whole thing about trying to have a professional attitude and stuff 
and it's just real funny to hear hear people speak like that and really believe it 
like it's like we're taking catalog orders over the phone it's not a really a big deal like they're not seeing how we're dressed at all i mean 
they tell us we're suppose to wear collared shirts and stuff but nobody does like they don't really enforce it 
and 
they too they yell at like 
and i if like 
for hugging or whatever like they told us that one day that we couldn't hug 
they were like no it's like you can't hug in here or something like that 
they were like  it 
away from the professional attitude 
it's like i don't even know what to say to people like that like 
it's just like such a different 
like 
ideology on it on everything it's just like 
yeah you have you follow the script it that that's real funny too 
like 
you know  you get  
um they they listen to you 
like they monitor the calls 
and 
um 
you know they listen to you and then it's like this sheet like if you asked for the specials and like 
if you 
you know said it in this way and like if you used this or whatever you know and like 
um um oh it's just real weird 
yeah yeah 
like 
um 
you have to say  
at the end of the call you're supposed to tell them 
um 
you know don't forget to try your member benefits on line at  dot com 
and like i will i will like i sometimes i will say it real you know like 
kinda like the movie phone voice so i will be like  dot com 
people are just like 
like uh i don't know 
sometimes like it's 
sometimes um 
it's yeah it's like mess around with people 
like 
um 
sometimes like uh 
if i don't feel like taking the calls or whatever 
like i will 
uh like i won't listen to what the people are saying i will be like yep 
yep 
like no we don't  we don't have that or something like 
i do that every once in a while just like when i get bored 
but most of the time like i try and uh 
like most of the time it's pretty easy like it's pretty straightforward sometimes it's really aggravating when 
people will call up and they have no idea what they want it's like why did you do this like why did you do this to me 
because they will call 
and they will be like 
yeah i'm 
thinking about  
a blanket 
or like what do you think about those and like it's real funny when people ask me my opinion 
like on things 
like this like 
it's funny when people 
uh 
call up who are close to our age too 
uh 
it's it's funny to hear 
just how how 
nineteen 
eighteen year old people are on the phone it's really funny compared to 
it's funny too when 
when 
you can tell kinda like what  
what people all's backgrounds are and 
what what what kinda like their job is by their  
by 
their  
like how they conduct themselves on the phone 
and people 
you know especially when people who 
you can tell when they've been in the military like they say like alpha 
bravo 
stuff like that for the for the letters like they spell everything out and they say like 
like 
ought for zero sometimes i have people do that and they're like yes  
no  
uh or um 
just uh 
when 
people call a lot people call from new york who are arab 
or 
and they're like 
those people are so aggravating they're like 
i don't  what to see if i i want 
this 
have i saw stereo in 
in store i like and it's like man i don't know what you're saying like 
and um 
it's real funny too when uh 
or like 
i don't know what oh yeah like when 
when they're in new york and it's all real loud and there's like cars and sirens in the background and and stuff 
or when people 
um 
yeah like this lady asked me she's like  
she was telling me uh about 
she was getting like some 
bedroom set or something like that like some sheets or something and she was like asking me if it would go with her wallpaper and stuff and she was like 
she's like 
describing it to me 
like all right this has a green trim with like a flowers design she was like do you think this like 
blue will accent it or something and i'm like yeah sure whatever like 
i don't 
yeah well like the catalog's real small 
and we have like five hundred thousand things and like the catalog has like a hundred of them 
so that's really annoying too 
because 
then people call up with all these like 
things that we like 
don't know if we have in our computer's are really really old 
like 
it's like an old style mainframe 
and it's 
it's one color text no pictures 
people always ask you what things look like and then 
you don't 
can't tell them 
and two 
it's like the computers are all screwed up 
like you type in you will like type in computers and it will say we don't have them but we obviously do 
and like 
you will look at it a different way and you will be able to find them like it's uh it's really weird like i don't understand 
yeah like it will be under something real weird or like 
multimedia or something like that 
you know it's like 
i don't know who 
who 
how they it designed that way 
that is funny too how people care 
like 
people apologize too when when they're dumb or whatever and it's like 
like they care so much you know about somebody that they're talking to on the phone for like 
five minutes 
um 
i don't know 
it is  people sometimes ask me like  where we are you know i tell them like columbus ohio and like 
um 
like 
i talked to some lady from  
from uh new jersey she was like 
twenty or something for 
for a long time she was  she was real funny just uh 
how 
how 
accents are 
in philly she would say like horrible 
and uh 
saying numbers like 
like  and 
or kind of like an east coast accent she it was real funny and she was just asking me like what it looked 
like 
in our building 
you know 
so that's always funny too you know you call people from the phone you don't know what they look like you don't know what the other person looks like and what the building is set up like 
it's interesting 
sometimes people just go on and on about things 
like 
hi i got a a or like they have like some 
like insane problem 
like i don't know why they're sharing it with me 
like 
you know like 
i had to 
get 
this 
you know i had to get this chair because my brother in law yeah he sat on it and broke it 
man i got in a fight with him about that 
yeah his wife and blah blah blah and going on and on about it and it's like 
like yep 
like 
his wife is a bitch or something i don't know 
i don't know what 
or like i talked to this one guy he was 
he was a navy seal 
and he did like a couple tours in vietnam 
and he was 
he was talking about how he is 
he was drunk and he was he was from 
alabama he was like yeah i'm about half drunk now so i'm trying to 
figure out where this model number is 
and like 
to him for like 
it's like 
like sometimes too i think about 
people you know 
they call 
and especially when i 
talk to this sometimes people call in and i i  you know i get the same 
people or whatever 
every once in a while especially if like there's 
people have real specific weird names or something that i can remember 
i will they will call back and i will 
think about them and it's like 
how i will have this 
you know 
it's like we have this weird like 
five minute relationship something like that like  every couple of weeks or something and it's like 
what to think about what their life is like 
and what they are actually like in the you know it's like 
it's real weird 
it's like 
i know 
yeah get everybody 
yeah 
harvey keitel 
that's what i was actually thinking of 
um where he takes the pictures on the corner 
of at the same time everyday 
yeah 
yeah 
and only for like a 
brief period 
yeah 
uh it's 
it's open twenty four hours so 
there's people that 
you know it's like shifts overlap you know it's not like everybody leaves and there everybody comes in you know 
it's like 
um 
like when we're there like the night shift people start to come in people that work from like eight to four  
eight p m to four a m and 
that be really weird 
i guess like nobody calls then 
or something like 
ten people call so she's like it's easy she's like i get paid to 
she said that it's like i don't know some people who work there 
like 
i couldn't imagine working 
complete nights you know 
i mean 
i like working two thirty to eleven i  i'd rather work like 
maybe like noon to eight 
that would be better because then it's like 
i mean i'm more 
toned to staying up late anyway just because of like 
how it is or whatever but like 
i don't want to have to get up really early either like i could never imagine having a nine to five job like that be horrible 
have to go to bed so early 
yeah 
it's okay 
i don't know like i think  
i think uh high school in general like they i people always talk about raising the standards you know 
for high 
high school things but 
um 
i think 
um 
it's kind of like 
it's 
it's really hard 
to to 
like i've thought about before just what's 
wrong with like the education system in general 
like 
i don't know i think it's more of a 
more of like a 
it's 
college is a little bit different i guess but it's more of like this whole like 
the teacher 
the teacher's talking 
and it like it like the information goes from like 
the  
like the teacher's 
uh mouth to the student's notes with like out   without going through either of their brains you know it's like just from like real monotonous and like you know dates and blah blah blah about 
you know just like  it's it's a 
it's real structured but it's real hard to think about 
what then what i could what to do to change that 
it's kind of like more 
like 
i don't know i mean i had really good like there was a couple really good teachers like my history  teachers and english teachers were really good 
um 
just because 
you know 
it was more 
like 
they seemed like they wanted to be there as opposed to 
i'm just doing this  because i don't know why or whatever and it seems like too 
they they 
i hate it when people 
it's obvious that if they didn't have the textbook they wouldn't know how to do it 
you know like where if people didn't have their notes like they wouldn't be able to do it themselves you know 
it's kind of like 
um 
and so i think 
it's  
that when people have real enthusiasm and like  or and 
put a lot of effort into making it not the same everyday not just like a lecture and when then we do 
homework and turn it in like you know it's like 
we do 
like 
like in history class we do like role 
role playing things and like 
plays 
like we like just things that are different and like 
my sociology and psychology teacher were real good he did he was the same guy who taught history 
he was real good too like it was really crazy obviously but like 
it's just like 
interesting 
um 
like the sociology of high school and like having a sociology class about a 
just 
well well it's sort of like the sociology of like cliques you know 
like how 
how that develops like 
how people 
like some people seek 
to 
like 
fit in 
like 
like  that's a real strong uh 
like 

uh just how like too 
how there's no real 
like 
everybody conforms to their 
own set of norms in each group you know it's like 
people 
no matter like you know even if ted kaczynski is out 
like 
uh on 
you know wherever in like his little shed 
you know he's still a part of society like how you can't get  from society and just how like 
how society develops in general like how high school's like 
is 
is kind of true to life but then really different too on how life is but just how 
it's just a 
a more of a 
like 
more of a closeknit thing so it's more apparent how how segregation works or whatever 
yeah 
yeah 
people that  
just uh 
really wanna teach as opposed to like i don't know why other people wanna 
like 
even went into teaching at all you know 
but um 
i think that would help just making it more like not so impersonal not so 
this is 
you know you do this to get this certain grade it's like you do this to learn this because it's interesting as opposed to like 
and 
i don't know 
i think it's like there's a lot of things that 
it's more 
like compulsory 
education is weird 
like 
being forced to take this class like i think that if i uh but  i mean it's good to being forced to take a  like a liberal arts thing because like you don't know what you  
wanna do 
so it's like if like you hate math and you don't take it at all but then you decide you wanna do something in math then you're like screwed like 
can't go back 
see i hate that like 
all the work that you do is like reduced to like one letter 
and it's   i like how 
see like i thought about going to antioch but it was it was really expensive and like 
um i don't know 
but 
just because the  and the school's 
more of a 
nontraditional  type where 
they give you 
like evaluations and you don't get grades like and so 
so then it  
that's what that's what i heard it's like at antioch where the professor writes 
uh like a couple page paper 
on your 
like 
performance on the quarter and that that really shows that 
i mean that's a lot of work for the professor but like 
that really shows that he's really involved in noticing what you're doing as opposed to 
just like 
some kid in his class you 
yeah 
like 
i'm not  
i'm not really sure like how 
they 
how the interview works to become a teacher 
um 
i don't know i think it's like a lot of times 
they're really desperate to find  
and so they really just 
take whoever i mean 
they're lucky enough to even  have a body to fill the 
place and they're doing well enough i mean the kids are learning the material i mean 
sort of i mean 
i mean i  it's working well enough i guess i mean 
like 
people are learning things and like wanting to go on to college and stuff 
um 
i don't know 
uh 
maybe  
i think 
maybe if 
teachers just their status in society isn't real high when it should be 
um 
it's more 
like i you know i've heard that like garbage men get paid more than teachers you know and 
how 
but it um 
so it's just like 
people always talk about you know education for the  
you know we gotta like 
think about our child's future or whatever but 
really teachers are 
paid crap 
like 
don't really get a lot of respect from anybody 
like professors and stuff get  
get  like 
more of a respect but 
like 
it's just like 
like the teachers that you have especially in elementary school like in critical periods in 
in your life like in  like especially in adolescence too like really influence like how you are as a person and like people don't 
like take that for granted a lot 
like if you have bad teachers in one subject you're gonna hate that subject 
you know and like if you have good teachers you're gonna love it i mean 
that really  influences too like how 
like what you wanna do with your life you know 
and people don't really 
acknowledge that too much 
sometimes i think that it's just like math sucks and it's like 
a like there's no there's not a lot you really you can really do with that 
yeah 
okay 
yeah sure 
no it's okay 

okay 
well i didn't know if 
you'd give them my name 
yeah if you can 
no 
it's easier than trying to call up 
i will even went to the 
they got a food one over here by the vet clinic 
i went 
one day to eat my lunch all the time 
for two weeks and they paid me ten dollars a day 
well it beats getting a second job 
yep 
half tank gas 
oh i know they don't care they got money people that got them 
they could care less 
yeah 
that's because their parents are rich 
i used to work at baker believe me i know 
yeah 
okay 
yeah meet 
people 
i've lived 
lived in columbus all my life uh 
my dad's 
dead he's been dead about twenty five years 
my mom's still alive she not in real good health 
my wife 
moved from columbus to arizona 
and then she moved back here and we got married uh 
said i grew up here i used to hunt 
fact is you know where henderson olentangy and bethel road i used to hunt all up in through there 
yeah that was all 
woods and everything back and nobody wanted even live up in there 
it was trash area 
yeah you gotta remember it was all swamps back when i was a kid 
uh 
like i said i grew up down here 
it was mostly farmlands when i grew up around here 
and stuff 
uh because i used to go from henderson 
down to lane avenue and i hit one light on olentangy that was it 
yeah well it's got a lot worse uh 
when i say a lot worse 
because 
if you know you say you don't have kids i got a kid twenty three years old and there was no place for him to play 
basically you know we used to be able to go to the woods and everything else now 
you don't even see merry go rounds on the playground because people would sue over it 
no offense people are 
ridiculous 
uh 
yeah 
i got a 
and then he's got a 
son so i guess i'm a grandfather 
i 
i hardly ever see m 
but 
that's because i'm not home a lot 
and 
like i said my wife's here 
now   
just moved to texas so she's living down in texas 
and she's got 
brothers and sisters all over the united states 
yeah 
uh 
i'm trying to figure out what else to tell you 
i've worked here at the university 
uh twenty four years 
before that i worked at uh channel four tv station for about five years 
so i started work when i was fourteen and i've been working ever since 
i've been out of school since i was sixteen so i 
i was in the service i was in vietnam 
uh is there anything else you need to know or 
well i used 
i used to fish and stuff like that but i've had skin cancer i've had four heart attacks 
and if you look at my skin now you see all the blisters and stuff on 
i can't even go out in the sun that long 
i've had melanoma cancer and stuff so i sold my boat 
now mainly my hobby is uh 
just tinkering around and stuff fix 
i will buy a car fix it up and sell it 
or something like that just for something to do 
uh 
trying to retire here from the university so i can get more hobbies 
well see i'm a limited on 
some of the stuff i like to do i like to 
well i'd like to go back and working with my hands and stuff i used to do maintenance uh 
there ain't nothing i can't fix 
you know that's 
not because 
i'm skilled or anything it's because 
well when i was a kid my dad was crippled i had to fix everything so 
yeah so 
basically i learned with him 
i heard do this do that 
but ah 
everybody in my family's mechanically inclined 
uh 
she's disabled 
uh she's got 
she's in a car accident she's got what's called  pain syndrome or something 
like that it's from 
she had  meningitis when she was a kid and it was brought on because of that and plus she's got a glass eye 
so she's very limited on 
working in closed corners and stuff like that 
uh so she's basically disabled 
and that goes 
when they do that it's because of your education and also they take into consideration and everything 
so she  mainly stays at home 
she uh has trouble driving even at night and stuff like that 
with her eye or the car accident 
car accident i'd say about ten years ago 
no she lost her eye when she was six playing cowboys and indians with her brother 
she's a cowboy and he was an indian 
yeah it was a homemade bow and arrow 
which 
every kid in the world plays with 
i'm sure you played with it too 
no 
well you always hear about the b b gun 
you know 
uh 
basically last time i heard he was doing lawn care 
he's done 
about everything like i told him you know 
get as many jobs as you can until you figure out what you wanna do he's done uh 
maintenance work he's done ah 
sales work 
i said he's doing lawn care now he's done uh gardening 
uh 
his girl friend they've lived together he's not married 
like i said he's got a kid now they've been together for about four years 
but uh a lot times he will work for her dad 
now he does a lot of maintenance he was doing dry wall before this i kinda wish he stuck with that 
that's like twenty five or thirty an hour 
but uh 
the company wanted him to move to florida and he didn't wanna move 
so now he's back into lawn care until something else better comes along 
yeah 
don't bother me one bit 
no because i know people that are married don't take care their kids 
he takes care of his 
so to me that's more important 
uh i was only there for couple weeks in the harbor 
i never set foot on land 
no i was in the marines 
but uh 
basically all we did was just go back and forth 
uh from like philippines to vietnam then from uh vietnam to hong kong from hong kong to vietnam 
uh we were floating around just 
they didn't know if they were gonna send us in or not because it was toward the end of it 
i'm not that old yet 
two years 
uh 
i got thrown out of high school 
uh because i wasn't allowed to wear jeans i wasn't allowed to wear tennis shoes 
course everybody else could but 
basically what it was uh 
was a weird situation in high school 
uh it was for me and a couple other people and that was it 
and it's 
you know any 
the  
more strict you make it the more they rebel 
and i was 
type of people 
i was a mean kid 
yeah 
uh yeah 
they uh 
got me one time for cutting zero period 
and the principal was having me sit in the office during zero period to serve detention 
so like if you can tell me how they can get me for cutting class when they ordered me to sit 
in the 
principal's office 
i couldn't figure that one out too 
well at the time when they were having a lot of trouble at school and they just wanted to get rid of some people 
yeah 
yeah i was sixteen when i got out of high school and then i took my g e d at seventeen 
and passed it plus was i went in marine corps at seventeen 
it was probably the best thing for me 
because i 
well i met a lot more different cultures seen how a lot more different people live and found out how lucky i was 
you know 
when you go over there and see people begging for can of beans 
and then you come here you know what i mean you see people standing out on street corners with signs work for food 
i feel like i should be standing out there giving money because my bills are getting behind 
you know 
yeah 
and people don't 
don't realize it 
to some extent yeah but to some extent no because see when i was in the service it was a different time 
uh 
well take for one thing 
when i was overseas if we wanted to do something we'd wait till sergeant went the shed and we'd just put a padlock on the door so he couldn't get out 
and then we'd go do what we wanted to do 
you know 
because when you're overseas it's a different environment 
people are more scared of you than you are of them 
especially if you're 
waiting to go into combat 
because you gotta trust the people you're around you don't 
really wanna piss them off 
excuse me but you know what i mean 
and there's a lot of alcoholics in the military when i was in there 
yeah 
and 
most the time they're putting them in charge well like we'd get 
no offense we'd get these college students coming out that were second lieutenants that thought they know everything 
and some of them did and some of them 
were just complete idiots but you find that 
anywhere 
so you took your good for your bad 
i got a lot of respect for the college kids 
majority of them it's 
it's 
other people i don't have 
for 
well like management here 
well like i'm getting ready to go through layoffs again where i work at 
but yet they got people we had no manager 
say for three months 
so course they took somebody that they were gonna lay off put them in a management position they're making eighty thousand dollars a year 
the can't see nothing wrong with that 
but 
yet they won't lay off people that actually 
need the jobs 
so 
the way the university here is run i can't agree with most stuff they do 
like i said i've been here twenty five years i've seen a lot of weird stuff 
fact is was at baker i seen a manager that had nothing to do for ten years 
yet paid 
every week for doing nothing 
yeah 
yeah 
it ain't gonna change though 
i'm just an operator right now i've done production work too for them 
but basically i went back in operations because 
it's not the money i like the job 
just mount tapes uh 
do printouts monitor systems uh 
people have problems help solve them 
just different stuff it's different every day that's why i like it just like 
you talking to people it's different every day 
and 
i don't like sitting in an office 
uh i did when i worked at the hospital i worked at the hospital here over here where i'm at 
i don't but i'm in a big room like as big as a gymnasium 
and i'm in there by myself 
which is kinda nice i can turn the radio on 
do whatever i want to some degree 
depends on 
who's the manager is the time every manager's got a different agenda on what's 
they want you to do 
i thought it 
was stupid 
yeah 
well 
they needed to strike don't get me wrong that's not the stupid part 
but the part  uh 
a majority of them saying that they were here for ten years and ain't making that much money 
most people would move on 
the university never has money that's like me when i 
first came here the university was not paying me nothing i worked two  
or two jobs for ten years when i was here the first ten years just to make a living 
yeah 
and uh 
i had the prerogative i could have gone somewhere else and made more money 
you know but well what the bad part was is university's trying to do away with civil service 
civil service is a good thing and a bad 
thing 
you know you do 
you had 
raises and everything so it least you did have an increase back then nowadays you have nothing 
it's like where i work at 
the only way i can get raise is by being 
uh 
like the kids used to say a tattletale 
squealer whatever you wanna call 
only way i can get a raise over there where work at 
to be a rat 
yeah 
and it's not 
and that's not right so i've always gotten two percent raises 
even though 
uh 
basically 
i been cross-trained or however you wanna say it i can work in three or four areas where most people can't 
but i've seen people get ten percent raises 
and i've seen me get two percent raise when i'm doing three jobs and they're doing one 
but it 
i'm using me as example because i've seen a lot of other people do the same thing don't get me wrong 
but it just depends upon it still come back to who you know 
because they done away with the uh 
civil service step raises which were wrong cause could have done crummy job and got same raise as doing a good job don't get me wrong 
but now 
it is that you got 
people you don't even respect in management a lot of times giving the raises and they 
have no idea what you're even doing 
example that i asked my manager the other day she told me i was supposed to do this 
certain thing and i asked her i said well 
they told me i wasn't supposed to 
and she said she'd get back to me on it 
well never heard nothing from her 
and she's done that to me i don't know how many times 
but yet that leaves the door open for who to get in trouble 
yeah 
makes her look good 
well 
it's just like your  people you see go to church that walk out of church see somebody sitting there that's homeless 
they will ignore them won't they 
because they're in their good sunday clothes 
well basically the same thing here 
but 
some of your management is real good i've seen people that 
that 
you know are super 
but i've seen people that are bad problem is you get a bad management 
and it can make your life hell i don't care who you are 
nice manager 
so you know what i mean 
i can outlast them 
and i do my job that's sometimes that 
basically hurts worse than 
if you do your job and people know you do your job you got more people that will stick up for you 
without knowing it 
that's fine 
well 
let me ask you this 
where the 
where's the nearest teen club 
there is none 
where's the nearest playground there is none 
where's the nearest sports center there is none 
so 
there's not a whole lot to do except for the hanging out 
so yeah i think society as a whole 
more violent 
the kids are more violent look at the news you see on tv every day you see people getting mad just 
cause they're sitting in traffic 
that's adults 
see people 
now all sudden there's a rash of fires 
you read that in news people keep doing it 
i think society as a whole 
has gotten lot more violent which made the kids more violent 
i don't think it's the cartoons cause come on if they're that stupid 
you know what i mean they they shouldn't even be out on the street i'm sorry 
cause that's like me i watch the three stooges and you don't see me put no crowbar up nobody's nose 
you know 
what it is is most people want don't want kids to live in reality 
and uh 
these kids that are violent 
your whole society's violent i got 
okay 
i just got done helping my sister in law 
that's an example right there she's got five kids 
she's on welfare 
her husband's 
is 
arab right 
he's running an illegal business 
the united states knows about it 
they  
sit there and they will pay the welfare 
they won't do nothing to him 
now what's what kind of impression is 
her kids getting 
you know 
well he's uh 
exporting cars illegally 
yeah 
but he's also 
like i said he's got five kids they live in low income housing they're collecting welfare 
and 
she just came here 
and lived with me a year ago she could have her baby here 
so the state would pay for it 
so he wouldn't have to pay for it 
and she went back to him 
well i think the people that made that law should uh also too not be able to keep their jobs for more than two years and see how they like it 
cause there's some people that actually can't work 
my sister in law is one of them she is just  stupid 
she's got like a third grade education she's like a kid herself 
now people like that can't work when i was a kid 
your family took care of you there wasn't 
the welfare and stuff 
like this 
but you don't have a family structure no more 
uh you're in a high tech society and most people you said you're from new york right 
your family's where 

okay so how are you gonna help them when they're all over 
used to be you lived in a little neighborhood you knew all your neighbors you don't have that now everybody is mobile 
they  had on the news most people keep the house five to seven years before they sell it and move on 
yeah 
yeah 
same 
i've been in the same house for seventeen years 
and the only way i'd move is if the neighborhood went down and 
when i say went down i'm talking about way down 
i like where i'm at 
and i got good neighbors 
i think that influences how everybody behaves not only the kids the adults too 
well 
it's 
well let's put it this way i can go out and make money without even making money off the government agencies if i wanted to if i wanted to be a crook i could 
i could be a crook 
and uh 
i could have people rent me a house low income i could move in there 
i could do all kinds of stuff 
you know 
to make money on the side 
all through the government 
uh 
that's what i mean it it's too easy to get away with stuff nowadays 
well 
let's put this way if your kids are in my yard doing something and i yelled at them 
you're liable to come down to my house and either shoot me sue me 
or have me locked up right 
when i was a kid if 
neighbor yelled at me 
i better make damn sure he didn't tell my dad 
because i would've gotten my ass whipped 
nowadays you don't have that 
you know what are you going to 
you hit that kid 
you're going to jail 
yeah 
yeah 
well is it 
i had the same thing happen to my kid  i smacked him one time 
you know and it was in the butt going get me wrong 
he told me he was gonna have me uh locked up for child abuse 
so i threw his ass in the car and took him downtown 
and took him inside 
and told him to tell them people 
because they're gonna lock him up 
if i'm an unfit parent not me 
that put a stop to that right away 
uh about twelve 
because see i'm his stepfather 
and i've heard the thing you know you're not my real father and all that we went through all that 
that's just like i told him 
take everything you got that your real father got you 
and you can hit the road if you want 
of course the only thing he had was nothing 
now i got him 
i got him sounds like i bought a dog 
but you know what i mean when he was about nine years old but he's known me 
all my life 
so you know what i mean it wasn't no big shock 
uh 
but see his father lived right around corner and never even had nothing to do with him 
but when he did have something to do with him 
it was kinda strange they would go out and whistle at girls and stuff like that 
and and you know i was 
here i am in a predicament i can't say nothing to them 
you know 
that's his real father so i gotta sit there and keep my mouth shut 
yeah 
none 
whatsoever 
he will  yeah he will basically tell you he don't have no except for me 
oh yeah 
yeah but see that was coming from his 
more than him 
you know 
but of course whenever they needed a ride or anything like that they come to me 
you know 
well 
it's just the same as when i was a kid 
it's whatever you gonna get away with 
you know 
uhhum 
yeah but fifty years ago if you had epilepsy they'd lock you in closet and throw away the key 
and wouldn't let 
out 
most the parent i've seen 
to me i'd rather see the kids with a step parent 
because i've seen lot of bad parents 
i've  
seen a lotta bad people you know what i mean i 
have 
people 
know you 
about drugs and all that 
i've seen people sitting there drinking 
you ask where their  i don't know he's outside somewhere 
now those people don't wanna take time nowadays it's easier just to give a kid a 
beeper 
if you need them beep them 
then actually know where he's going 
every kid that my kid ran around with i knew his parents 
one way or the other 
and you know 
i'd show up at their house if i thought something was going on 
you know it don't matter to me i'm just 
like said i 
grew up here in columbus ohio i'm just a dumb hillbilly 
like  
if they were having a party at somebody's house and their parents didn't know i'd 
up 
there asking what the hell was going on 
you know 
no because them kids still stop at my house 
even though my kid is not there they will stop by my house just to say hi 
and most kids don't do that nowadays 
you know 
well  
also too when is the last time you seen a baseball game 
kids playing a baseball game in the neighborhood 
you don't 
yeah 
what's really weird is i can go over my mom's neighborhood 
you will still see kids playing out there in the school yard playing baseball 
now i got a 
school yard right next to me you come up there and you see no kids doing it 
it's like 
each 
neighborhood's got a little different 
i think that's bullshit 
my dad was crippled for  for nine months he was in a cast from his neck down to his ankles 
he had 
a hip fusion is what it was called back then they had no 
artificial hips 
he had one leg three inches shorter than the other and he had no hip joint 
whatsoever it was just 
ground up bone 
so my mom was working and uh   
this going to sound sickening 
i was 
years old i'd even have to come home from school and stick suppositories up him 
to take care of him i mean for twelve years old no offense 
when 
to be 
and  
it didn't hurt me none 
you know 
i think it just depends upon like i said 
a lot of factors know it's your neighborhood your neighbors 
most kids don't have nothing to do in their neighborhood 
even 
and how many empty lots do you see nowadays 
it still comes back to 
like when i was a kid we had go carts we had mini bikes we had all that kind of stuff 
you know  
ain't no way in hell you have 
nowadays 
your kid be thrown in jail you'd be getting sued for not having insurance 
you know  
society again is taking away everything from you 
yes and no 
uh when we were in boy scouts we got kicked out of it 
you know what i mean we had more fun on our  
uh where i grew up i grew up 
like i said right over here on olentangy there used to be a 
pond over here at the cemetery we used to go 
there everyday or 
this is in the summer now we'd go down to 
uh 
river to go 
over there where  
dodridge is 
there used to be a bash recreation center with a miniature golf course and everything 
now what that's industrial nuclearonics or something like that 
think about now you got the wetlands down there 
you know 
where are kids gonna go 
no 
not 
like they used to 
the  majority are the ones that don't get the guidance 
at home 
that you're trying to reach ain't gonna go to boy scouts 
basically what you need more is 
like recreation centers or something in their own neighborhood 
where they can go everyday 
the way i look at it 
also   
when i was a kid like i said i started working two jobs when i was fourteen you can't even find a job unless you're sixteen nowadays 
so it's kinda hard you know what i mean  
to do a lotta things 
because   they're saying you're still a kid but yet 
you know what i mean 
can't do this you can't do that 
yeah 
yeah but i mean you know 
a 
that 
you know might wanna save up for something when he's twelve years old has no chance at all getting a job 
yeah  well we did that too 
i got one sister 
yeah 
yeah she lives over by uh riverside hospital 
about once a week 
my wife sees her usually more than me 
no my mom 
uh 
not an invalid 
uh she's seventy two years old but 
they go out 
usually to yard sales 
stuff like that stuff i don't wanna do 
no offense 
yeah 
well put this way 
when i was a kid 
you didn't wanna be brought home by the police 
you were actually scared of police 
nowadays  what's kids scared of nothing 
ain't a damn thing they're scared of whenever we were kids we used to make zip guns 
we'd take an ink pen 
take the pen piece out put a firecracker in 
put so it fizzed and you know you'd pack it full and you had a gun 
you know that the stuff like that's 
always been around 
but it seems now that 
the guns are more 
you can get them easier 
it's like me i could be carrying a gun right now what are they gonna do to me 
they ain't gonna lock me up 
carrying a concealed weapon they're gonna slap me on the arm 
now if i shoot you they might do  i mean don't get me wrong i ain't 
but i mean if i shoot you they might do something but otherwise than that they ain't gonna do nothing 
depends upon how i store it now 
when i was a kid raised up we had gun locks on our guns even though i could pick them 
i mean it 
gun locks are easy to pick you can break into anything 
uh 
but when i was a kid too we used go out turkey shoots and i'd go hunting all the time 
so i was pretty familiar with guns 
my kid uh he grew up he was familiar with guns 
he also knew not to touch them 
if you know what i mean 
but i had no pistols at my house i had shotguns and rifles 
now to me a lot of these pistols like a twenty five caliber 
come on there is no use for gun like that 
thirty eight derringer you know 
the only time the use for guns like that is to carry to shoot somebody 
when i  
yeah when 
when i worked at bars i carried a gun constantly and 
most the cops in neighborhood knew i carried a gun 
but they didn't say nothing to me because they knew the reason why 
it's because i carried the bar receipts 
now i could see to carrying one to that 
degree but 
there're 
you know there's a limit you got all these people carrying guns because they will tell you well it's the neighborhood i live in or you have women carrying guns even down here on campus 
because they walk late at night 
uh 
it's just 
there we go again who's right who's wrong i have no idea 
and you even got these 
the uh what stunt guns they're the ones that scare me 
what 
them little electric shock things 
i got a bad heart i don't know what that'd do to me 
yeah but 
guns are always gonna be around ain't gonna get rid of them 
but why would you make stricter gun laws when you can't even enforce your traffic laws 
you know so basically 
well yeah it might work but to me it's kinda stupid you know because what you're saying is 
we're gonna take this 
law and  gonna stick you on this 
law but the hell with all the other laws 
so is that really fair 
i 
i've almost been hit i don't know how many times people talking on telephones i see people turning with no turn signals 
you know just turn right out front of you 
everybody's running red lights nowadays 
mean which laws you gonna pick out to enforce and which laws ain't you 
uh 
to me if you gonna enforce the gun laws and make them 
stricter 
what you ought to do is 
put a limit 
on the barrel length and stuff on guns you get caught with a gun 
with a  
barrel smaller than uh 
eight inches you go to jail 
no ands ifs or buts you go to jail for three years 
if you got an eight inch barrel on your gun now you tell me where are you gonna put it 
you isn't gonna get a lot of dates 
but 
you understand what i'm saying it's  
you gonna have to make 
make it so the guns that you got are harder to conceal 
yeah 
well 
you can carry a weapon here in columbus 
i can carry a weapon right now as long as out the open 
course i'm gonna get stopped for suspicious person everywhere i go 
but 
you know   still 
the 
it's constitution and stuff like that 
you know they always bring it back our forefathers did this and our forefathers did that 
well our forefathers also 
were squatters does that mean i can move into this room 
and tell you it's mine now 
come on you know 
people 
i don't know i'd hate to be in a predicament of having to change anything 
because be hard to change for one group and not another 
you know 
so i don't know where to go 
to me the biggest thing would be if they got rid of these saturday night special guns and stuff like that 
yeah 
you're  
yeah you always still gonna have violence like we were kids 
like me and you would meet we'd get in a fight and after that we'd be best friends now 
now i'd be walking down the street 
hell fourteen year olds scare me to death right now 
not knowing they're gonna whip out a gun or not he ain't gonna go to jail 
and then they're gonna say they wanna nail their parents 
you know their parents are sitting at home they have no idea what their kid's doing 
the parents have so much responsibility but the kid has so much responsibility and then society has so much responsibility so 
you know what i mean basically all that 
all i've ever seen is 
well like these kids that get in the house 
they go to the house they find a gun and they wanna hold the parents responsible 
yes and no on that 
if the parents had the gun 
in the house they had the 
ammunition locked up say in the trunk of their car 
what if the kid bought the ammunition from somewhere else and picked the gun lock off the gun 
so basically there's no way 
you know unless you have a steel cabinet to put that gun in 
and there we go 
rich can afford that but the poor can't 
and most your people that 
own guns that are 
killing people are usually your poorer people 
most the 
i have 
uh i got one neighbor that hates me and he's a sheriff 
and 
otherwise no i don't have hardly any trouble with the kids i have more trouble with the parents 
you know 
i don't 
no i don't fear none of the kids 
yes to some degree they should but there we go again that's just like the people when i worked in bars 
they'd always want to hold the 
responsible 
but say you could come up 
i give you a beer and you could give it to somebody else 
but even though you're not responsible i'm the one supposed be responsible 
people 
you know that have the beer party in the house 
yeah  they should be held responsible 
to some degree but 
we're in a society that loves to sue people 
you know how far are they held responsible i don't know you'd have to go on a case by case basis 
on that 
well when 
when i was growing up there wasn't as that much violence and i could go in indiana and i have done it now 
my name ain't on this report so you can't do nothing about 
i picked eighty pounds of pot 
one time growing along the railroad tracks and brought it back to columbus 
eighty pounds 
it used to grow wild when i was 
kid 
you could find it all over the place 
and you didn't 
the violence and stuff like that i have never  
and you know i'm just using pot right now 
i've never heard anybody going on a 
shooting rampage that were high on pot most of them are sitting home waiting on a pizza 
a pizza 
you know now 
i've seen more people violent on liquor 
like said i worked in bars and i'm 
and i've  
it's just like cocaine and stuff like that you know your laws are different crack cocaine's one 
the powder cocaine's another 
you know and 
what they're saying  
on that is uh 
that's a prejudice thing is what they're saying cause they're saying more blacks do  crack cocaine than powder cocaine cause of prison thing i'm sure you've read the papers 
the way i look at it uh i've had four heart attacks every time i have a heart attack okay 
they swear up and down i do cocaine 
which i've never done i don't want to 
but 
to me 
some drugs should be legal 
some drugs should be illegal 
but to me 
alcohol should be more illegal than half your drugs 
because i've seen more violence 
on alcohol i've seen more women beat i've seen more kids beat 
i've seen more drunken driving wrecks 
you know 
well 
seen people driving wrong way on the freeway right 
when they're drunk 
when's the last time you read about somebody driving the wrong way on the freeway from smoking a joint 
yeah 
that or they're so paranoid you know what i mean 
worried about stopping 
and i'm just using that as an example you know what i mean your other drugs i don't know 
much about them 
well they always did because first time i had one i was thirty six years old 
and whenever you have a heart attack anymore they always  suspect coke is the first thing 
because it stops your heart right away 
yeah 
what i mean they go by your age too 
yeah and then when they 
yeah 
yeah then when they did the blood test they found out i had hypertension plus 
disease 
had nothing 
not really you just kind of lay on the floor and watch everybody else go around 
yeah it was painful but no worse than 
going to the hospital for my back surgery my back surgery was worse than a heart attack ever was 
yeah 
uh i blew a 
out 
and i couldn't walk at all 
so they 
i have o s u insurance but i had no doctor at the time and they wouldn't admit me they told me they were going to 
make wait two months before they did anything 
and what i did i had my wife drive me down to the hospital i crawled out of the car crawled into the hospital and told them either admit me or i'd crawl out the door 
like i told ya i can be an idiot 
yeah and i told them i was going to call up the tv station so they could film me crawling out the door as an o s u employee 
being turned away 
and for some reason they admitted me then 
i 
hypertension when i had the first two and then   the last two i had 
now i got cardiovascular disease i still got one of my arteries 
about eighty percent blocked i got another one fifty percent blocked and i got a dead spot on my heart right now so when i exercise 
uh my heart slows down 
let's put it this way where i work at i work here at o s u 
this will be something good to get on your tape 
and they've got people over there where i work at 
that they will 
give them the days off if their cats are sick 
they will also give them let them work seventy five percent if they're sick i had a heart attack had to come back to work early because i was out of sick leave 
and like i said i've been here twenty five years and they would not even put me on first shift because they said it wasn't 
a good enough reason 
yeah 
until i threatened to 
sue them 
second and third i was working sixteen hour days a lot of times covering 
that's one of the reasons they weren't going to move me 
well my doctor told me my blood pressure would be better 
if i slept at night instead of staying up 
cause of your internal clock 
and i was trying to do everything and then also too they wanted me to go to therapy 
which was scheduled in the evenings i when was working and i couldn't even go to therapy 
when i threatened to take them to court 
and it took 
almost two months 
after that 
but i 
i had a note in 
before i had the heart attack 
i'd already had two heart attacks i had a note in that i needed to be on first shift or i'd probably have another heart attack 
and they would not put me on first shift then i had 
another heart attack 
put me in the hospital and then i had a  another heart attack when i was in the hospital 
and when i came out that's when i 
gave them another note stating i needed to really be on first shift 
and that's when they said no 
it's  
it's all documented 
yeah told me to exercise which i do told me quit smoking which i been trying no offense it's harder to quit 
uh 
yeah stay away from salts uh sodium and stuff like that 
pop uh coffee i don't have no problem there i don't drink coffee i drink a lot of pop though uh 
like pork products 
yeah 
yeah because i don't like vegetables my hands are going to sleep 
i don't like vegetables is what it is so it's real hard for me 
uh the exercise i do a lot of walking anyway and swimming and stuff in the summer so 
but 
in the winter is when you know i mean i don't exercise that much 
my bill collectors are the ones that scared of that 
it's like this 
what can i do 
yeah but you put up with that anywhere it's not just ohio state it'd be anywhere you go you know 
it's just like i said 
you get excuse me your assholes in 
they leave then you get 
either another asshole or somebody good you just wait until you get somebody good 
it's like you're doing interviews 
you might think i'm 
an idiot but you know what i mean the next person walks in the door might be real good 
but 
you understand what i mean 
you just 
you just keep going that's part of life you pick up something you learn it and you keep going 
well i 
i work with around mostly black people 
and 
it's a weird situation uh 
they're more prejudiced 
that i've noticed now than 
when i only worked around a couple of them 
yeah because uh 
they're more 
you always hear about my black ass my 
you know what i mean and stuff like this and i could give a shit 
you know what i mean it don't matter to me whether you're black or white it matters to me whether way you treat me 
like when i first got out service is when they really started affirmative action i was going to get a job in the trucking industry and they couldn't hire me because of that was when they first come down with a mandate that they could only hire blacks 
so i was shut out of the job market then uh 
that didn't even bother me i thought well fine 
i went that's when i got the job at channel four 
but uh 
it's like anything else some blacks use it for good some blacks use it for bad 
and if i was in the 
i'd be doing the same thing so 
you know what i mean 
i'm a veteran so 
i get points for veteran so you know what i mean 
everybody gets something 
you're a woman you're a minority 
right 
you're over me 
my supervisor's black my last manager at the hospital was 
black 
plus my supervisor over there was black 
my brother in law's black my other brother in law's arab my other brother in law's arab 
let's see 
the kids that i just kept 
taking care of for my sister 
in law 
they're all arabs 
the three kids i had living with me two summers ago were all black 
uh 
i did have a white kid my son living there and that's about it 
oh  there's a lot of racism 
a whole lot 
your little  
cliques 
it's like being back in high school 
you know 
but 

what's bad about where i work at 
it's not so much racism as 
whereas 
if you're my supervisor i'm just using as an example 
and i do something wrong 
they're going to come and ask you so no matter what you say 
it's going be law 
it ain't going come and get my story 
so that means 
if you're working with me 
and you screwed something up 
i'm the one that's eventually going get in trouble 
yeah but 
yeah 
well no they don't 
no i don't 
see that kind of racism at all 
basically uh 
it's just 
the talk and stuff it's not 
uh 
like 
you know what i mean uh 
i'm black i'm better or i'm white i'm better it's  
it's none of that 
no because like 
uh 
i work like i said my supervisor is a black woman 
and i get along good with her the 
the 
other woman that's an indian woman i get real along real good with her 
the other guy is a black guy i get along with him 
real good with her 
but my supervisor got a friend that's a black woman 
that works in another department 
now she will come 
and talk to her 
and dump all her work onto 
us 
and then she's the one that i will be hearing you know you don't know what they're like 
black ass and all this you know they're prejudice 
and all she's doing is yelling 
about being 
their prejudice against her 
what she don't understand that's her damn job 
it ain't my job i'm doing her work 
she ain't 
but she's yelling at everybody's prejudice against her 
and i got to sit there and shut my mouth and do her work 
yeah that's what i'm saying 
it's only a  
yeah it's only a couple people it's not 
of people i work around black like i said a majority of people i work around i get along with great 
i could fire them because they're gay i could care less 
the two girls that used to live across the street from me were gay they're still real good friends of mine live down in circleville 
guy across the street is gay i worked in a gay bar one time 
i was the only straight person in there every girl walked in there 
she'd come right to me 
no  
because i wasn't gay 
but you  know what i mean i 
could care less about gay people but like i said that 
was the way i was raised 
yeah my 
my way that i was raised if people burned you once that's fine they burn you 
twice get rid of them 
you know it don't matter what they are 
there was gays probably when i was in there like i said i 
could care less 
but 
i don't really know about how they should handle that because that's a weird situation 
but you know what i mean just because somebody is gay 
ain't going to come after me they know i ain't 
but you know 
you know that'd be like you know what the hell   
putting on some kind of gay raise to make you gay 
yeah 
there is 
do i 
uh 
well when they built the continent up on one sixty one it was almost all gay german village 
was almost all gay at one time 
uh yeah there 
there was a big gay you got what about 
twenty gay bars probably here in columbus alone 
you know that i know of because you can look in the lantern or some of these newspapers 
we read a lot of newspapers at work 
but uh 
there lot of gays but like i said they're just like regular people 
you know 
i'm not really am sure how to answer that 
i would say more conservative 
but i might be wrong because 
my answer wouldn't be that good on that 
question no offense but you know what i mean 
it's 
yeah 
yeah because like 
i think columbus is more friendly than most places 
you know like when i was out in california it was like they'd spit on you 
i was working out there 
well back then i was working at a cycle shop 
but i was in the service but i was working there 
yeah 
well at tennessee they're even friendlier in some places 
yeah 
you hitting on me get the hell away 
well see that's like my wife she said i would talk to the devil 
you know 
like i told her it's the way i was raised 
when i retire 
i'd like to move like to mount sterling or something like that 
i would like to stay right around columbus 
i don't like the way columbus is heading 
ah 
for a big city don't get me wrong you can get anywhere real easy in this town 
but when i say i don't like the way it's heading 
they're cramming so many houses and everything and apartments and stuff 
it's getting 
so congested it's that's 
what i don't like 
yeah i had a boat and i got rid of it because 
i will not even go up there 
go to hoover 
yeah 
what's really weird is 
where i live at i live right by  
right 
i don't even have city water and sewer 
i'm the only one on my side of the street 
i'm the 
only little one on my whole block 
they're build two hundred thousand dollar houses 
around me 
these people drive by look at my little house there in the middle of it all 
with nobody around nothing but land 
hey 
i don't know 
that's the way i am 
well see that's like a big thing you don't understand when northland 
shopping center closed down and all the 
where where i'm at 
they got so many of them strip malls like you're talking about with stores 
of them 
you know and then easton you don't hear much about that anymore 
yeah 
i've seen that 
yes but there we go again you know that'd be better 
there used to be a place in upper arlington on zollinger road when i was a 
kid 
it used to be called the arc 
you heard of the group the byrds right 
they came and played there one time that was a 
teen club 
like i said you have nothing like that for kids nowadays 
and at whetstone park they used to have shelter house in the summer they held teen dances 
every 
weekend 
yeah 
and in the winter 
they'd build big  out there where the casting ponds was let you skate they have big bonfires 
when you're done skating 
don't have nothing like that nowadays 
somebody would fall through the ice and they'd sue them 
yeah but they don't have it 
you know 
there ain't nothing else to do 
well back when i was a kid they had battles of the bands at the mall 
northland mall would host battle of the bands once a month 
veterans' memorial would have it valleydale had uh 
of the bands and stuff like that you know places where kids could go 
well 
i just like because its smaller 
and i like the area it's pretty flat down there and plus see southern ohio's got a  lot of good places to fish 
so that's 
mainly it's probably more for 
fishing 
because i like johnstown 
better 
if you really want know but there isn't many places to fish up there 
well is that good enough 

okay 
do you want to know where i was born 
alright i was born in boston 
uh lived there 
but  i moved away before i really even remember it moved to detroit 
uh when i was there i spent 
about ten years there then moved to ohio 
uh with my family of course and then 
right now 
uh 
i'm uh 
at ashland university 
but i'm thinking about 
coming to o s u that's why i came down for the summer because i have friends down here so i'm taking a look at it 
so basically 
that's basically geographically where i've been 
uh yeah my parents live in akron 
uh like north of akron cuyahoga falls area 
but 
like i said i my uh 
i had apartment down there 
but like for the summer i'm down here so 
i'm a transient always moving my stuff 
uhhum 
it's a real boring boring town 
i feel 
i feel like uh i have friends and when we say oh we're going out to the bar like we all know which bar because there is only one that college students go to and then 
so 
no no um 
there's a few townie bars but college students aren't real welcome there 
so 
yeah basically for the entire summer 
and then if i like it 
ah 
i will be 
i will be enrolling 
so 
no my roommates are i'm just my mom wanted me to but 
i 
uh the way it  right now i'd just 
and rather work 
earn money 
yeah well actually i uh do silk screening for t shirts for my 
like 
for 
um 
like on the side for myself like 
to generate income 
and then 
also  
as of 
monday 
uh i'm working 
at ohio  it's an environmental group 
i will  
be doing canvassing type stuff just basically going door to door 
sign this petition 
stuff like that 
yeah yeah it's uh 
three hundred fifty a week 
for forty hours 
but i like the hours more than anything because it's two to ten 
so i can sleep in and 
yeah exactly in the middle of the afternoon yeah 
that's that's gonna be a problem they said bring bring water 
you're gonna definitely like they have no dress code which is nice so i'm just gonna wear shorts 
some good walking shoes and in a t shirt because 
it could get rough 
he could get real rough i bet 
um well 
actually 
i wanted to learn more about it i felt like 
like i really 
have no passion towards it but i thought this would be a good way to learn about it and maybe pick up 
like uh 
some ideals 
ideas about it so 
i figure it's something i should know about so 
like uh right now their biggest campaign is uh 
the  
some elementary school i believe 
or no 
i think it's a high school in marion 
was built on um 
an old 
weapons depot and so like leukemia has rise and 
so like that's uh their main campaign now is to inform the public and 
try and uh get that changed 
they have also done other things ah 
other uh they do anything 
dealing with the environment 
uh like 
exposure 
uh things like that 
so 
it's for the entire state 
and so this is just the columbus there is columbus toledo dayton 
i don't know any others 
no 
not at all 
there's not much in ashland 
yeah 
exactly 
pass through it 
random jobs for 
yeah like when i do the silkscreening in this is kind of random but 
just anything 
that'd be great 
i would do it definitely 
i'm living over on iuka 
uh if you 
on the other side of high street you know the mcdonalds right by high street it's like 
back there a block 
so it's 
right near 
like lot of other student housing 
uhhum 
yeah i am just learning the area so 
but i like it so far it seems really nice 
and uh 
ah it seems like there's a lot more to do in columbus obviously 
but 
my mom teaches there 
so it's free tuition i get a tuition waiver 
so 
and i figured i have a hundred 
up to a hundred and fifty four credits 
and so 
i'm to i'm up to like ninety four right now and i figured that would be a decent 
i mean it translates over because we're on semesters 
it will 
get all messed up there but 
it's like 
i'm 
half way to three fourths done with uh with my degree so 
if i wanted to transfer now would be like because i after this point if i stay any longer 
a lot of the credits won't transfer over it would 
be a waste of time 
because most places don't like to take more than half 
so 
that's why i just figure right now i should look 
yeah exactly exactly 
no it 
uh like i'm a business major and i hear the business school here is pretty good 
so uh i wanted to take a look at that and my roommate is a business major so he he was going to show me around the they have new buildings i guess 
so he said he would show me around there 
uh 
also i 
i really do like i came down for few games and things like that and 
i like the enthusiasm that people have for this place like ashland is so small 
there's a select group that has enthusiasm 
but 
nothing like here i mean this is 
everyone is just enthusiastic about the university and 
there might be things they don't like specifically about the university there uh 
i 
you don't hear  any 
like 
like universal negative things about this 
about the university ever 
yeah 
i hear 
yeah it's ridiculous i mean 
plus its a nationally recognized school so a degree from ohio state 
i mean you could go anywhere in the nation someone's at least gonna recognize because it's big 
it's big big name ashland it'd be more of a sell i'd be like okay we it's small it's private it's accredited 
but still 
yeah it's really expensive but that's why i went there for now 
i wouldn't go there it was actually my last choice 
uh for universities but i went there 
because the price 
it's in in education it's it's top they produce a lot of graduate and undergraduate 
uh 
education 
business school is coming up 
like they're building a new building but by the i will be gone by the time it's done if i decide to stay 
so it's it will be 
so 
as far as uh education like for small school and they just opened up their phd program in education 
and they're also known for political science 
but it's a real conservative political science 
it's a real conservative school and that doesn't really 
match my 
my views on a lot of things um 
like they it's dry 
they have uh 
real strict visitation policies things like that 
my thought is if you're 
if you're 
if you're considered an adult enough to move away then you shouldn't have 
that many restrictions i can understand some because 
i remember when i was a freshman in college it was 
we did crazy things but still 
oh yeah 
yeah 
very much so 
yeah it's a 
you can if you're if 
you can't go to a girls dorm 
until   i think maybe the afternoon 
i think maybe eleven i'm not sure 
uh 
but you have to be out by a certain time 
uh it's not as bad as like malone like i don't know if you've heard about malone they have like certain days so it's not like that but 
it's still just a pain 
you're allowed to have guests of the same sex like it   like 
i don't live in the dorms but assuming i did 
if i  if i had a girl come from home to visit me i'd have to 
either sneak her in 
and like just hope we didn't get caught or 
have her stay at a friends 
like uh at a 
girl friend's of mine 
a lot a lot of people 
yeah yeah 
so it's kinda 
and the university knows that's going on so 
they just 
i'm not sure really what they do 
no this real like to live off campus 
you have to well 
after my class it will be twenty two and senior credit status 
but my class was twenty one 
or senior 
or senior credit so i got to move off campus 
but like had i been a year younger i wouldn't have been able to because they have to wait until twenty two 
so they're 
yeah you're not allowed 
no it's very much so 
very much so because there's two thousand undergraduates 
and basically eighteen hundred of them live on campus 
and then if you live off campus like 
i'd like to think i don't have trouble making friends but 
like that 
but i've had friends get arrested by the police because 
after ten thirty 
like 
the university 
there's they're vehicles they 

of uh all the off campus 
kids to like 
to the police 
and so like 
they'd start driving around around ten thirty try and bust them for noise 
on the weekends 
so 
it's pretty hectic 
yeah exactly that's what it's a very conservative town and the 
and it's a very 
it seems to be a fairly conservative 
uh  
university as well so 
yeah i think if i make the transfer i will definitely be happy about it 
definitely 
like 
politically is that what  
oh well like um 
like i was in high school i was involved in like the democratic 
in the democratic campaign and 
just stuff like that just 
uh i'd like to do something 
i 
learning 
about the environment because this job 
but i'd like to do something 
otherwise like a 
a lot of like 
business leaders 
uh 
they're very 
they become very conservative when they get higher up because like the tax breaks they wanna support things like that 
but i think there should be a good mix 
like 
uh  
there there could still be 
like a think tank of 
of executives that 
could be very liberal and they're thinking and 
just 
you know for social 
for social 
not so much social change but 
you know not 
not um encouraging sweat shops within the corporations  stuff like that and i'd like to  
i don't know how i would get involved in something like that but i would like to 
it'd be interesting 
that would be neat 
that'd be real neat 
but 
that's 
dream world so 
i have to get a job and 
support myself so 
that will come later maybe when i retire 
way 
way in the future 
i don't know 
i would like to think 
i'd like to say no sitting here but you never know because 
i guess that's  cause that's what happens to a lot of them you know they  they come out of school all idealistic and then they go 
into industry and then 
they're molded and 
assuming they make upper management 
there's 
you want the tax breaks you want 
you know what i mean and then 
they uh 
like i have an uncle who's a vice president on wall street 
for merrill lynch and 
he said 
you know he 
he got out of school he was very idealistic but 
now 
he 
he's 
he's like all those people they should 
you know i'd  
i made it through myself and he's not for like the 
you know but 
realistically he didn't 
but 
you lose sight of that i think 
you know what i mean and 
lot of these guys become real 
egotistical 
i mean i like my uncle and everything but 
you know you know what i mean 
no not at all 
i think 
in the united states 
it's the driving force of our 
of our 
of our government and 
and even like 
cause  
without without 
a revenue base from the taxes 
of corporations 
the you couldn't have nearly the things that we've had 
and i think 
to a degree they've become 
fairly powerful but i don't think that's necessarily a bad thing 
uh 
when the unions were really strong i thought 
like we were 
i was reading about it i thought 
that was a good thing as well because that supported  
supported the person but you could 
if you have good relations with your labor 
you don't necessarily need a union 
and a lot times unions 
uh they  
actually seem detrimental 
like 
to production and 
to like the actual individual needs of the members of the union 
because 
the if the union becomes powerful you can feel free to call off and 
things like that and 
like 
that that can actually make it worse because then the corporation sees 
these lazy a lazy union as representative 
of 
of these workers so they're more apt outside 
yeah i was  
i was driving by the 
the honking and everything so yeah my roommates and got into a 
a debate about it 
but 
it 
we didn't really resolve it 
because 
conceivably they wanted 
uh what was it a two dollar raise 
or something 
but 
and then they also get free tuition but only 
as i understand it only 
a very small percentage get that free tuition 
or like 
exercise that 
that  
yeah 
like they all get the option but i  
i understand very few exercise it 
so 
you know if you were to not give them 
the the tuition that they could 
that 
most of them are using and then give them the two dollars an hour 
you know 
the but then 
that could 
then you could say that o s u's helping to keep people down and so you have to still 
it's a it's an odd balance there 
it is 
and 
like 
uh it's something like that doesn't seem too skilled to me so the i don't really know why there's much of a union for that but 
yeah 
obviously the 
yeah it does it's not like a skilled profession to me i think 
yeah the protection 
um hum 
yeah there's no distinction 
oh they were helping out the the new 
oh yeah 
but he has to still support the union so 
yeah that's 
that's a rough place to be in 
but a 
does the union like when people go on strike does the union help support the people that aren't getting paid then or 
oh 
i see 
um hum 
really 
yeah yeah that's 
that's interesting 
really 
broke the 
the 
strike 
if you're part of the union and you just decided to go back and say forget it 
they can't pay you 
yeah and i don't see too many people working for free 
so 
um 
in general i  
i think 
the united states has 
a fairly well developed like class 
not 
like 
class structure in which you can't move up or down 
but like 
we have a  
a fairly large middle class 
um sector and i think that's a good sign 
but i think 
there's 
a huge there's 
millions of children that don't have any healthcare and that's not right there's 
like 
there's a lot of 
like between the lower and the upper there's a huge disparity 
but 
at least it's a step in the right direction we have a 
a nice solid middle  
middle  
middle income base i think 
because a lot of countries only have the 
like 
i visited mexico and 
seems like they only had the distinction between 
the upper and lower i mean their middle class is very small 
and that uh but that economy is 
coming along too and i mean it 
it will be  
it's developing itself which is 
which is nice i took a tour of 
a plant down there 
cause my my old 
my old man had business down there so i went down 
just to see it and 
like 
it it seems like it was coming along and they treat their workers better 
granted those workers make the equivalent of like seven bucks a day 
but 
they get  they get bused into work because 
none of them have cars 
and then on top of that 
they all get a meal 
because 
there 
like 
like a hot meal like they have a cafeteria there because 
i was talking to the 
the  one of the managers and he said 
if we don't do that 
then 
they won't be thinking about the 
our quality 
and 
they will be thinking about getting food and they will be hungry so 
it hurts our quality 
so for them it was worth it and i 
i'd like to see that implemented something like that in the united states that'd be a neat thing 
you know 
because 
like 
i know like iron foundries and uh some like 
like the lower paying jobs 
like 
they have people that are illiterate and things like that 
and they can't 
like give 
paychecks out on thursdays because 
everyone will call off on fridays cause they all go out and get drunk or 
i don't know what they do with their pay checks i know that's a  big problem 
but like if you said i we will have a bus service we will go and pick you guys up 
you know and then then you can't use the excuse my car broke down or something 
and then like if you 
even you give them a 
like 
doesn't even have to be a hot meal i would think for breakfast or anything you know if you're on three shifts you can just 
you know here's the box of donuts and some milk or something 
you know that doesn't cost the company that much  
compared to 
you you will have more loyalty i would think 
and at the same time 
those people won't be thinking about being hungry while they're on the line 
working for you 
so 
yeah exactly 
you can bring that in house i think 
i mean 
i don't know i might go out like 
like we said and 
be 
completely wrong 
so 
yeah 

it's a qualitative type  
analysis 
exactly 
yeah they're very quantitative as opposed to like the quality 
and then so 
the analysis is all about bottom line and the numbers 
because 
actually that's why i don't like 
like i like business and i 
i enjoy my business classes but 
some of the people in my business classes i can not stand because they honestly they're like 
oh it doesn't matter how you treat people and then 
it's all about the bottom line well 
they will  
in my 
they will end up losing more because 
it costs a lot to hire a new employee 
and if you have constant turnover things like  
then 
and if you have a product and 
that 
because obviously people aren't gonna  
you know 
so 
and they they're they seem very closed-minded like 
like this is the way business has to  
but the professors don't seem to 
be necessarily like that 
maybe i'm coming too far 
going to one extreme 
but the professors seem more  
centered to me they're like 
you have to balance it which i'm sure is the truth 
you know you can't 
diminish all your bottom line  
you know making your workers 
good but 
there's still something to it i think 
yeah 
exactly 
see i'm not sure if universal health 
health care would be  
the thing 
i think it was 
my freshman year 
my sister and i went to 
donna shale the  
the  
whitehouse like 
on 
she's 
high up i guess i was  unaware 
yeah 
she she had a talk and my sister and i attended and 
i don't like the problem i think with universal healthcare would be 
everyone don't you think like everyone with the littlest scratch would go in 
you know  
as opposed  
like the very  
and  i think that could drive costs up 
so there has to be a way to balance it i'm not sure how you would go about doing that 
because you don't wanna 
a limit and say okay you 
only go three times a year 
because then you know what if something major happens that fourth time then what 
but 
i 
i at least for children especially because they have no  
to to help themselves 
and like 
the 
obviously 
even if they're working a lot of times can't get healthcare for their children 
so i think 
at least for children 
because how many accidents happen to children like 
people are always 
breaking arms and stuff 
you know and 
without health insurance that will cost a few hundred dollars 
and they have no means to help themselves at least if you 
assuming you're eighteen 
you 
get a job like 
and try and 
for your health insurance i mean it i'm not saying it'd be easy but still 
it's more feasible than 
a six year old 
you know 
so i think maybe 
not universal health care but 
for children i think it'd be helpful 
yeah  medicaid i think 
i think 
it  
it's 
they're always synonymous but 
but they're uh 
because they're both government programs but yeah 
but i 
like i said for the 
for the younger people because 
it is 
because it's not their fault their parents can't get 
health care 
so 
oh really 
oh really 
oh i see 
well that'd be a good way i would think 
yeah yeah then  
desire yeah 
yeah that seems good 
that's cool 
yeah that's uh 
the the bureaucracy 
it'd be too much of a struggle i think 
yeah but if you're the first state in the union to do it 
it  it will cost you  and millions it would be rough it be so hard to 
i know exactly 
you would 
but 
i don't know there has to be something like  you know the first state   that does it 
i mean  i after  one i'm sure others would follow suit 
it after they see the 
of it 
but 
that first one 
i don't  
and it would take  like years i would think to implement the programs successfully 
government doesn't seem to work too swiftly 
not that i've seen 
you know 
because 
honestly like 
gore to me is like a 
out of a bad bunch 
if i have to choose i will choose gore 
but that doesn't mean i necessarily like 
he's most in line with a lot of my  
with a lot of my views 
don't get me wrong i'm not 
completely liberal on everything like there's 
certain things i guess maybe 
because going to school in ashland it just rubs off on you 
i'm not so liberal about but 
i don't really 
like gore just seems so dry and just not 
it's hard to 
i 
it'd be hard to get people enthusiastic for him 
no not at all i would've rather voted for  
over bush 
because 
bush 
he comes from a political family which i'm not saying is wrong because the kennedys were a big 
political family 
but i'm saying like bush is um 
he just seems like 
he didn't really 
like  everything's been handed to him in life 
the issue of like whether he did drugs not that that's a big issue but i don't like the way he addressed it 
you know that to me 
if you did drugs okay everyone might experiment or try or make a mistake 
but the way he's handling it saying i'm not even gonna dignify that question over and over and over 
if he didn't do it he might as well just be like no i didn't do it 
you know because then what does he have to hide 
and then 
like the fact that he didn't know 
like i 
in international policy he will be struggling if he becomes president 
he didn't know the 
leaders of the world 
thing and then on top of it like 
texas is a fairly big economy but still like 
to manage an entire you know 
an entire economy 
i  
yeah 
and that 
like 
i 
that state's notorious for killing people i think they killed someone last night 
that to me is 
like 
that's ridiculous like the governor he could have made a stay or you know what i mean 
and they've openly admitted that they've killed people 
that 
were found to be innocent later 
yeah 
and it's like number one in the union and that's like 
such a disturbing fact to me that you could take someone's life and be like 
oh our bad 
that person was innocent 
you know 
definitely 
i definitely 
the way i feel 
the death 
wrong 
but  
i don't know 
are always like oh you know if your mother  if your mother was killed god forbid 
but like you would want the death penalty but 
honestly i don't think i would 
i really like i'd feel angry towards that person but 
killing them doesn't 
help  
with  maybe the families say it helps with closure and everything but 
i  that to me  
it's displacing my anger in a way that 
actually i don't think 
my victim that i was so close to me would want me to do 
you know 
so 
well like 
i'm a philosophy minor  
like 
if you look at like different 
ethical theories and stuff  
like there's a hierarchy kind of 
this is what i've found 
there's a hierarchy of 
things that are 
uh 
like the inalienable rights for instance 
like 
i can't 
if you come into my house 
and rob me 
and then run outside 
i  
like 
to kill you for stealing my property 
like there's a hierarchy there 
uh for stealing another life that's why people say oh you can do it so 
but i really feel like 
there's nothing 
like 
if i if it's inalienable the definition is 
it's not 
able to be taken not even by yourself that's why you can't commit suicide 
and since it's the highest thing because without it you can't even do the others 
it's so it naturally has to be higher ordered than the others because 
without that you can't do the 
you can't be 
ethical in any other  
so 
that has to be the highest thing 
and if it's 
inalienable because 
i didn't give it to you 
i can't take it back 
you never 
forfeited that 
you never gave me that right 
that's why i feel like 
i could  
want that in  
to kill another person or  
well yeah  
under certain  
yeah well  
uh we took  
uh i took  
military ethics 
as a philosophy course 
and that was really interesting because even though in 
even in that hierarchy 
there's still certain contexts within the context of war for instance 
if 
if we both  if we knowingly go into it as combatants 
and  
we're fighting for 
whatever cause but if we both 
are willingly going into it 

and we know that the result could be death 
then 
like 
and it 
and it's 
an  
an aggression thing one side will be the aggressor one would 
obviously 
because you can't have two 
uh 
two aggressive things 
uh uh 
naturally one would be aggressive 
and then one would 
be aggressive in it's response 
you can't you know what i mean 
so in like a state of war 
it was like that so 
in that context i think 
but like 
in the same context 
i feel it'd be wrong for a soldier to kill a civilian because 
they didn't 
um they didn't decide to become a combatant 
so if you're an 
if you're a combatant and you make that decision 
or your drafted which 
that 
that is kind of like making the decision in the sense that you are part of that society that got you drafted 
so if you choose to be part of that society 
that 
i mean that's a little shadier if 
but still if you're 
if you both make the 
the 
desire to do it then 
so 
like if i were drafted i think i would fight i'm sure i would fight for the country or 
you know 
but 
i don't think i would go 
you know 
i just don't feel the need to go 
on a 
well i mean 
to me the whole thing is wrong regardless of if 
you're guilty or innocent 
there to me there's   worse things 
i would think than 
than dying you know 
you 
like i know in israel the guy who killed yitzhak rabin 
he got locked up 
and he's not allowed to see  
uh because uh 
um 
under jewish law 
you can't kill 
for that for 
for that so 
he he got locked up and he's not allowed to see another human being 
like they have this they have like 
two doors and like they put his food there and then they close one door and then he opens 
and like 
could you imagine  
like 
no sunlight 
you know 
the and  they don't give him they keep it warm 
and he's not allowed sheets or razors 
or 
you know other than electric razors so he can't kill himself 
so you're just stuck  there's nothing you could do all day for forty years or however until he naturally dies 
and that to me would be 
like that to me is actually like 
that has to be worse 
just the agony and the 
and the i think you'd have to go insane like there's only so much you 
i'd ask for board games or something but like he  
doesn't even hear a human voice 
because  
i think it's something like that was written in the scriptures like 
you're dead to the world for 
uh  
is the worse that you can do and so 
the world 
sees him 
you know what i mean 
so that'd be  
that'd be real rough and 
so obviously he would want to um 
i would like they say like now like people that observe him he's like sings to himself and he 
reads the bible like 
everyday 
but like i don't know that'd be  
be such a horrible thing to go through i couldn't imagine being locked in a room for 
few days 
like that 
like solitary 
but like unlimited solitary that 
seem right either but 
yeah like it's just 
it's killing it's own citizens it's so 
yeah 
yeah exactly 
if you just look at the nature of what they're doing it's just 
inherently wrong to me 
yeah exactly that will 
that's just it's ridiculous 
you can get in huge arguments people like no you're lying because if your mother died or someone close to you died you would want them dead 
and honestly 
i can honestly say i would not want that to happen to them 
you know 
people can't  
they can't fathom that 
exactly 
they cannot understand where you're coming from 
yeah not not for special conditions 
just universally it's wrong 
yeah that's what it is 
it's a marketing thing 
maybe at the 
under lying base 
exactly 
that's ridiculous it's like barbarism to me like 
ugh 
yeah and we're 
texas is supporting strong they have like 
i forget they have the 
like way more than like they dwarf any other state i think so 
that to me is not 
that's not admirable and then i   
so the 
one reason i wouldn't vote for bush 
plus i don't really feel like the 
the 
at a whole like at their 
political convention like 
in uh 
the last presidential election in ninety six 
they said one in ten of the delegates that were 
attending the convention were millionaires 
now granted i know more than ten people and not  
you know what i 
just feel 
that's not a good representation 
yeah 
yeah 
they 
they definitely struggle 
it 
they do some 
i i think 
to be that high up 
obviously 
you're gonna come in contact with powerful 
people and 
things like that but 
i think at least even if the democrats 
do have that same 
thing they seem to keep more in mind 
i don't know i don't think they represent 
working class 
you know 
guy either but 
at least more so than the 
so like i said best out of a bad bunch i'd probably 
yeah 
so 
i think so 
and like 
they just  neither of the candidates really seem like they have that much integrity 
me you know 
so 
i have no idea i remember where i was too when the columbine shooting because like 
my friends and i we're sitting around drinking a few 
and 
you know we're channel surfing 
and you know we see that kid fall out of the window and we're like oh my god what is going on so 
we just left it on and 
it was quite 
like it was disturbing because 
i 
like i was recently out of high school myself and like sure there were fights and stuff 
like you could avoid them or 
know what i mean 
but now it seems like people are just 
like 
i don't know why that's a trend i mean 
my dad said 
uh he grew up in the bronx 
and 
he said even in the when he was in high school that they had 
they had police officers there so that's not like a new thing 
but he said 
you'd have people with like knives and you'd have people with fist fights but you 
like guns was unheard of 
you know and i think 
i don't know where this new trend is coming from i think maybe uh 
they're 
people feel dejected 
in high school i'm sure of it 
you know 
like 
i don't i  i didn't feel that way 
but 
i'd like 
in retrospect i look back and i thought 
you know i'm thinking maybe those people really felt like horrible and like 
if every day was like  traumatizing to them 
like that'd be so like for four years every day you're just like  or 
something like horrible and you 
like no one talks to you 
i'm not 
justifying what they do at all 
but i'm saying 
that would make them more 
that would probably in their mind give them the reason 
to say you know what i'm sick of this i'm gonna shoot those 
but 
i 
yeah i mean getting a gun doesn't  i mean i was surprised like 
i would i've never owned a gun 
but 
i think it's pretty easy to get one 
yeah so 
yeah and a lot people turn eighteen when they're in high school so 
sure they can 
go get one there 
that's just ridiculous too 
but 
yeah that's to me that's really weird 
i don't like i said i don't know what they're  
what they're thinking 
it 
their thought process was but 
i'm thinking maybe 
it the social because a lot 
to me a high school is real social 
and like the social aspects of it were 
problem 
so 
like i know uh like i was a 
four year member of student council and like did that  went that route in high school 
and i know we always tried to involve other people 
but like they would look at us and be like that's so lame i would never do it 
so like 
it's like 
you had these warring like 
two different camps the 
you know the camp that gets enthusiastic and 
and that's where i was and then there's the other camp and i'm sure they have 
their own 
hierarchy their whole structure and like 
you know they do things their way 
while  while pooh-poohing everything and saying this is dumb and stuff 
as far as bringing the two together like 
socially 
i think that's just a rough age 
you know because  
you're learning more about yourself 
and uh 
you're  you're also learning more about 
like you're 
a lot of freedoms that you didn't have obviously 
you know 
you're driving 

you have to go to dances you have to do that whole thing so 
i really don't know how to how 
how they would go about doing that perhaps 
like i know we used to have like uh 
we had 
like the administrators actually allowed us to have 
ah 
a day where 
everyone like the whole class 
as 
class could go have a picnic 
like in the practice football field and that was cool because 
everyone got along those days 
you didn't have to go to class you know you spent the second half the day 
hanging out and so everyone got along that way and i think that would be a start 
you know 
but then 
that hurts 
the  
the  
the administrators in a sense that 
they're there to provide an  
education 
so 
it'd be rough 
in like my high school 
they 
they put up  
they locked  
at certain times you couldn't go in them and 
like it was getting 
and they had like we were on the front page the akron beacon journal 
because they had a lock down where 
no one was allowed to leave their classroom 
and then 
they brought this 
the dogs  
they found 
i was surprised they found a lot of drugs 
and 
i wasn't real 
i was more surprised that they found a lot of  
alcohol like i wouldn't 
like 
you know like some people 
if they do drugs at school and stuff 
i'm not saying that's right but 
they will 
they will do it but like 
alcohol it'd be so hard to like hide because it 
you know and you 
hold it out but they found like bottles of  and 
stuff like that and i think they even might have found like one or two 
so 
and that to me was 
but my high school is two thousand people so i guess 
by sheer numbers 
one or two persons would bring a gun 
um 
it's considered 
urban 
but because it's north of akron we play 
a lot of like 
the 
inner city like in akron schools 
but in my opinion it's suburbia 
like 
but we have the we have the big city problems like 
there's a lot 
drugs 
and  i think that's just because 
the building's old so no one really takes pride 
it 
and then 
it's two 
people 
so that 
like the just the sheer numbers of it i think 
i  i  like if you had to ask i'd say i was a straight  mid western suburbanite 
but 
there are people that i go to school with 
and ashland is twenty five thousand 
like 
in the city 
and they 
they say that's a city 
and 
my school 
or  
where i grew up was 
more than double that 
just over double that it was like sixty thousand 
and 
cuyahoga falls 
and to me that's considered suburbia 
so 
and to me ashland is considered the sticks i mean 
there's  there's amish buggies that go by 
but like to some people that's considered a city so i think it's you're perspective 
sense 
for fun 
we've been playing a lot of pool 
a 
pool 
actually 
uh we go to a bar 
called the out r inn 
because it's cheap and 
it's fun there 
uh 
out r inn 
is over 
i don't even know 
i know how to get to it like the way we walk but i don't know what street its on 
yeah it's real  it's like the one of the closest bars and we go there because they have a huge patio 
and so you can just sit out and 
talk and 
and then uh we play a lot of board games lately too 
like we just bought axis and allies me and my roommates 
so it's really weird because uh 
it's it's kind of a fun game 
it's just strange because 
uh 
like 
we're on  
i came down in semesters so there was still a month 
where everyone was down here 
and now there's like 
nobody down here so it's 
myself 
my two roommates and maybe 
a handful of like 
other people that we know 
so it like 
the social aspects like 
is 
has diminished a lot 
but that still i mean for fun we uh 
play a lot of video games do like i guess you'd think  the natural 
like 
things you would expect from a college guy 
go out 
try and hit on girls that doesn't work that type of 
yeah just get out there and have fun 
and then like we lift 
uh probably like four days a week i know i don't look like it but 
but i go with them and have a 
time 
so 
yeah yeah it's uh right around here like 
it's like down the hill kind of by the  
yeah 
yeah so that's where we go 
and 
i don't have a student i d so i just sneak in but it's the summer they don't even care 
they never 
i look like a college student that would go here so 
i've never had a problem 
so we go and 
that 
and like we're planning a road trip we're 
we 
we're not we haven't decided we're thinking atlantic city 
or uh 
florida 
or new york city 
new orleans those the choices we're trying to narrow it down 
i know 
yeah 
you know 
when else 
at this point in my life when else would i be able to do 
so 
uh maybe 
maybe i like i said like 
it's really weird 
most people make fun of me for still wearing detroit hats and being a detroit fan because i've lived in ohio for so long 
but 
when you're little is when  
i think you learn loyalty like i love the 
old detroit tigers from the eighties 
and like 
that's when i learned 
to like 
baseball like i collected baseball cards 
i lived in detroit and so that's why it like stuck with me 
so like i uh i remember when i had my tonsils out 
in third grade like you're allowed to bring one item because like you're a little kid 
to like make you feel better 
and i brought my detroit tigers hat so 
i i  like i will only wear detroit or boston and boston just because i  
uh was born there 
but 
and like people make fun of me they're like you know because detroit's horrible they're in last place 
they're like why don't you pitch 
you know be happy for the indians i'm like i'm 
for them that's fine but 
oh yeah 
yeah 
oh you get your 
well that's 
yeah yeah 
equal distance 
they're definitely 
i thought they'd be a lot 
they got they picked up 
ken griffey and then on top of it 
they   they were good without him 
and now they picked him up and they seem to be  they still struggling i'm like 
i don't understand that 
yeah but the indians are horrible right now 
i like i watched a game yesterday 
and 
they were  
i think they were few days ago seven and a half games back from the chicago whitesox 
we watched the game yesterday and 
i don't know if we have a lot of injuries or anything 
i don't really follow the indians but 
the  like i couldn't even recognize like that many of the names 
like 
to me that was very strange 
yeah 
that's that's pretty much out there 
yeah they definitely have the sticks 
definitely 
yeah they 
the 
the big sticks are definitely 
those two teams 
it seems that way i don't know why that is 
you know in the eighties 
they had 
a lot of games were like 
one to two 
you know 
shut-outs stuff like that 
now i mean 
he 
my roommate was telling me the yankees beat someone twenty one to something the other day 
and that's ridiculous 
that's 
to me 
i know yeah i know it's ridiculous i'm just 
i find that just 
yeah it dilutes 
there's there's only so much talent so it dilutes it 
and that that makes sense 
and a lot of the new ballparks are made smaller 
so they can hit home runs because that attracts fans people go nuts 
people would rather see a 
tight game that was like 
seven to like six 
rather than watch like uh 
a two to one ball game 
because that's more boring 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah yeah exactly last three outs everyone's like yeah let's hope he does it but until then you're like 
okay this is ridiculous 
yeah 
all right 
no 
no i think 

yes 
uhhum 
uhhum 
i'm working here uh 
um 
but 
working 
um work study 
so it's very part time 
and 
i 
am full time student 
so 
i was working somewhere else before but it 
it was 
i needed somewhere on campus 
to be close so i didn't have to drive 
i'm a senior and i just started 
my art 
major 
in spring so i still have about four quarters left 
but i am a senior 
well 
altogether i've been 
i started in ninety one 
that was 
winter ninety one 
and 
i went to columbus state 
and i 
had 
just 
there's a few years that i didn't go here 
and then so i came back so 
altogether i don't know how many years it's been but 
twenty 
seven 
i will be twenty eight soon 
august 
it's pretty soon 
i keep thinking i'm twenty eight now so it must be coming up 
may as well just get used to it 
wow 
clintonville 
uhhum 
no now 
i live with my husband in grandview 
and 
i've lived in all different parts of clintonville 
but 
uhhum 
uhhum 
except for a year and a half i lived in russia but 
that's 
wasn't really living  
i was 
actually serving a mission for my church 
so 
southern russia it's the 
um near 
um 
like 
khazakstan and 
i mean not really near but 
relatively it's not close to moscow 
yeah 
it's russia 
in the ural mountains no not 
i don't even know 
that is that's pretty terrible but 
i don't think it is 
yeah 
i think it is further east than 
where i was i was right in the ural mountains so it's like the 
border of europe and asia 
uhhum it was pretty 
the city actually had a million people  that i lived in most of the time 
but it was 
the government that ran it actually was still 
um 
communist 
they weren't they're not really 
acting 
they are the government there 
but 
they  
it's just all so messed up it doesn't really matter who's 
the 
it's whoever wants to 
um it was just 
yeah i guess the mafia was a big problem 
they just take over everything and they 
they don't pay their workers and 
most people aren't mafia so they 
don't get paid 
uhhum 
yeah this was  
three years ago 
about three years ago in august it will be three 
and 
yeah it was 
however many 
was that in eighty nine or ninety or something like that 
well 
it's 
it gets more and more 
um 
like  
it's not like america 
but 
more and more like a  
regular democracy every year 
i mean 
not really but 
it's closer and closer 
a little bit 
it  
it wasn't easy 
and 
at first it was probably a lot harder 
then after you've been there 
for about six months and you start to just get used to things 
but 
i 
i took for granted 
coming to  coming back here was 
it was so amazing to be 
back in 
seeing all the 
nice things just 
everywhere it's just 
i couldn't believe it 
but now it's  easy to take it for granted again just 
oh i'm back home 
well i was 
with 
um 
i'm 
mormon so 
we i don't know if you have ever seen how 
they go two by two always and 
i was with what we call another sister i was 
and we would live in an apartment 
and 
we 
would pay for our own mission and 
there was a mission president 
and they had different people 
with responsibilities 
leaders and 
they would watch over you and make sure you know call in the 
every night and check on you but 
it was really 
up to us what we wanted to do we were 
we'd get up 
leave at nine thirty and 
be home by 
nine thirty or whenever it got dark 
and 
we could do 
what we wanted 
yeah 
i mean we had goals certain things that 
like we 
we had a set 
where we'd like to do four hours of service every week 
we'd 
like teach 
english to little kids or 
or help clean or 
work at libraries or 
different things 
oh wow 
oh did you really 
uhhum 
it might have been where the president lived 
they sometimes have like a mission home 
yeah 
especially the guys 
just 
yeah we had um 
any 
not really just 
modest dresses you couldn't wear pants 
and it  
dresses couldn't be ankle length 
they couldn't be 
um at the knee 
had to be mid  mid  
mid 
knee 
or whatever that is calf 
and that was 
certain restrictions but yeah i mean basically just modest 
whatever 
i mean i wear 
boots with a dress in 
i don't think you'd do that here 
i think so yeah like their haircuts are a certain way and 
can't 
you have to shave and 
um you always have to have your tie 
and 
your jacket if you can 
unless it's really hot 
there's  it's different 
also depending on the climate 
some places you're allowed to wear sandals 
and 
right 
yeah 
right 
just  
i think it's uh 
a  to reflect 
the 
the 
uh um 
beliefs 
that 
we're trying to  carry and 
and 
because 
i think if someone showed up and looking like 
i mean i'm not saying that it's terrible it but if they had like a nose ring and all this stuff 
then 
it 
somebody might 
believe that they have anything credible to say 
and 
a lot of times if you're dressed 
more respectfully that to 
you know 
i mean most the people will accept you 
if you're dressed 
in a dress 
whereas 
i mean even a person in a nose ring will  
will respect you but 
but then you're in a 
you're at a  disadvantage if you don't 
dress in a certain way 
yeah 
right they look at 
more what you have to say then 
your clothes and that that was  
something i remember them talking about too 
you don't want them to look at what you're 
what you're wearing 
and 
that's mostly 
that was a good 
thing for the dress code just 
well not really they uh have a lot of 
um 
religious beliefs 
on their own that they've had held on to because 
um they have just have had nothing 
they weren't even allowed to  believe in god 
right 
so a lot of them already believe and that 
they have their own religion 
and they 
they're really faithful 
so that was the  one of the main problems is that they 
um 
they had been so 
holding on to that for so 
long and it's so strong 
they don't wanna 
let go of 
what and then the men 
their problem was usually that they would drink a lot 
and 
so 
the it 
it was hard to talk to drunk people 
uhhum 
yeah they're russian orthodox 
same 
basically same thing 
yeah i don't even know what their 
holidays are 
i 
i don't know 
uhhum 
like  
oh from mormons 
well 
our basic 
um 
real fundamental belief is that 
the church that the 
russians believed in at one time was 
the true church and that it was 
um 
the 
the same church that christ set up 
when he was on the earth 
with the twelve apostles and 
and but the 
after christ died that 
the 
authority 
was taken from the earth 
to 
um have those 
apostles and to 
have the 
the church set up like it was 
and 
it  
must have been really strong because it's still lasted all the same catholic and  all the orthodox churches still carry 
all these beliefs 

but 
our belief is that 
it didn't 
it 
it needed to be restored 
and we believe i don't know if you've heard about joseph smith 
or 
well we believe that 
um 
that revelation 
that was there on earth 
was 
actually restored 
again and 
through joseph smith because he 
had 
a desire in his heart to know what was true and he prayed 
and he actually had a vision where he saw 
god and 
jesus christ 
and i know this is all really 
i mean this is like deep doctrine stuff but 
and um 
and he was told that there were  
none of the churches on the 
earth were true 
that 
some of them had good things but they 
their um 
they weren't exactly hitting the mark 
and 
that 
it was gonna about to be restored again 
and so we believe that the true church is actually restored again to the earth 
and it was through joseph smith and he translated 
the book of mormon 
with 
help from god 
and so that's basically it 
i mean the book of mormon is 
a counterpart to the bible 
it's a 
it's 
from 
prophets that lived in america 
so you knew you've heard about that probably 
oh okay 
it's easy 
to  
uhhum 
it  it's 
it's american in the 
from the fact that it's 
um 
it was written by 
native americans 
and 
and um 
and joseph smith was an american 
and he was 
used to 
to translate it so it is 
and it it's actually funny though but  
more members of the church that live outside of america 
it's 
gotten to the point where there's 
there's 
more than five million outside 
less in america then  
that's exactly what it 
yeah 
oh 
there was a lot of discouraging things 
just 
i mean 
i learned so much 
it  and it wasn't always just people rejecting you that was discouraging because that was kind of funny at times 
people would 
on the door and they would  
yell that they weren't home or something and 
and so 
it was kind of funny but 
but the 
discouraging i mean it was discouraging when you see people that don't have any 
hope and 
they get so 
they're just so poor and they 
and 
and you  i  
we felt sometimes like 
we could help them but 
they didn't want any 
help and 
it was kind of hard to 
just 
say okay well 
i did what i could and 
i mean 
not saying that they had to believe what we believe but just 
even just 
the their attitude about life was so 
down and 
yeah 
they were just so 
there was other things 
right yeah 
like we had our service we'd clean up 
neighborhoods or 
yeah there was a lot of different things 
uhhum 
no i think they liked that 
it  it was really funny because here if you went into a 
a 
school or something and said 
we wanna 
help 
we wanna teach a class 
or 
we wanna clean or anything 
they would probably say 
you know they might think it was kind of weird but they 
would 
let you 
you know 
but they would be like you wanna do this and we don't have any money to pay you 
oh but we don't 
you know we don't want money that's the whole point we're  
we wanted to serve you 
mm they  they didn't get that at all 
they were like 
some people would just be like no no way it doesn't make sense 
probably a little bit 
uhhum 
there is yeah 
it'd be a lot more accepted i think here 
even though it might be kind of 
i wouldn't do that um 
on my own but 
if i'm 
i felt like 
that was what i was doing all the time so 
full time 
oh 
i think 
the 
one of the things that we 
when when you're baptized is that 
you're really 
supposed to 
help other people to 
like if 
if  somebody gives you a gift you wanna give it to someone else 
but it's 
easy a lot of times just to fall into the 
you know like 
mold of 
not letting anyone know what you believe and 
just 
so that they 
think well what are those weirdos you know they don't wear makeup or whatever but we  
we can wear makeup if we want 
but 
so 
i think 
a lot of times people do fall in 
to sort of 
but i 
i was not raised 
mormon so 
i have a lot of 
my family and friends who are still not members of the church 
and 
also because it's so new to me that 
i 
am just 
you know i will talk about it with anybody and 
and 
and so 
and i'm also 
not afraid of people who aren't mormons because i think if you grow up like 
a member of the church and 
you might be  
more afraid of people 
that don't 
believe like you've been taught 
i think 
a lot of the 
you know 
we don't 
drink alcohol we don't 
there's a lot of restrictions 
i guess you call them restrictions but they're 
i feel like they're more 
just health codes 
just keep you healthy and 
so 
um 
it might be 
it's like if we  
america 
you know we're 
we're used to being raised one way if we went to another country just kind of like 
you might wanna get to know the chinese people but 
you might not quite 
be a little timid about 
you know  kind of thing 
but 
i 
i'm not i don't have any of those barriers 
since i've been 
on both 
worlds 
well 
and 
and it really isn't though because 
once 
because 
i think it's actually it's really freeing not to have to drink and 
all these things so you just kinda 
i feel like i can get along with any 
people 
and 
so it doesn't really exclude you from anyone 
unless you would 
let it i guess 
and nobody's 
perfect i mean everybody has their prejudices i guess and fears so 
getting over that is a 
is 
part of life 
for 
uhhum 
no they were from all over the world i had 
um 
one 
companion 
who was from 
russia but she was 
on a temporary mission 
i 
uh mostly 
all over america but 
there was a girl from mongolia 
um 
there was 
girls 
there who 
i never was companions with them but they were from russia 
different 
mm there was a girl from moscow 
um 
my mission president was actually from saint petersburg and his wife 
they 
they didn't speak english 
you just get 
sent 
wherever 
uhhum 
it's 
it's funny because i had studied russian but a lot of the people i served with were 
fluent in spanish or something else so 
it's like 
i don't know why they got sent there but 
it's 
i 
i mean we  
really believe that 
there 
that it's inspired they send 
our 
your name and a picture and your 
application 
to the 
prophet who is the head of the church 
and 
um 
they 
pray over 
it and they 
decide where you go 
so 
it's 
and sometimes it will take a while to get your 
call what 
they 
we call your calling 
or your call 
but then you just it's exciting to find out where you're gonna 

uhhum 
uhhum 
that's how i feel 
that's that's what i 
i choose to believe that 
oh 
yeah it is 
no no no it's not 
you can do whatever you want 
there 
uh i've heard conferences where the  
um i've heard the prophet talk about how 
you should  
keep in touch with the people that you 
served and 
or the people that you worked with and that you knew and 
and that they 
even if they can't  
you can't remember how to speak just try and 
send them a  
i've been really 
about that so i feel 
a lot of pressure to 
i need to 
i mean it's  
i just don't wanna lose contact with them 
because you 
get these great 
friendships and 
but yeah you can 
there's 
i know people that have 
married people from their 
i mean that's really not supposed to happen while you're on your mission but 
when you you know when you're done if you 
wanna go back 
um 
is that happens too 
but it's really not 
looked 
i mean you shouldn't 
that's against 
the rules 
on the mission 
um 
if the people wanna get married 
when they get home 
that's fine 
but 
um 
yeah that's 
it's 
it's another thing where you're focused trying focus on your work and 
you're not allowed to 
date 
never alone 
so 
and um 
but 
you can live where you've 
served you can do whatever you want 
after you're done 
okay 
i actually 
joined the church 
in uh well i don't know it was six years ago about six years ago 
and they did a survey here at o s u 
and they were  
um just asking people 
if they thought 
that christ had visited america and there was a record of that 
account if 
do i think that would be important 
and i was like 
well 
i think so yeah 
and 
but 
i didn't i was kinda hesitant 
i mean it took me a while to 
i 
read the book of mormon i really 
prayed about it and 
took me about six months 
and 
and then i finally decided that i really 
liked it and it was 
what 
i had been wanting 
so 
so that's how i decided 
uhhum 
no 
i don't think it was because 
i grew up 
just 
basic 
not even really christian just 
really 
not 
no real religion 
and i'd been going  to  presbyterian church 
as i was about nineteen years old 
looking for something a church 
i just had a feeling that i wanted to 
have that in my life 
because i'd never 
had that before 
and so 
i was just looking around and i was open to anything i had listened to 
eastern religions and 
i've listened to the jehovah's witnesses and 
and 
and then when i 
read in 
the book of mormon it's just 
i 
it's a feeling of like 
like 
i felt like 
i had heard it before 
and 
it made sense to me 
and 
and so that's why 
i really 
felt 
at home with this and that's 
why i decided 
no i never did i 
i don't know of 
many people that do but 
but 
it was 
also 
for me i think 
if i know something's true 
i just know it 
and then 
as long as it keeps on being true over and over again 
if it's not just some exciting thing that 
for one day 
oh this is great 
but like 
six months later it still has the same 
still ringing true 
a year later two years later 
then 
that's how i feel 
uhhum 
i read it 
yeah 
i do i 
and 
and if 
i read it 
every  
i try to 
and um 
and i 
we go to 
church i have all sorts of activities that i do 
and i just  
always feeling like i'm reinforced 
that 
it's not 
just some sort of 
flaky idea that it's 
for me that it's 
um real and 
and it it just  always makes sense 
that's important to me that i feel like it 
makes sense 
uhhum 
yeah 
yes 
it does 
definitely he went on a mission to texas 
and 
he's 
he's been back for a while he's thirty two 
well he will be thirty two in april 
probably it is you're right 
i 
i asked him what language did he have to to learn to 
yeah 
no he didn't either he joined when he was sixteen 
and he was catholic before 
and 
similar just 
kind of thing with him just 
having meeting the missionaries and 
uhhum 
yeah we met 
um 
at 
where we there's a singles 
ward 
where we call ward 
it's on twelfth avenue 
down here 
and 
it's just where all the 
single 
people under thirty 
go to church and there's 
dances and 
different activities and 
uhhum 
it's at 
it's at the same building actually it's 
it's 
it's used for different things 
yeah 
uhhum 
it's kind of frustrating 
but 
i'm 
i 
it's a  it's probably good for me because 
i'm 
so 
it's hard for me to 
just sit back and let other people 
believe whatever they want 
you know 
i just want to convince them but 
i can't do that 
so it's a good 
exercise for me i look at it that way and 
just letting them 
go ahead and 
uhhum 
but there's things that are 
difficult like 
there 
the 
where we go 
we 
we have a 
temple too 
and they can't go in the temple 
well they can but they have to 
fit 
fit certain 
criteria they have to be baptized and not 
and follow all these health codes and all the different codes and 
but 
that's not what they're 
interested in doing 
and 
and that's hard i 
think 
and like 
going on a mission 
really 
they didn't understand that they're my dad was like 
do they know how small you are they're sending you to siberia 
so 
they didn't know 
no 
they thought it was 
my dad told me later that thought i was 
getting sent off and 
just by myself you know 
yeah 
more like that 
right 
yeah right 
real war 
that's all right 
mm 
uhhum 
i think his mom was pretty 
you know doesn't really talk about it wanna talk about it 
he comes from 
his 
his 
real  
biological family is very 
um 
i don't know if guess you'd call it dysfunctional or 
they're 
um 
he didn't live with them 
after he was 
fourteen or so his 
it was just 
so bad that 
his mom couldn't take care of him and his 
his siblings so 
he was 
pretty much on his  
own but 
he was taken in by a family that was members of the 
mormon church 
and 
so 
mm basically they didn't 
legally 
adopt him or anything but 
they're the ones that he considers his family really 
and 
i mean he still keeps in contact with his 
mom and his dad 
but it's always kind of a 
they're just 
her she was drinking 
i mean terrible alcoholic and 
very his  his father was very abusive and they didn't weren't even married 
that he remembers 
he remembers the stepfathers and 
and that kind of thing 
it's just 
not good 
no it was 
his mom ran away is what happened 
yeah his mom 
couldn't take care of him anymore and he was like i think he was about fourteen and 
he just 
he didn't have really anywhere to go 
and luckily these families had taken 
his different siblings 
different families took them 
i don't know how they got connected with the church because it was all church families that 
took care of them 
but 
um 
it was good for him because he's got that example 
and 
so 
i don't know if there's any particular 
i think 
if someone knows 
if anyone 
knew of something like that going on they would 

in a heartbeat try and help them 
but they don't i don't think they 
make an effort to like 
put out any 
you know 
okay 
uhhum 
art 
drawing and painting is my major 
and 
i 
i um 
i like doing all sorts of different things they don't 
i haven't even had any painting classes yet 
so it's kind of funny i'm like taking sculpture and 
and 
drawing and 
next quarter i have a painting class 
yeah 
right 
uhhum i've  been into 
art 
in in high school i went to uh 
art 
like uh 
and i was 
for fine arts 
and 
i 
always 
wanted to do art 
because i can't do anything 
no it's 
mostly 
i'm i'm not good at  or i mean i could probably major in english or something like that but 
not math 
it's is the talent 
my husband's good at math so that's where i 
i'm grateful for 
uhhum 
i did 
well i never really 
think i had 
first of all i didn't have 
the 
motivation i don't think to put in the effort to do it but 
i don't think i had very good advisors when i was first here 
i didn't really understand the idea of 
that 
u v c was separate from 
art college and 
that you had to 
apply and 
i didn't really know i just like oh okay 
i just 
well but 
i didn't understand as much as you 
i just like 
like 
clueless as to what i needed to do to become an art major 
and i'd go to my 
advisor and they'd tell me what to take and it was the art 
advisor but 
i didn't really 
think 
i had to do anything special like i didn't  know about the portfolio review and all that stuff 
and that was probably my own fault for not 
asking questions but 
so it took me a while and and i just 
kind of 
went to columbus state 
and went on a mission then came back and 
so i just got accepted into that college 
but 
it's the art school 
year 
yeah 
it's 
it's a um 
probably about four years left 
i'm almost done with all my g e c's and everything like that so 
that's about done 
uhhum 
it's all 
i've learned a lot it's been interesting 
i've liked my classes 
well  i have 
um 
i've 
a have a 
different  
options i'm thinking i could either  an art teacher or have some kind of 
um freelance type thing to 
from my  
and 
i 
i really 
want to just 
um hurry up  
get done with school as fast as i can i 
we really my husband and i really wanna have kids and so 
we don't 
we don't wanna wait very much longer 
the some of the classes i'm taking are 
um 
kind of 
dangerous though 
like 
the 
fumes from the paints and stuff 
so 
i can't 
have to wait till those are over 
oh yeah 
stop yeah those are real chemicals 
yeah 
you still have to 
be careful and 
yeah 
so you have how many kids  
one 
well that's good 
that's 
oh that's great 
oh 
yeah i can't wait 
well actually he was i don't know if you've heard about 
the   
deal 
well he was one the teachers that 
um 
tried to start a union 
and was 
okay 
well he's he's 
yeah he taught math but they had a general curriculum was just like he taught 
seventh grade 
he gave him math science 
um 
supposedly social studies 
all the stuff that 
i mean it was just 
it was very poorly run 
to begin with so 
we would go out and 
try and find books for the kids i don't know if 
you heard that they he hadn't bought them books and 
so we had to buy them 
i mean they got reimbursed but 
it was just ridiculous 
so they were trying to 
do anything they could and 
just to keep their jobs and keep the school 
uhhum 
uhhum 
yeah it's supposed to be an alternative 
type 
to the public schools 
where they can 
hopefully get a little bit more of the discipline that they might have not 
gotten somewhere  
uhhum 
right 
education definitely 
and it's military 
so 
yeah uh he  
he and 
three other people 
well a lot of them had signed the union 
they have to have almost everybody sign 
for it 
but 
um he was one of the people that had really 
been 
yes 
and so 
he fired him but not for that because 
you can't do that it's illegal 
so he 
but he sent a form letter 
with 
everybody  it was exactly the same 
to the three people that were fired 
except for their names were changed 
for the 
these 
like basically made up reasons 
i mean he's uh he's kind of in big trouble they 
they're 
wanting to pull the charter on him and everything 
so that  
but he's gonna try and um 
keep the school open which is gonna be ridiculous 
uhhum  is his 
yeah 
but 
it's just 
it got out of 
i guess so 
i hope that they can keep the school somehow 
for 
the kids and 
but it won't be him running it 
well he's working part time at lazarus but really he doesn't have 
so i'm working 
yeah he wants to teach he's 
he likes football and he wants to 
coach football but you have to teach to do that so 
uhhum 
he was 
he 
did some assistant c a h s 
at uh 
o s u 
for o s u 
he really liked that 
uhhuh 
except for last year no i'm just kidding 
i i like to watch football i like o s u i've never really gotten into anything else but now 
he like he likes the um 
denver and 
so i will watch that with him 
but 
i don't really know much about it 
yeah that was pretty 
i think they 
i don't know what happened 
oh really 
oh you're kidding 
i do have some relatives that 
are um step 
my stepmom's relatives that are there 
they're actually members of the mormon church 
so that's 
i guess i do have some 
by marriage 
but they live near bloomington 
uhhum 
yeah i guess they do i don't know what 
where where it is or how many 
they have 
oh you do know 
oh 
you probably know more than i do then 
i never went there with them because 
uh um 
my dad's very against it 
uhhum 
he's episcopalian 
so 
did you really you went maybe even to their ward that's funny 
they're 
they're the  not that you would know 

yeah uh she might know 
her name's  she's um 
on the school board 
well i don't know if it's monroe county or 
probably 
that is what a small world 
oh 
wow 
it is that's weird 
um hum 
yeah 
need to pay the rent 
that's 
um yeah 
um 
me 
or 
oh 
well we  really wants to go he 
lived in california that's where that family i told you about was the 
and when he was  or sixteen 
and he really wants to go back 
so we will probably end up there sometime but 
after i finish school and 
after he works for a little while and i work and so that we can have enough 
money 
i mean we don't need to have a ton but we just should be 
least a little out of debt 
yeah 
something 
i don't know anything about it but  he lived in lompoc which is 
um 
i think it's near santa barbara 
but 
we've talked about l a i don't know anything 
heard terrible things about it but 
oh really 
san diego's probably why 
yeah i've heard that's 
a nice place 
that's nice 
yeah 
columbus uhhum i went to 
up in an alternative school system all along i  
i got into the 
lottery 
they 
i 
made it into every 
school i applied for 
so went to  and 
high school 
well i didn't necessarily want to 
my family started me out 
they um 
are alternative to the public schools 
um 
just  
i don't know exactly how to explain it 
the only thing that i know is that i never learned to do anything 
i never learned math 
we had in our fifth grade 
we had the 
principal realized that nobody knew 
times tables 
he had a big pizza party 
planned for 
so that if  if whoever won 
you know would get 
but 
we just went on field trips and had a great time 
it might be better 
was a guinea pig type 
situation 
it's probably better in high school as more college prep 
okay 
no that's fine 

once upon a time there was a gentleman named  
and he sat and he fanned himself because he was hot 
every time i fan myself it goes 
feature 
sorry i will stop go ahead 
doesn't matter when i clear my throat and you're listening to it it's gonna be annoying as hell 
yeah 
my apologies in advance 
we're getting more fun stuff all the time but predominantly it's still got way too much cowtown personality 
uhhum 
oh 
i live in albany therefore i'm cool 
i was born in new york 
and therefore i'm cool 
yeah 
since i was five that makes it twenty years 
went to 
worthington high school 
and 
in 
the end of my third year it became worthington 
kilbourne high school and thomas worthington high school 
and so i got to be the first graduating class of this brand new school that they built because the old one had just overflowed beyond 
all 
and 
we called it the uh the taj mahal 
because they'd spilled bunches of information into it 
or bunches of money 
and 
it was pretty 
it was fun to be the first class in the school cause everything is brand new 
uhhum 
cause they're so stylish 
what they should do is just tell people that their kids don't get to go to school 
i bet the attitude changes pretty fast 
but it's such a good idea did i go to ohio state yes 
yes 
i told you that earlier though but yeah it wasn't being recorded then so it's okay 
um 
well it started out as 
uh computer science under the college of arts and sciences 
but then there was this whole foreign language requirement and a bad incident with a counselor and eventually i became a 
a 
proud member of the college of business 
i had foreign 
i had french in the sixth grade 
and i got a's 
i had 
um 
german and spanish in the seventh grade 
and then the 
uh 
eighth grade 
i had french 
and then ninth grade 
i got 
um 
in the ninth grade i had french 
in the tenth grade i had french 
and 
my junior year of high school 
i had french 
and my  grades went 
straight b's 
straight c's 
d's 
straight d's and i said 
i think i should get 
taking it i didn't take french my senior year 
but then the arts and sciences came around and said you will have a foreign language requirement 
and i like well i already know all this french i might as well take  more french 
and a first year freshman 
year of french 
it was not fun 
my second year sophomore i started in for another year of french and 
about three quarters 
way through the year i realized that 
every day was all about dreading french class before and after 
i would spend  up to french class going no no french class then all after french class going god that was so  
i was like 
this is stupid 
this is no way to live my life 
so i went to my counselor i said 
no french class 
that's how it's going be see you need to figure out how i'm not going end up taking  we have to take a french class you have 
i was like 
no 
don't have to take a french class 
said well 
you have to take a foreign language you have to i said look i'm not taking any more foreign languages we're gonna figure out how to avoid this or 
no you have to take a  i said look lady there are sixty thousand students in this university 
and if you think that 
i'm going to believe for a second that they all take foreign language classes after having seen the college of foreign language 
you're insane 
there's another way to do this experience 
what is it 
you have to take a foreign language i said 
okay 
we're gonna change the question a little bit here you have two options now 
tell me how to avoid taking foreign language 
or tell me how to talk to somebody who isn't you cause that's apparently all i've got available 
said 
well you  to take i said how do i talk to somebody else 
she said well you have to talk to me 
as long as you're in this college 
i was like 
where's the  
so i became a proud 
business major 
no it doesn't 
mmhmm 
there are some um 
foreign activities classes or foreign type culture classes or foreign understanding 
yes 
there's 
an 
there's a feeble attempt to make you well rounded 
is what there is but there's no 
specific 
language  
it's curious isn't it 
yeah and as i got older 
to lose interest 
i don't have a bloody clue to be perfectly honest with you i just 
noticed that 
it continued to decline all through high school and i was like 
yeah you should get out before you actually fail the class 
and um 
it was 
it was just unpleasant 
i think i was stupid 
i think that's what it amounts to 
not that i was not able to pick up the data 
i was just 
um 
that's uh unwise 
in in whether or not it was worth 
while 
and i believe that it's uh 
horribly worth 
while now 
and yet now i'm not taking classes 
so 
at the end of march i go  
europe 
i travel around for a minimum hundred days with a backpack on my back 
and outside of english 
french is a 
horribly popular language 
for 
different countries to have as a second language 
so i think 
be 
extraordinarily useful to me now if i had a greater understanding of french 
reality strikes 
um 
wander around look at things 
talk to people 
yes 
minimum hundred days 
uhhum 
i had three months 
and then it got postponed then it got postponed again and i was like this is stupid 
in exchange for postponing it again 
my rationale was fine i will give myself another ten  
because it was also a nice 
like 
a hundred is such a pretty round number 
um 
i've a great employer 
and i 
i got hired in 
one of the opening lines in the 
interview conversation is hi i am  
and 
in this particular month i'm going to europe but i may or may not come back 
you wanna continue talking 
he said sure let's keep talking 
i said okay 
and then we continued talking so 
um 
it's up in the air 
i told him that he gets no guarantee that i will come back 
and 
in exchange 
i don't get health coverage 
while i'm gone 
to me and i 
okay super 
um 
my sister had gone a couple times 
basically took me aside 
and i have 
but one sibling 
and um 
it's 
it's fun to have a sibling because nobody is 
more similar to you than that sibling because they had to deal with the 
inanity that is your family 
for a long period of time 
but i imagine your sibling has a a similar world view 
perhaps 
in some 
oh 
my my sister's 
religious and that that 
tends to warp her view of everything 
in a fashion that 
makes it 
almost diametrically opposed to mine a great many times 
but at the same time 
the 
pre religion understanding of something 

is extraordinarily similar 
um 
so what she says might not 
might be diametric opposed to what i say 
but how she got there she started out somewhere 
is 
often so similar to where i'm coming from 
that once you 
filter it through something it looks different 
but previous to that 
yeah there's a lot there 
there's 
way too much shared experience to 
to gloss over effectively 
so when she said 
look if you never listen to 
anything else that i say 
you will listen to this 
you need to go to europe 
i 
was like 
okay 
i will go to europe 
oh yeah 
later 
next 
afterward 
mmhmm 
mmhmm 
london paris prague budapest amsterdam venice vienna berlin munich 
uh there's 
probably some more on there but that's all of the ones that jump off 
there's like a a 
a little hit list in my head obviously and 
another hit list in 
my palm pilot 
life is good 
can i just say yes 
i like lots of stuff 
um 
i like games 
predominantly 
i like 
i like playing 
um 
i like puzzles 
i like challenges 
i don't like jigsaw puzzles 
um 
i like 
anything that involves 
fixing it 
i don't mind breaking things either 
because then you have something to fix afterwards 
made me a very bad latchkey child 
i am 
uh i don't actually think that i i 
i could call myself an engineer amongst engineers but 
uh i think if i was calling myself an engineer to a psychologist it would be okay 
mmhmm 
mmhmm 
yeah  says 
double e major 
yeah 
i will just keep them as friends 
that works 
um 
i don't think it ever really occurred to me 
honestly i don't think it ever really occurred to me 
like 
hmm 
everybody else is taking double e's 
but i'm having fun over here doing this 
computer science thing and happy joy 
yeah 
maybe i should go back get a degree in 
electrical engineering that would be a lot of fun 
even if they don't pay me it'd still be fun 
so am i 
um 
i missed your question before that 
i play with computers 
um 
normally when people ask me i tell them what i did that day 
or what i did the day before if they ask me in the evening or 
so um 
what 
did i do today 
what i do today 
internet information server is a product by microsoft 
it lets you 
house web pages 
and put them out on the web 
index serve is another product that lets you 
put search engines on that 
um 
then there's another product by a company called splitcycle it's called net stock it sucks 
net stock basically goes out to yahoo and checks to see 
what the stock prices on something are 
and 
so 
i made net stock 
iis and index server 
all play nicely together today 
both 
um 
today i was farmed out to bank one 
i 
yesterday 
was monday i was farmed out to bank one 
friday 
farmed out to bank one but now i've resolved all those three issues 
and they don't have anything else to throw at me interesting 
so i'm leaving 
tomorrow i will be back at the home office 
working on some other stuff that 
will benefit us in franchising because franchising is 
a much better way to make 
money than selling time for 
for money 
selling time for money 
for money sucks 
mmhmm 
selling time for money 
yes 
oh yeah 
yes 
muchos money 
familiar with sarcom yes 
yeah but it's not a good way for me to make money 
if you're farming out 
people 
or if you're better still 
drop it down a level 
if you are exchanging 
hours 
for money 
or 
time 
for money 
then you have a finite amount of time 
and that sucks 
should have some other thing to exchange for money 
i would much rather exchange ideas for money 
or previously done work for money 
or something obnoxious and stupid like a franchise for money 
i'm in favor of that 
i come up with a good system by which to do things 
i sell it to you 
you go do those things 
i sit around and make money off of your efforts 
yeah that 
so 
sure 
um 
going into business for myself 
i need something to sell 
and selling my own time doesn't actually seem to be a worthwhile endeavor 
i've done it 
i've already 
done independent consulting 
wherein 
i set up a contract and said 
hi 
you pay me i will do this thing 
and i go do that thing and you make a lot of money like that 
problem is you get taxed obscenely like that because you don't have an employer paying half your taxes for you 
and um 
there's 
other bunches of overhead involved 
and 
there's 
the constant cycle of marketing oneself 
and it all depends on how much you wanna market yourself 
marketing yourself is 
easier for some people than for others 
and it's 
more fun for some people than for others 
so far i don't know if i 
it's a lot easier to market yourself 
beggars i love it 
mmhmm 
end of march i don't have a plane ticket yet i have a eurail pass though 
yes 
yes 
hi i'm approachable 
do do do 
bruge in belgium 
b r u g e 
bruge in belgium 
so i have a game going on with a good friend of mine named michelle 
i have this stupid ring here you see the ring 
so um 
i have lost 
something like two incarnations of this ring just flat out lost them 
because well ah i'm an irresponsible cuss 
and um 
one of them 
a third if you will 
i gave to her 
or more accurately i think she took it 
but 
it's a fine line 
and so she wears that around 
and 
replaced it 
so i had my own again i wear this one around so we have a competition to see who can get the most well traveled ring 
you get two points for every country 
and you get one point for every state or province within that country 
uh 
it counts if you're touching the ground 
or if something that you're sitting on is touching 
know 
well 
you  you get to take advantage of it 
for layovers and stuff it's 
it's pretty cool 
mmhmm 
i i don't hate all 
mmhmm 
okay 
well i'm not adopting that rule 
and 
fortunately the judge of our game isn't listening to our conversation so i feel kind of safe 
a mutual friend uh much better friend of mine than of hers 
but she's more attractive than i am so we figured it all balanced out 
we decided that made him unbiased 
mmhmm 
she has already been to europe twice sadly 
and has accumulated 
all of forty four thirty four points 
yeah 
and 
two for country 
one per state or province 
no 
no 
once you're in it you're been in it and that's it 
i have thirty two points 
belgium 
what do you think 
western europe 
netherlands holland 
doesn't know his geography for shit 
for the record 
i've already learned an immense amount looking at my eurail thing 
okay so belgium is  
okay 
okay 

belgium is it's own country 
i don't know where i'm going to fly into honestly i'm 
doing a courier flight 
mmhmm 
mmhmm 
town with the chunnel 
take the ferry from  london 
prague 
czech 
republic 
budapest 
that's the optimism yeah 
okay i have now dover 
and ferry 
what else do i need to remember 
okay now i have 
bruge 
ferry to 
i'm sorry 
dover ferry to bruge belgium 
and then train 
at that point i  to activate 
my eurail pass 
i teach a class on thursday nights 
how to play with computers 
um 
play games on tuesday nights 
i don't know  we vary it from one week to the next 
um 
role playing games 
under whatever system 
popular that 
day 
card games 
not usually fifty two card deck cards but 
other interesting types of cards 
or board games 
or 
just 
anything that happens to appeal 
is a 
group of five guys who know each other 
no 
some of them play at game stores 
i 
done it once and said eh 
it wasn't that good 
and continue merrily on with 
my day 
there you go 
i had enough 
friends who said to me 
can you make money with computers 
i said 
yes you can make  with computers 
and i said 
what 
could i 
with computers 
then i finally just said 
okay 
training people to make 
money with computers 
so 
none of these 
would 
well 
no 
some of these people would know what ebay is but probably only one or two out of like six 
so 
what we're talking an extraordinarily low level understanding of what computers are how they work so 
class one was demystifying the computer 
we took it apart 
we labeled everything inside i gave them all a piece i said put it back together 
we turned it on we saw if it 
worked 
we went back in figured out why it didn't work 
took it apart again 
this wasn't something can do hardware because hardware 
has 
no money in it 
but 
um it was so that they're not scared of the magic box 
and by the end of the first week or two they were no longer scared of the magic box and could continue to operating systems   
the goal of learning operating systems is real simple 
if you're playing with computer 
and you screw something up 
the worst thing you can possibly do 
is screw it up so badly that you have to start over 
starting over means 
putting a new operating system on it 
anything else 
is a hardware failure and you have to go 
fix it 
somewhere else anyway 
so 
if you know how to put an operating system on your machine 
you can start over 
if you can start over there's no reason to be scared of anything that you do 
problem number one in playing with computers for most people is being afraid that they're going to break something 
so once you convince people that there's nothing  be scared of here and there's nothing to be scared of there 
i mean and then they start to play 
and once you start playing you start learning 
if you can't play 
you won't learn you just sit there and follow my directions and that's dumb 
most of them are still sadly just sitting there and following my directions but they're getting better 
weekends i usually try and keep 
free 
so that i can 
make stuff up 
and uh 
i don't 
because of the usually the the one night a week that isn't 
horribly well scheduled 
wednesday nights are preparing for travel 
and you told me not to this that 
trying  stick to that sorry 
friday nights are date night 
because i become unpopular if i have 
like 
any time away from my girlfriend 
the more time i have away  
no 
no 
uh this is sherry 
so 
i spend time away from sharon i become unpopular 
and if i continue to do that for a long 
for long period time i become very unpopular 
so to that end we have 
a designated friday evening date night 
sherry usually tries to get 
all of saturday and all of sunday as date night as well 
sort of like an extended date weekend thing 
this is a game we play every weekend 
it's 
it's  
okay game 
monday night 
i usually 
come up with something dumb that needs to occur 
this 
was something that i would have done 
on a monday night 
for whatever reason 
yeah 
yeah 
girlfriend works for hell 
also known as ameritech 
yes 
center of all things evil in the world 
who would you go with 
and the other one is mcdonald's 
yeah 
uh she's in my class 
yes 
yes 
no 
no  
my i was born in new york i wasn't playing 
then went to tennessee with my family 
that was after  was six months old 
so i spent the best six months 
my life in new york 
yes 
then i was tennessee for  
a year 
then 
ohio 
and then back down to tennessee and back to ohio 
when was five 
and i been in ohio since then 
sixteen years  
uh mom and dad split up 
and sister move out to california 
in l a 
then 
over the next 
three years my sister comes back and forth 
now actually four years 
comes back and forth between columbus and l a i 
i live here for several months i live there for several months 
meanwhile i stay in 
ah columbus with dad 
i'm eighteen dad dies 
so now i am 
independent 
we have family in columbus 
i have my mother's family in mansfield 
so they're close but 
try to avoid seeing them except my grandfather who's 
a nice charitable human being 
the others are all nice and sweet and stuff but 
don't have enough rewarding characteristics to make me want to spend lots of time around them 
if i'd grown up with them maybe they'd have that thing going on that my sister has which is a bunch of 
shared mutual experiences but as it stands they're just weird 
so 
i'm drifting 
now you will hear me way too much 
was interested in going out to 
and i been out there several times but 
ooh 
it 
uh why wasn't i not interested in moving out with my mother 
at the same time 
no now it's on my chin 
get off my chin 
at the same time 
my mother and my dad split up 
i was 
just about to start my second year at worthington high school 
so i'm about to start my sophomore year 
for the first time in  like three years i'm at this school 
for two years in a row 
and so i was like 
no 
i i just finally made friends there's no way in 
um my father and i always 
noise 
whining 
so my father and i 
i'm gonna start getting phone calls here in a little bit i will just postpone 
so 
my father and i always for the third time 
understood each other much better 
then my mother and i did 
we were able to communicate in a very similar fashions 
we didn't always agree in fact i am probably more diametrically opposed to him than anybody else i ever got to play with 
but 
at least he understood what was going on from one moment to the next 
and so it was kind of a no brainer it was like all my friends and somebody who understands 
what i'm saying when i talk to them 
or my mother 
very nice human being 
and a bunch of people i don't know 
mm 
think my mother was okay with it 
uh  all the conversations 
had about 
since then lead me to believe 
yes this didn't traumatize her 
i think it was kind of a no brainer for her as well 
she's like ah yeah all your friends and your dad 
or 
a large new experience that you don't know anything about 
and me 
talking to my mother was always a very arduous affair 
not 
in sort of an evil sense 
necessarily and but just in sort of a a challenging sense consistently 
yes  there was some sort of 
inherent communication breakdown my mother is kind of a flake 
not that i'm not a flake but we're flaky in different ways 
yes 
yes 
no 
rude 
trying come up with 
like  
a narrative that's 
both fun and brief 
okay so 
my friend chris and i are upstairs playing on the computer 
and  
my sister's downstairs watching television 
it's sunday morning 
and um 
i am 
trying to figure out how this game works 
how this game works and then i said  got some information on this game out in the car i'm gonna go get it 
chris you keep playing 
i will be right back 
downstairs out the front door see my sister on 
couch go over to the car 
get the stuff out of the 
and  
look up and there two police 
coming towards me 
like ooh 
police officers 
ooh scary 
okay 
and  
it was funny because 
you see the cops first 
but in reality the cops are behind 
other people i actually know 
but it doesn't matter 
because you always see cops first 
so 
the two other people that i actually know are   
parents 
stepmother and father have been split up for i don't know a month or two now 
they've been married for something like six months now 
and um 
my sister and i both wanted to tell her ahead of time that she's making a horrible mistake but 
she wouldn't have listened to us so we didn't bother telling her 
um 
so 
they're coming up and 
uh there has been like divorce papers and stuff ah 
and i knew that 
police officers are occasionally used to deliver important documents 
i don't personally think that divorce documents are that important 
but 
nothing's beyond the realm of possibility for people take things way out 
way too seriously 
yes 
yes 
but 
there's nobody at home but my sister and i so domestic violence would have been a curious affair so i just figured 
something weird's going on i didn't know what was going on but at the same time 
it was all divorce related 
just 
basically dumb 
because 
the divorce wasn't going to faze me because 
the entire marriage was 
we knew  knew from the beginning it was a dumb idea 
and the divorce thing was kind of inevitable 
so we're just kind of waiting around going oh they're gonna be divorced in a couple months 
and sure enough so anyway 
um 
i 
i look at these people and their names are the  
and so the  are coming forward with two police officers behind them 
and mister  is kind of a large gentleman and he's way too somber 
experience and 
if you have to like be that somber about something as stupid as a divorce i'm going to give you some sort of shit for it 
and 
at the 
um mrs  
used to be a principal of mine elementary school 
uh my stepmother's 
mother 
used to be a principal of mine in elementary school 
so 
uh he's like   think we should talk 
was like 
okay great 
okay so i was like  boy you're way too serious for this particular affair 
okay that's  
we knew ahead of time this also coming to an end don't worry about it 
so i  
at this point in the story i should point out that the paper that i went downstairs for 
i don't know where that is 
i never found it never saw it never it it's 
anyway 
not relevant at all the story but 
it bugs me every time i tell the story because 
doesn't exist 
anyway 
so 
we come back inside and he's like well i've got some bad news and my sister's like 
why 
like all 
okay go ahead 
and he's like 
no i  i think you should sit down i'm like 
all right 
all right 
at at this point   stopped for moment i'm just like 
nobody can think 
their divorce was so important that i need to sit down to deal with it because   obviously 
i  i have the curiosity that something whack is  
is uh 
is afoot 
i 
okay 
i sit down 
say 
your your father killed himself this morning 
and i said 
oh 
and then there's like  sort of a whited out 
period there so 
you don't get like 
decent details on on what occurred i 
think anything exciting occurred 
i think mostly it's me and 
my sister on my lap 
and me smelling my sister's 
wet 
stinky hair 
because it smelled of cigarette smoke for some reason 
so 
wet stinky hair 
wet because i was crying into it 
and then more time passes so some  indeterminate length of time 
later 
um 
i i look over at the police officer who's 
standing on one side and the cops are there basically to make sure i don't freak out 
and that's finally sunk in i was like 
the cops are here so you don't freak 
and like 
oh i'm not really in any danger of freaking out 
am i 
then you're 
and 
was like 
what would freaking out look like 
you would never know 
that's why the cops are here oh 
i was like okay so 
i looked there's a cop i said 
i have a friend 
upstairs and i wasn't able to put on anything more than that 
and it 
come out 
near that well 
but 
managed get that much information out 
so the other cop goes upstairs and 
chris 
chris's interpretation of the story at this point is 
one moment i'm cheerfully playing on the computer and the next moment 
i 
i turn around there's a large police 
of your room 
he said 
hi 
he said i think you should come downstairs 
they don't tell chris anything 
so chris comes downstairs and he 
beside me 
and the cops on 
side of chris 
and 
and now chris is just 
near me trying to be 
near me has no idea what 
the hell is going on 
and 
i this 
this sinks into 
and 
i was like 
you 
don't 
did they tell   any 
you 
he said 
i have no idea what's going on 
oh 
and i couldn't 
anything about 
i couldn't tell him i couldn't communicate i was 
totally 
yeah 
well the 
it was just 
communication wasn't there 
yeah well there wasn't even an opportunity for me to try and think of ways to say it it just 
there was nothing there there was no ability to communicate there was a 
he needs to know this piece of information at the same 
there's no way i could tell it to him so 
yeah 
is like 
so 
so i'm 
yeah you don't know and there's 
nothing else to do about it and continue on merrily and he's i he said eventually he said it was some time later when i actually found out 
going on i said i had some suspicions 
because you can do a quick party count and figure out who's not there and assume something bad has happened but 
um but 
he said 
but it 
was a while before i found out actually 
so 
so we can stop 
we can stop the story here or we can go on because this story 
it 
it's a fun story but 
okay  um 
chris and i 
spent 
the rest of the evening 
calling people 
uh 
i got it in my head that i didn't want anybody to call and to say how's your dad doing 
and so the best way to deal with that situation was to call 
cross the board 
plus it was a fun psychological experiment just 
as 
as they go 
cause 
how often do you get to tell 
your dad just killed himself this 
morning 
so 
how you doing 
no i haven't talked to you in a little while is everything going okay 
actually no my 
my father killed himself this 
morning 
you're kidding 
so 
you you end up 
after a dozen or so people 
narrowing it down 
you've got you're kidding 
you're not serious 
oh my god 
and then you can hash mark them if you want we didn't but you could 
and 
we had two people who who 
um 
said 
you're kidding 
and then said 
never mind i'm sorry pretend i never even said that 
i was like 
wow 
somebody must've done this before 
because everybody is just like 
there's no other response 
but 
so there's there's no faulting i mean these folks but 
still there's nothing else do and there's nothing creative in response to say to this experience so 
you end up with you're kidding again and again and again 
and you had two individuals who said you're kidding and then immediately following it  
never mind pretend i never 
that 
oh yeah 
yeah he was he was giving me phone numbers for 
at least 
two or three hours 
we had 
uh several phone books 
and 
um 
like 
a 
church calling list and some other 
stuff we had just bunches of numbers 
and so he just fed me names and numbers 
and i 
it's not ten after 
okay 
and um 
so let's see at the end of that 
um 
there was a lot of supporting 
uh 
erin 
and then there was some calling of like family people 
younger 
and um 
so there was supporting of erin and then there was calling of girlfriend 
but you can't do the calling of girlfriend until you've arranged for ride because girlfriend lives two and a half hours away 
and so if you call the girlfriend and tell the girlfriend that 
that your father just killed himself 
she freaks out because she 
no way to get there 
so 
you have to arrange for ride first 
ended up having a guy who lives in logan drive up to bowling green 
to get her 
and then drive back down 
uh bring her back 
and he said is there anything i can do i i'm gonna come up there 
i said sure 
drive 
by 
continue on to 
he's like okay 
fine 
no problem 
i said 
then i 
then i could call 
and say 
he will be there  three hours 
be a nice silver r x seven at 
location get in 
and so 
she spent the next 
two and a half hours canceling classes and stuff 
oh 
he 
he's polite i will give him that much 
well 
i defended my stepmother 
uh 
against the rest of my family immediately following my father's death because there was ah some bitterness between the rest of my family and my stepmother 
so my sister and i defended my stepmother against the rest of my family 
stepmother eventually shafted us 
and 
so stepmother is evil 
they're fun 
just saying stepmother makes 
me go 
hope your father doesn't drink 
oh well that's unfortunate 
okay 

my name is  
okay 
what department 
oh just 
was going down like 
oh i tightened this good 
it's like it's falling i oh it there it can go 
cool 
perfect 
okay 
okay 
uh my name is  
am an undergrad double major in german and history currently working on a senior honors thesis 
in history 
i will be graduating next quarter 
after a grand total of six years as an undergrad 
an impressive uh somewhat 
disturbing six years as an undergrad 
ah i live in german village 
uh 
i like it here 
grew up here 
like it here 
uh 
i think of it as a big city 
having been to other big cities it 
feels more like that then small towns which 
i've also 
been to of course but 
my thesis is on the sudeten germans those are the germans who lived in czechoslovakia 
uh 
before the 
second world war 
and uh specifically i'm looking at how they perceived their condition 
switching from being part of the austro hungarian empire 
uh and the germans being sort of the 
uh 
the majority 
uh even though they weren't the majority but sort of the the uh the 
the master nation within the austro hungarian empire to becoming uh 
a minority within czechoslovakia 
ah i've always had an interest in 
german history 
and also in eastern european history 
and 
i mean it seemed to be a natural way that i could tie those two together for a thesis 
german 
yeah 
all right well 
as most people don't like to hear 
uh relatives and stuff i'm taking a year off 
and then ah 
grad school 
uh i 
plan at this point to 
pursue history to the 
p h d level 
ah 
anything of course can happen 
but 
that's my plan 
uh relax 
uh get a a dead end job that doesn't come home with me 
uh 
try and pay off my debt 
and maybe make a little bit 
so 
i i i uh 
grad school yeah 
but 
also enjoy all the things i didn't get to do 
uh 
while 
working on this thesis this is  
project that has been ongoing for about a year 
and i've 
voluntarily given up a lot of things i like to do and i'm looking forward to catching up 
uh 
music 
uh 
painting 
uh 
that sort of thing 
yeah just having fun 
yes i have several times 
um 
well one of the things i'm doing is i'm applying for a number of research grants to go to germany continue my research so hopefully i will get one of those 
um 
i 
think i'm in pretty good 
shape to get one of those so 
uh that's 
that might 
cause me to put off grad school for a year but 
i don't think the grad schools will mind if i 
if they have  someone who gets a grant who's already 
planning to go to their school so 
yeah so 
yeah 
not too much 
uh i was planning on 
i hadn't always planned on taking a year off but getting into the research uh 
like one of the things i sacrificed was looking into grad schools and applying to grad school this past 
year so 
yeah so 
uh 
i mean i i'd like to go here it's one of my  choices cause i like the faculty and i like the program but 
uh uh 
i plan to spend the next couple months well 
the first few months after i graduate looking at other schools 
oh yeah 
yeah 
take care of that soon 
okay 
cool 
ah 
right 
um i would like to teach 
um 
mm the 
the field is 
particularly saturated right now so i'm not 
holding out hopes for a teaching job i mean i'd like to think that i could distinguish myself within the field and get a job but 
i mean right now those jobs simply are not available 
so 
uh i'm 
approaching things like whatever happens happens i'm gonna pursue my interests and then 
go on from there rather than necessarily thinking about 
career plans after i finish my schooling 
oh yeah 
uhhum 
um 
i got into painting somewhat recently 
uh i've always done a lot of art 
uh 
my mom is an elementary school art teacher so i was always exposed to 
art 
as child 
uh did pretty good 
too 
i never got into painting it was mainly drawing that kind of thing 
and just uh 
yeah three or four years ago i thought i'm gonna learn how to paint 
and i learned how to paint 
and 
i like painting 
so 
um 
most of my paintings uh uh  this is gonna sound funny most of my paintings 
are of 
uh 
images from star wars 
now 
this 
most of my paintings were completed 
uh before 
uh like nineteen ninety five nineteen ninety six before 
it came back out it was more of a thing 
like images from my childhood coming back out 
and now it's suddenly 
uh 
you hear about it more often so 
that's why i'm a little funny but 
used to be impressed like i paint star wars 
i paint sesame street or something i don't paint  sesame street just something from childhood 
that i paint and now it's 
somewhat mainstream so it sounds a little funny i also i've 
painted 
a  couple of portraits 
pretty happy with of some friends i 
have done a self portrait 
um 
that kind of thing 
okay 
uhhum 
um 
kind of 
uh i mean it was something i was really into 
uh 
until 
i don't know maybe about fourth or fifth grade at which 
point things sort of switched to 
you know like i don't know like 
killer robots or something like transformers that kind of thing 
uh in high school 
i uh 
i don't know i think i cleaned my room or something or cleaned my closet and found my old toys i'm like star wars is fun i'm gonna watch star wars more often i had them on tape so i 
started watching them and got 
i don't wanna say into it because i know people who are 
really into it 
i'm pretty into it but it's not the same kind of thing i don't think but 
back when i started doing the 
the painting uh 
i i graduated from high school in ninety four just to put things in a little perspective 
uh 
so something like my first couple years of college 
uh from  sort of the second half of 
high school to my first couple years of college i was just sort of 
just 
i don't know i liked the story 
um 

i liked looking at the stories from a 
different perspective as a kid as a kid i was i was always like 
oh boy like 
action 
oh 
fight the bad guys yeah 
and now it's 
uh 
you know like 
looking 
sort of postulating deeper 
meaning 
to 
what the characters have to go through using 
elements of the story as a metaphor 
for 
things in real life 
uh 
and the fact that it was something that did have such an effect on me as a as a child and  our culture i think it's kinda interesting and now that it's coming back 
out 
uh 
i mean i 
look at things from a little different perspective but 
i mean yeah 
of the 
maybe 
i think i've done about ten twelve paintings of which i'm 
like 
consider to be done and 
and like 
uh i'd say 
eight of them 
wars related kinda thing 
so the recent ones have been the 
actually but 
i like star wars 
i didn't like it 
but 
i liked elements of it 
and 
it's 
unlike the the first star wars movie 
this one really is meant to be part of a trilogy 
the first star wars movie when it came out 
i mean it was 
uh uh in  many ways an experiment it was 
part of a of a larger story 
because the larger story was too large to film in one  
one movie 
but 
this one as a as a 
as a part of a whole 
i i'm 
reserving complete judgment until 
until see what else happens i mean from what i know 
this story was kinda happy and 
it was it 
many ways a children's story 
but what has to happen within the larger story between now and 
and 
you know the end of 
episode three 
is 
like 
the republic falls 
and the empire takes over and all the jedi are killed by this cute little eight year old kid 
yeah 
right 
uhhum 
yeah 
i'd always maintained that uh 
back in the day uh 
the darth vader was the tragic hero of the star wars thing it wasn't 
you know about 
like 
the innocence of luke skywalker 
and 
rebellion and 
casting off authority and that kind of stuff it was about someone making a bad choice 
uh 
you know gaining power because of it 
and then ultimately seeing the the folly of the ways and dying 
in the classic 
um 
tragic hero sort of 
way 
um 
and so i'm looking forward to how they build up to that point 
um lot of people when i was in high school they're what the hell are you talking about bo 
but uh 
um 
yeah i'm looking forward to seeing how things 
come about 
ah i like star trek 
um 
not so much old star trek 
uh i like deep space nine of the new ones 
um 
i mean 
back when it was new i liked the next generation but 
once deep space nine came out and it had a grittier 
darker story that 
wasn't so 
cookie cutter in fashion there was  uh 
a greater degree of continuity from episode to episode 
and 
more character development 
it wasn't like these perfect 
people on this ship going and facing bad  the the characters themselves had flaws 
and that caused for better drama so i like that don't like 
voyager so much i 
i see that it 
when it first came out i had high hopes because i saw it 
as something that would be even grittier 
they had the the potential for for 
excellent 
intercharacter conflict 
but they glossed over all those immediately 
within the first season 
um 
and 
that 
really bothered me and then 
it 
ultimately the story's like 
they're trapped 
but they don't 
really pursue like the 
issues of being separated from home in 
two factions that had 
very big differences 
stuck together on a small ship 
they just 
glossed over those and it became just like the next generation except for they didn't 
talk to the federation as much anymore so i didn't like that one so much but 
yeah 
yeah 
her her little boyfriend who was the 
the captain kirk 
commander riker  like 
stud persona 
i see in many ways 
i 
i mean i agree in deep space ah um 
big deep space nine fan it's like i don't dislike voyager i just don't like it to the same degree 
um 
in deep space nine they had major kira who was a soldier 
and a revolutionary 
and 
i thought in many ways she 
like 
completely broke out of traditional gender roles i 
also like deep space nine in that 
uh 
they address the issue of different people living and working  different people of different 
i mean these were 
aliens rather than different  
ethnic denominations of humans but it it 
approached that from a less 
um 
from uh a more realistic standpoint in instead of having it you know like an old star trek you know everyone gets along then we 
come to people who don't get along and we look at the problems 
it was 
centered on that 
uh 
i i'm getting off topic i wanted to go back to to 
Voyager what you were saying about the 
the 
the uh 
generals i 
i liked  
at first having 
uh 
captain janeway being a female in the leadership standpoint but i  
i still think that 
uh 
the  
the women on the show particularly 
seven of nine 
um 
there are used as sex objects 
uh for the for the viewers 
you know she doesn't have to be wearing that tight outfit i think that's for ratings 
i really do think it's for ratings 
um 
she wears high heels why would she wear high 
it's 
story elements 
her forceful personality too 
is 
yeah i mean i don't see any particular reason for her to wear the spandex 
except for to appeal to a 
uh eighteen through twenty five male audience which 
i think it does 
let's watch seven of nine 
with the the children yeah 
yeah 
my favorite character 
on that show 
had always been 
chacote 
and i don't like how 
i don't like how his character has been portrayed in  
in the  couple of seasons 
um 
i liked the fact that he was someone who had been a star fleet officer 
but 
because of a matter of principle 
uh left star fleet joined the makee but was still 
uh fundamentally an honorable person 
um 
and 
had to deal with being welcomed back into the fold of star fleet 
by being 
uh first officer on the ship but still had to balance 
his his new life 
uh i saw so much 
potential for 
uh 
interesting stuff with that 
but i feel that 
he's 
become just the 
just another character to 
deliver lines for most of the episodes that i've seen from the 
this 
this past season i stopped 
watching it for a while 
period and then since 
deep space nine left i needed a little star trek fix every once and a while 
so i started watching it i also don't have cable so ah it's on 
u p n and fifty three doesn't come in terribly well so 
um i mean sometimes it's like i don't want 
kind of see what's going on but 
um i liked it there's an episode i think it was in the third season where they were stuck on an island 
or 
island 
it's an island but a planet together i liked it 
there i kinda like and i figure 
they will probably hook up but 
i don't like how the show 
this show and this happened with deep space nine two and 
even with 
next generation for a little bit 
how the show's become 
soap opera like 
um i mean the romantic aspects of the stories don't  appeal to me very much 
um i'm more interested in the social things and you know good old special effects 
um 
but 
i i think i like 
that how it's kept with a sort of 
i 
tension and it's not 
like 
they're not 
completely thrown together like 
uh 
b'elanna and tom 
which 
i don't like that at all 
and it's just sort of like uh whenever it comes on i roll my eyes 
that episode where they were stuck out in space and 
just 
if the tape can catch me rolling my eyes it's oh 
every week 
i record them 
i 
yeah 
like x files 
i love that 
no i don't want them to get together i love the tension if they get together it's dead 
whenever they get 
uh 
any of there are like five or six examples where it looks like there gonna hook up i mean that one where there's like a 
a  
a the duplicate mulder 
well that guy who can change form 
that 
in the movie they're about to kiss and  i don't like it when they get that close 
i 
i like the 
how their  their relationship is still professional 
and they interact with each other on that level first and they're very good friends 
and they have that tension but they don't 
succumb to it and 
i really like it i just dislike it a little less 
or  um 
like it a little less or dislike it a little more when 
when it 
it looks like it's gonna come to  it looks like they're 
it feels like they're trying to tease me 
as an audience and uh uh i 
that's not something i feel peased by 
particularly 
uh 
which one are you  
yeah 
it felt innocent to me 
and i liked that 
um because all the other times where they started to kiss 
it's always been like 
stereotypical romantic da da da da da 
and that's like 
wow two friends alone 
it's new years 
perfect 
you know it wasn't it wasn't like they were gonna jump in the sack or anything like that 
it was just 
so i didn't object to that one at all 
uhhum 
um 
i feel that the past season 
the past two seasons really haven't been as strong as the earlier seasons 
and so 
in some ways i'm 
you know  i 
i'm not as upset about 
the x files 
completing it's run as i have been about other shows i mean it's also the simpsons 
final season i've heard 
ah 
i've heard it it hasn't been as 
I've heard it from 
less reputable sources 
so 
yeah 
yeah  
i love that show i've nearly every episode on tape but this past 
this past season i've 
i've been really disappointed 
with the simpsons 
yeah 
yeah 
been highly 
critical of of organized religion 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
i mean i i think that the stories haven't been 
ah i i mean i'm 
some of my favorite 
like lines from the simpsons is where there highly critical 
one of my favorites is uh when bart 
the one with where 
bart thinks he loses his soul 
which in some ways is kinda preachy 
um 
cause i mean 
like 
lisa takes 
other positions like ya whether the soul is is real it doesn't matter da da da da da 
but i love it one scene while they're 
cleaning out the 
uh 
well 
bart and  are being punished they're cleaning out the pipes 
of the organs 
and 
the the pipes of the organ and uh 
like 
bart's like there's no such thing as a soul milhouse is like why would they lie to us what would they have to gain and then they 
it cuts to uh 
reverend lovejoy 
emptying 
the uh 
uh 
uh what are they uh the 
the 
tip jars the 
the donation thing into a little change counting machine 
like 
i don't hear cleaning 
what would they have to gain 
um 
oh yeah 
yeah it's like what religion are you 
oh that one it has all those 
those great rules 
work out in real life 
christianity 
yeah 
you're happy and you know it clap your hands 
yeah i 
i like that aspect i mean i don't know i don't pay attention to who the writers are 
um so maybe the writing 
has changed 
south pacific yeah 
yeah 
gambling 
yeah i mean 
i want to see how the season ends out it's just 
a lot of the one's this season to me have just been disappointing the 
i mean i think every show sort of has a peak some shows 
peak towards the end some at the beginning and sort of 
level off i mean the the simpsons had a stretch 
from like their third year 
through like their seventh where things were just 
like 
unbelievably funny and 
then they had some writing changes i think and this 
this season is just 
it's 
been 
completely outrageous story lines 
and 
like 
the jokes aren't as integrated into the story 
i mean there will be 
there seems to me there more one liners 
so i'm a little disappointed i'm sad that the show's going off 
the  the show's gonna stop but i'm not as 
sad because the product i'm getting now it 
with the simpsons 
having it being replaced by futurama which 
ah i find to be 
absolute genius 
so it's not so bad it 
x files 
i'm sad but not as sad based on the past couple seasons when deep space nine went off the 
the air that one really bothered me 
and 
they even had a star trek replacement 
still on but uh 
i don't know 
um 
kinda you know we know but it's 
what i've 
liked so much about it is they tell you everything and then 
you find out that it's not right 
and that it's wrong i mean 
there was the episode 

uh the two parter 
uh last season where it was 
the advertises full disclosure 
and 
what 
and the first episode the first half was 
excellent had the cigarette smoking man just 
it was from his perspective 
he was talking that then the second half got like 
oh no 
and it turns out it was the 
the uh the faceless aliens set a trap for the 
for the guys and 
i didn't like the way it was resolved but i like the fact that it wasn't 
resolved the way that they set it up 
so i think that 
i mean  
we supposedly know about samantha 
but 
she's out there somewhere 
you know we don't 
have 
again we don't have clear evidence 
where she is and there were couple times where they 
where we thought we knew where samantha was 
uh 
and when there were all those clones of her 
uh i think that was in the second season or so 
um 
i think if  
if they were gonna end it they were gonna have to have like three episodes in a row that just were tieing up all these loose ends that they keep having 
i suspect they probably won't do that 
they will 
um 
leave things open ended for 
future tv movies or maybe another 
uh 
feature length movie 
uh 
yeah 
and they're also talking about 
cause 
uh 
uh 
the actors 
the the reason they're 
ending it 
is because the actors don't wanna do it there was talk i don't know if there still pursuing this 
that 
they'd have new 
characters 
take over the roles and 
i mean 
the character development is the most important part i think 
um 
so i think that will be a failure but that also 
sort of 
tells me that they're gonna leave things kinda open 
right 
they they could have taken 
i mean well they killed all these people off but  they 
could have 
you will put them into the background 
you have them do a couple of shows a season 
and then had 
you know i don't know the adventures of 
uh 
oh  
agent spender and  
the hell what's 
what's her name 
but then they they killed off 
all those like 
supporting 
former x files associated people 
so they they couldn't go in that direction they'd have to just bring in new people which uh 
i think it 
probably wouldn't be a good idea 
yeah 
and 
i 
i used to kinda worry about the effect that tv had on me 
um 
i when i was little i used to watch a lot of tv 
i'd come home from school and plop myself in front of the tv 
and watch 
i like you know four cartoons back to back or so everyday after school or i 
that kind of thing and then saturday mornings it would be uh a block of 
you know from six in the morning until afternoon 
or something these days i don't watch 
nearly that much tv 
um 
i don't buy these 
arguments that people make that say that 
like 
children 
are 
like 
like violence in tv is affecting children i mean 
i i've seen some  evidence of 
of 
exercises where in schools the 
kids will watch uh 
like a a violent cartoon like 
i don't know like 
roadrunner or something 
and then 
be a little 
rougher 
but i  
i don't  
that it 
it goes into like values i don't associate like 
rising crime 
or something with 
uh 
like crime on tv or something i 
i mean it 
if there is a correlation 
i mean i 
i'm more of the 
you know like 
parents have a greater influence on the 
children then tv ever could 
i mean i  watched a lot tv but 
i feel that my parents taught me was right and wrong and 
i watched a lot of 
rather violent tv violent movies all that kinda thing and uh 
um 
i have become visually desensitized to 
like 
the violence that i see in movies and on tv 
but 
i still see a distinct difference between that 
and 
real violence 
um 
i mean 
in studying history i'm exposed to a number of 
like 
rather 
gruesome events in history 
that still  
i still find disturbing 
um 
also 
hang out in low life bars and every once in a while there will be a fight and it it still it 
i mean it 
it still is 
disturbing to me i i'm 
i have a distinct difference in my head between 
reality and fiction 
and 
maybe kids 
like aren't making that distinction but  
i don't think so and i think if if 
someone isn't making that distinction 
it's 
i don't know that 
that they're not  
well 
i  i don't know i don't have any evidence to uh to support it i just know that i have it 
i feel that i have a distinct 
uh  uh uh very clear distinction between what is 
uh 
fact and what is fiction what is 
true and what is imaginary 
and uh 
so 
for me i don't think that television has affected me 
in that way 
um 
i mean one way that  
television has affected me 
is 
i am full of media references when i speak you know when i'm hanging out with friends someone 
mentions a 
a subject i'm like hey 
simpsons made fun of that 
you know at some point 
ah 
uh 
that's the effect that it sees on me i don't think that's too big an effect people always used to 
you know like 
quote 
shakespeare or something i guess that's 
ten times more 
elevated so like oh 
references that shakespeare line or something but 
i mean it 
it's a part of our culture and i'm a part of 
it 
but 
i don't see it as negatively effecting me i still get all the stuff done i need to get done 
um 
well i found that 
that 
i mean  everyone 
has 
people from outside the united states have stereotypes about the united states and when they actually get to know someone 
those stereotypes dissipate 
um 
i mean 
i actually had a conversation very similar to 
this 
the other night 
with a  
couple of germans that i met 
at a coffee house 
um 
i mean the 
the stereotype that most 
americans have of germans are those of bavarians 
uh and not real bavarians but stereotypical bavarians uh 
beer drinking bratwurst eating 
sauerkraut eating 
lederhosen wearing 
uh 
you know 
blond haired blue eyed 
overweight people 
yeah 
yeah well  
i asked these germans what the  what stereotypes they 
like are 
prevalent in germany 
uh of americans and they said 
you know americans are cowboys 
and eat at mcdonald's 
three meals a day 

and 
now it's our turn to deal with the issues 
we see our parents we see this generation that all these things that are still popular it's that we don't look down on the sixties i mean i 
think the sixties sounded like a pretty fun time to live 
i would get into politics in a second 
um 
but 
those things are popularized but no we can't do it anymore because we got all these problems 
um 
aids being one of them 
um 
uh 
politics 
i mean 
we 
we grew up 
or came of age 
after the cold war was over 
um 
i'm 
very cynical about this i have a 
fairly leftist 
uh political  
uh 
uh stance 
which i feel 
has been 
completely devoiced in america because of the effects of the cold war 
uh 
i've inherited this world where there was 
of uh 
uh where am i going with this 
um 
i mean the generation before us had 
like vietnam 
and protested against it 
i mean they were in many ways protesting against the generation before 
but 
and when it came down to it 
i mean the 
what was the protest really about 
you know and 
i'm not being clear so i'm not exactly sure where i'm going with this i very cynical of 
uh about 
about the world i've inherited 
uh cause i see a world in which 
my political views 
have been silenced by 
fifty years of 
of 
you know like international politics 
sort of like 
propaganda 
um 
that says you know like 
to be left of a certain point is bad 
like among conservative circles the word liberal is is like 
almost like calling someone a communist in 
in the forties 
um 
where as 
i'm very cynical about that cause it 
they feel that 
it it wasn't 
it it it's been a cultural process that has been developed 
and now i'm being handed 
this current situation which i 
see is completely unfair 
i mean i think the reason 
that our generation is   cynical and the reason i'm cynical 
is 
because 
we're handed a world 
in which 
we see 
the injustices of the past or 
not the  the the hypocrisy 
i mean i guess injustice 
also applies in 
terms of things like 
the cold war and stuff but 
that's why i'm cynical 
i hope that answers your question at least a little bit 
i don't know 
i feel kinda preachy 
like this is my position 
uh 
the technology 
um 
i mean 
like 
i 
like living  
in a world where technology puts everything i need at my fingertips 
um 
i mean 
uh 
i think that something that would not have happened had there not been 
a uh 
uh 
a highly 
a 
highly populous generation suddenly that 
was competing and 
within itself 
mean i 
some ways i think 
competition is a bad thing because in our society it's usually not fair 
someone always starts out ahead and is able to get ahead further but 
i mean 
i like the fact that we've got this super high tech tape recorder not a big reel to reel thing i like the fact that i could do a lot of my research for my thesis on a 
a computer internet 
rather than 
like 
going to the card catalog finding out that there are books that are  
that are not in our library and then 
where do i go from there 
um 
i like being able to look oh 
library of congress has it 
i will just drive out to washington 
or have them send it here 
you know 
um 
that i think is a major contribution of the past generation 
uh 
civil rights 
um 
well i i take the 
extreme position 
that civil rights 
are an illusion 
um 
yeah they're on paper 
which is a good thing because it was a terrible thing 
when 
uh there were laws that 
restricted someone because of their ethnic background or because of their gender 
but i think in many ways 
it has had 
little  
on creating an equal and fair society 
um 
some my leftist positions will come out right now 
um 
people have the freedom 
but 
i believe that based upon where 
where in the social stratum where you were born 
in the united states 
uh you have a 
a limited ability to move 
upward 
and that the these 
i mean i 
i don't want to say class lines because that has so many 
like 
historical connotations cause it's 
not the 
exact same as say class was in the marx's sense 
but 
class lines still today very much 
um 
follow race lines 
and 
what good is 
like 
knowing that you have the freedom to vote 
when you know painfully well 
that 
you are not going to be able to get a job that's gonna 
buy a house 
for your family and let them live in a relative comfort 
i mean 
in real terms in things i think are 
valuable to the individual 
uh civil rights 
only went so far 
they haven't 
corrected the wrongs of the past they haven't 
uh created uh a a 
a sense in our 
society that anyone can achieve like the american dream in in my opinion is an absolute lie 
and that the 
the 
the people who 
whom most face that lie 
are 
the supposed beneficiaries of civil rights legislation 
um 
so what 
i mean civil rights was an 
an important step but once that step was made it was stopped 
and now i believe today there are 
uh 
i mean it 
i 
see a a growing movement of people who want to 
who 
curtail the advances that were made 
in the sixties 
and it's not our generation who's curtailing it it's still 
the uh 
like 
our 
parents' generation 
um 
right 
right 
yeah 
mm 
ah 
it 
yeah 
we have definitely made some progress in that direction 
i still think that there is considerable  
progression that needs to be made 
um 
i was just talking to someone a couple of weeks ago who's a fellow history major 
her 
and actually her brother's a  
fellow history major too and a friend of mine i don't know him all that well which 
her family 
i mean she's 
she's double major in history and chemistry 
she plans to go to med school 
her parents 
her family supports her in this but they've made it painfully clear 
that 
when 
it 
she shouldn't plan on having a career because  she's gonna hafta raise children at some point which is 
uh 
that's not the way things should work in my 
belief uh and and 
the fact that it's like the males telling the daughter 
like 
this is 
how things need to be i think 
i mean 
you know i think an  
individual should have the choice 
but i feel i mean  i'm concerned about a 
a uh 
like this push to the right 
that's sort of going on hoping it's sort of dieing out 
but i mean it seemed a little scarier back in like ninety four ninety five but uh 
i think uh uh 
we've reached a point 
where 
because not all of the 
advances 
have 
been one hundred percent successful 
the the opposition is 
criticizing the advance 
um 
and 
and trying to stop it 
um 
uh i'm trying to think of some 
good examples 
i mean 
when politicians start talking about like biological functions 

well i live on the south west side and work in dublin 
i don't get to campus very much 
i get to campus but it's usually up to the o s u stadium of the o s u stadium 
uh studios 
yeah i work on the auction 
up there 
so i sort of avoid the  
main campus 
it's been a long time since i been around here 
uh fawcett center so it's 
it's not even really on campus 
yeah 
uh 
uh okay wait you know where the schott 
is 
yeah it's over 
it's on olentangy down there 
north of there 
okay 
yeah they did it is warm in here 
and now 
now it's 
now you 
uh huh 
that's fine 
well my title's senior consulting data base specialist 
work for company called  
it's in dublin 
um 
i work in 
it's hard to say what i do i consult on a lot of projects 
we do  we develop a lot of software and 
projects and 
i consult on the data base side 
no we run an online system where people 
connect to our system and build a data bases 
or or access the data bases 
it's  
uh 
everything o s u has 
in their library collection 
is in our system 
their records came from us 
uhhuh 
yeah  well they yeah 
and we do that for  
tens of thousands of libraries 
yeah 
uh essentially all the big academics most the  
uh  it's actually 
all over the world it's international 
the  
yeah probably cause we have some public systems 
most of them are for the librarians but there's some for public too 
yeah 
right 
yeah we don't have a web browser version that's what we're working on now that's what i've been working on 
yeah 
well 
there is a web access to some of our systems when that's all  we're  putting a more uniform one up for everything 
and i don't it may be 
they 
o s u has some system but they can also connect to our system 
for things they don't have in their system and it's 
so i'm not sure what 
system you're talking 
yeah and 
i don't know what o s u's is set up like 
yeah 
they might connect to us they might not 
it's a lot of the it's looks a  and feel is a lot a lot the same 
yeah 
yes 
and your display might be different but it's it's basic information and i and 
we developed the system that people started doing that on is sharing the data 
um 
actually it started here on o s u campus and now we're independent 
yeah 
no i worked at the library when i was a student 
actually i 
that's what got me interested and so i went to library school and 
yeah 
uh case western 
cleveland 
you're not from around here are you 
well 
oh okay 
a lot of exciting stuff going on now at the libraries it's not 
not the old  
old lady in the bun 
yeah 
yeah 
and the web has really changed that 
no i work for the company but i consult on a lot of projects 
within the company 
um 
yeah we're doing pretty well it's about a hundred fifty million dollar business 
oh thirty 
forty thousand it's international 
yeah 
yeah i don't 
well we just sort of started making a big splash in 
australia in about the last three years 
so uh they they may now they may have 
yeah 
yeah they they  all of them there's 
actually other systems too and they all have pretty much the same look 
but as you said there's little details that are different and 
oh yeah 
i've been doing it i've been there twenty over twenty years so 
yeah i'm enjoying it 
it's always changing 
oh 
the technology is changing i mean the web is really revolutionized what we're doing 
uh 
well it's 
anybody can connect to the web 
uh before we used to have a 
that only people in the back 
room of the libraries connected  and it was 
all mainframe and then people got p c's 
on their desk and suddenly the whole world of 
who could access 
any system and what they could do on their desk 
changed 
uh and now we've gone more out in the public work in the public scene do it's not just for the people in the back room 
uh 
and then the web 
you know people anybody anywhere can connect we only worked with libraries before now we're trying to figure out 
how do we deal with anybody who just can wants to connect to us 
most of them that are our site now we have more of a distributed system where we can actually go out and connect to others 
people 
connect to us and then go out as a gateway to other places 
yeah 
we're 
getting more into that now 
but that wasn't easy 
so easy before either the 
you know the web again 
then that has changed it 
no we 
we haven't 
uh 
you know there's always that 
uh but we haven't 
yeah it can be a problem uh if you get hit 
know like if our system would shut down it would cost us 
i don't remember what it is you know tens of thousands of dollars for every hour 
that we're down 
if our data base would be trashed 
our main 
base would be trashed we'd have real serious problems and it could take weeks 
or 
months to rebuild it 
uh yeah so it could be a problem 
uh we've got people working in that area 
wait a minute i don't know what you mean 
oh 
uh 
well 
yeah well librarians traditionally have problems with 
and it's like a form of censorship 
you know big brother things 
have 
always had problems with that 
uh 
i 
i don't know it's 
it's hard to balance it 
if somebody's out there actually doing criminal work 
criminal activity 
and causing damage you want to know about it but how do you 
do that and still protect the rights of everybody else it's 
i don't know how to balance it 
what do you mean 
right right and that 
yeah 
and again if it's criminal activity 
you want  you want somebody to stop it and know about it but if it's 
i'm not doing anything i want anybody to know about 
yeah and then what's to prevent them from going and finding out what some companies doing what research is 
and that's the part that's a threat on the web too is that 
you can connect in somebody's system and they don't know that you're there and you can see what they're doing if 
doing research 
uh you know developing a new product or something you can 
yeah 
it's 
corporate espionage 
and i'm sure that's going on and i've heard cases of it 
yeah 
well 
and the thing is people are real sharp and no matter what you do they will find a way  
you know 
it's 
nobody's found a way to prevent people from 
in 
and people are real good about finding new ways to do it 

ah yeah 
yeah  yeah i guess so there i mean there people who spend seem to  hours doing computers doing this type of thing 
just going out there and seeing what they can find 
i know i  i do not want to go i don't want to touch a computer when i go home 
uh no that's okay  ya know don't 
i just don't want to touch it i just 
i'd do anything but touch the computer and sometimes it's like six and seven hours a day at the computer and 
i just don't wanna do it 
yeah 
no no and 
too many wires here got it 
uh no it's a it's a 
it's 
basically eight five 
yeah monday through friday 
uh just 
i i traveled some and so i had to travel on a weekend so i got to 
ya know comp time 
so i gave myself a long weekend 
yeah it is i wish i'd wish i'd been last weekend it was real nice last weekend 
so i gave gave myself a long weekend and just 
catch up 
just sleep a little bit run around 
my daughter's getting ready to go to italy so that's 
yeah 
so that's 
taking some running around 
uh it's a high school  
trip 
uh she's in eleventh grade 
yeah they're going it's spring break 
couple of teachers are taking a bunch of kids 
no 
teachers couple teachers  take a bunch a kid 
every couple years they go to a different country 
uh it's bishop  
it's a now you're you're not from around here so 
it's like it's a catholic school over on the west side 
we had to pay for the yeah oh yeah we oh yeah 
yeah we're 
for it 
yeah it's a tour it's a package tour 
ah ya know rome florence 
venice pisa 
doesn't interest me 
yeah 
yeah they only have like couple days in each city 
that's 
that's not much 
i like going some place and spending a week and just 
exploring 
yeah my wife and i like to do that 
yeah the 
relaxants yeah 
yeah we did that my wife and i been to san francisco couple times first time was did all the tourist things 
and the next time i said well let's just go 
let's just go and 
wander round and see and we spent more time in 
both of m  both of them are good for different ya know 
yeah i got a son he's a senior at otterbein 
yeah 
about four five years 
it's not that bad 
how old 
oh that is very young yeah 
you don't want another one 
and ya know diapers 
out of the way before you go to the next one 
yeah 
it worked out fine for us 
no 
uh was just the usual thing since she touched my things 
ya know because they were far apart enough they had their own social groups 
they had their own friends and so 
ya know so that 
and interests so it 
there wasn't much of that but there was the usual ya know 
she's breathing on me in the car he's humming too loud 
i don't know if you've got brothers and sisters but yeah 
you've probably been you've went through it all yeah 
well there were five of us and 
a lot of that 
no no i think with five of m it's just it's more 
more constant 
well no well 
kids went 
catholic schools up through eighth grade then he wanted to switch to public school 
it was columbus 
he went to uh fort hayes 
um 
pretty good he liked it a lot but it was a big change from the catholic school 
big change 
uh 
he liked it a lot but i don't know if you're familiar with fort hayes it's a um it's um 
college prep 
um 
they call it alternative school it's called magnet school in most places 
um  it's college prep 
with an emphasis on the arts and there's some career programs there 
so it was a good good for him 
yeah and 
uh and a lot of performing arts you were expected to take something in performing and visual arts every year 
uh 
which is good for him 
the catholic school he was going to go to was big on sports and my son's 
athletic 
and so this was 
that's why he 
wanna go so this 
this was a good choice for him 
or that 
yeah 
uh i don't know 
um 
yeah well 
um 
i think the teachers are every bit as good as dedicated but i think there seems to be 
uh 
the whole administration up through the board and 
just 
it's not as focused 
ya know i don't know how to describe it's like 
the teachers are  sort of  it seemed like they almost had the feeling they're on their own 
where it's more cohesive within the catholic schools like that 
seems to be very clear they're all going in the same direction and working as a team 
i don't know if you ever listened to any of the uh 
columbus board of education meetings are on the radio 
uh pretty interesting 
everybody talks and frequently nobody's listening 
it's 
yeah it's it's pretty interesting um 
talking about how they don't have the money for this and they don't have the money for that and then somebody comes up with 
well let's spend the money over on something else and nobody acts on it then they go on to something else 
oh yeah 
well uh it's like the 
well you  how long have you been here 
uh okay 
well there 
few years ago there was this big fuss so ya know 
got to close some schools 
ya know 
dropping it's 
ya know 
it's the way 
population goes 
enrollment's dropping we can't afford to keep them all going so let's close and they did this big study and they 
targeted some to close 
well there was a big uproar from the people 
who's kids went to that school 
like there will be whenever you close a school so the board backed down and changed it's mind 
the next year they came out with a study saying they need more schools 
but there wasn't the money for it so there was a big fuss about that then 
two years later they came out with another study 
it says well they need to refurbish or not 
some schools close a couple then knock some down and rebuild m 
and it's like every two years it's a different direction and it's like they're almost afraid to take a stand that somebody's not gonna like 
well if you're gonna shut a school down somebody's gonna be really ticked off 
right 
i my  my kids went to a school that 
well my son had already left it but in 
the fourth grade they announced 
took all the kids in the auditorium and said 
we're closing next year 
and it was hard but 
yeah once it's reached the point that's decision is made and announced and 
i mean there 
good reasons for it 
um 
and they explained the reasons and 
ya know 
at some point 
you have to figure out how much do you wanna fight something 
when it's inevitable 
well that's the problem i think we 

school board they're always stopping something and they don't seem to move forward very well 
i don't 
i don't know if that's what percolates it 
it's very different in the public schools the catholic school the public school 
you have all the problems of society school you have the drugs you have the absentee  you have the delinquency 
in the catholic school they just 
you don't have that for one thing 
uh ya know it's oriented around the church even though we're not catholic 
it's still oriented as so there's lot of values 
that permeates everything well they don't do that in the public school because if you do that somebody's gonna get ticked off it's the wrong value and 
why are you doing this to my kid 
um 
so i think that's missing 
that's a problem within the school 
the public schools 
uh 
so just seems to be more distraction from the educational process know mean when you're in the catholic school and you're in classroom 
they deal with the discipline 
if they need to 
course part the  way they deal with it is they take the real problems and send them  back to the 
uh but in the public schools you just have to deal with this all the time and i think  
it's harder for the teachers to teach 
cause there's too much stuff in the way of 
they  
really they're there to do 
i don't know i hadn't thought about that 
uh 
i don't 
no i don't 
i don't get the impression the values as anything 
to do with what they're doing in the school 
well i get the sense that if there are discipline problems it's so hard to get anything done 
solve them unless you unless somebody brings a gun and waves it around the school ya know that's 
the big thing now but just that ya know 
it's just so hard to get anything  
um 
and i think at that point the teachers get frustrated because they don't see the support 
throughout through the administration and if they do have 
they have to wait til something's pretty 
pretty egregious before they 
before it's dealt with 
yeah 
they're   from doing much 
yeah 
yeah i yeah i just don't think that they 
can do much 
and i 
i'm sure it's very frustrating for them 
well and i know it is 
we got friend who's 
was a teacher she just retired a couple years ago she's about our age 
and uh 
it's it's very different now 
uh 
you know it's she said it's scary going into the classroom sometimes 
uh and before it wasn't that you knew that if you had a problem you could make a  
know go and get something dealt with it 
now you can't get backing on it 
no 
and she said ya know and 
and the  the last three or four years she just rode it out so she could retire 
and she used be very dedicated 
uh very dedicated teacher she just 
it was a job then 
and  i hate see that happen to good teachers 
right 
right when it's just frustration after frustration 
yeah that 
yeah 
but i don't see that in the catholic school now in the catholic school they're not even paid as well as the public schools 
but the environment is 
better for education 
no 
well my son  
yeah i son started 
public school for kindergarten 
and he just 
my son is 
my son is a very social 
child we will say  
he's the one that talks too much 
as the teachers say he's the social 
child 
he talks too much he likes to get up and run around and he needs something very structured 
i mean he needs time to run around but he needs something very structured you get him 
near a bunch of  other kids when he was little and it was like he would just run and scream at them cause he was ready to play 
well 
yeah and 
yeah my and my  my daughter's the opposite that 
uh 
but he would do that 
and 
so he wasn't 
he was very  he wasn't 
learning things 
and he was constantly getting in trouble 
it was like 
i 
i don't know 
we would be told he was a 
problem but he didn't understand what was going on and it  there wasn't structure he would go to school everyday and not know what to expect 
because there wasn't like 
this 
we will do this and then we will do this and we will do this 
so we checked out the catholic school and they were organized that way 
and it just was a better  better match for him 
and then 
my daughter 
went to school was just easier to take them to the same school 
and that goes back 
reminded me of another thing i wanted to say about why the 
discipline and 
and behavior may be different in the catholic school is 
you're paying big 
you're paying bucks 
you know it's four  
forty five hundred dollars a year for 
us 
to send her to school 
uh 
and if we find out she's not doing her 
work 
it's 
very different 
uh 
yeah 
so i think she's getting a better education than he did but 
it's because she's doing the work and and she knows she's expected to has to and 
he 
my son's the kind he'd rather play than work and so he 
he rode a lot and 
and he and he paid for it when he got to college it was rough  for him to start out because he was behind then 
no 
mean 
oh they have religion they have a religion class they have religion everyday but some of it is just starting with prayer and bible stories and some it's more the values 
uh lot those teachers aren't catholic 
which  i was surprised to hear that 
uh in fact the religion teacher that my daughter had in ninth grade she had religion class everyday wasn't catholic 
yeah i thought that was interesting 
uh so  it is a values 
you know 
the the 
christian 
values thing 
uh 
i don't have problem with we had little problems like my son had to learn the hail mary 
and we had to find somebody to teach it to us 
write it down for us because we didn't know and 
they wrote it down wrong so he learned it wrong and he got marks off 
and we and we didn't 
yeah little things like that 
but it wasn't a problem 
uh 
there was a problem 
with my son for a while because the priest they had there wouldn't let him take communion and all the other kids were taking communion 
and that's pretty much the priest decides that 
and he 
and he felt 
singled out 
and he was i mean he was the only one 
and he was uncomfortable with that 
uh 
but it hasn't been a problem 
uh 
i'm 
not a religious person myself 
but i'm not against it 
and if i  
maybe i've justified it to myself by saying well they're teaching values 
no well he right now he's really interested in eastern religions i'm not sure where that came from 
you know when they go to college and they're gone and you don't see them much 
uh 
that's what he's interested in right now 
so i don't think it it it it really took 
right 
and 
if my daughter doesn't seem ah 
yeah 
yeah 
we have talked about some things that are 
you know the pope says this is 
what is and 
knowing full well that this is not what we think at home 
we 
abortion and homosexuals and 
we're  much more liberal than that and 
yeah 
that's where there's been a problem but we're very open about that at home  
with 
my daughter is strong willed 
well no she sort of knows this is what she  has to say at school 
if she's asked on a test because she needs the points for a grade 
but she doesn't believe it 
yeah yeah she's very pragmatic 
she could probably 
well she's she's interested in physical therapy 
is that what your wife is 
oh 
and so you had 
physical therapist did it yeah 
but it fixed it 
yeah 
drugs 
right 
yeah so that's what she's interested in right now she's looking to see if she can find someplace to 
work this summer 
even if it's just a day a week 
some clinic or something just to 
to see whats goes on day to day 
why's that 
really 
you mean instead of a doctor 

huh 
i wonder if that's also socialized medicine there 
it is socialized isn't it 
yeah 
yeah my best friend lives in 
on 
outside canberra 
and she has a lot of medical problems but 
huh 
they're covered but it was real tricky because she sort of had some of she was a u s citizen 
she fell in love through email over the internet 
back in the early 
like nineteen ninety it was real early 
and went over there and married the guy 
and so she had some of the medical problems when she emigrated and 
uh it was just 
it took years to get that straightened out 
but she's covered now 
hm 
it's medicare type thing 
yeah 
and as 
more and more people are getting older and older there be more 
need for it 
it be a lot of things there's gonna be more need for as people get older 
tests 
uh yeah 
yeah 
well and i think chiropractors will be 
more popular for the same type of reason 
yeah 
huh 
i uh i've gone to one but i had a back problem that's how 
dealt with it 
and it worked 
the same thing you know i think they're terrific 
for the right things 
yeah 
oh okay 
oh you don't ask an easy one do you 
that's a that's really 
yeah that's i mean that's really a tough one 
uh because it's 
i think people are looking for easy answers and there is no easy answer 
um 
and you know i don't think it's violence on tv 
i don't think it's working parents i think  
and i don't know what it is 
it seems to be something more pervasive than 
could be solved easily 
um 
i don't know it's a tough one and 
i mean your daughter 
uh you said 
daughter's yeah 
is still young so you have to deal with but is scary 
you send your kid to school and you hear these things and it's just 
no matter where it is in the country or the world 
you hear of it you know 
really worries you 
i'm very 
much in favor of gun 
control very strong gun control 
um 
i it they just seem to be too available 
but then some of the things that the schools are doing about it 
know the kid who comes to school with a paper gun gets 
suspended that's 
a little much but 
i don't know i saw in the paper some kid was suspended because he had a paper 
he drew a picture of a gun and cut it out 
and was threatening kids with it 
and so they suspended him 
yeah 
uh 
it's it to me that's sort of a slap on the wrist and you tell the parents what you've done it what the kid did and you don't want him to do it again and let it go 
they suspended him i don't know 
course 
um i probably say this 
i got this version of the story from the columbus dispatch so it's probably not the whole story 
yeah 
it it is 
well 
and if you want something local that's all you 
got 
i mean there's one paper 
i don't even read it much 
it's very conservative very republican 
yeah 
then there's 
probably columbus it's 
it's 
it's the democrat 
yeah franklin county usually votes differently than the rest of 
at least the metropolitan areas of the state 
yeah 
oh okay 
yeah 
i 
well and it's not just in the schools it's in society 
i mean violence seems to be an answer to a lot of things 
and i  
i i just 
can't 
it's hard to imagine that the 
there's an easy fix if there is a fix i 
it's kinda frustrating because 
you can't point to one thing and say this is what needs to be fixed 
you know it's pervasive 
it's like the 
i don't know if you've heard about this in the news a woman 
two of them were having an argument and one of 
one of them set fire to the other one 
it was real close to my home 
it's the grocery we 
yeah 
no i haven't been over there since then 
yeah 
but it's like 
i mean you 
there's these stories almost everyday you hear them 
and that's 
i mean that's even a big change from five or ten years ago 
or maybe it's 
well 
or maybe it's crime that's going down in the sense that it's supplying 
you know it's 
criminals aren't as active but there's more and more of these 
acts of violence 
maybe it's because they're so dramatic 
that you notice it 
yeah 
yeah i mean maybe break ins are down 
or holding up seven elevens are down but 
then you hear these you know 
murders 
and then they seem like random or just spontaneous  
there's no way  nothing you can do in life to really avoid it except  
hide in your basement or something 
and that's 
you know 
and that's not a life 
right 
and you  got it walking down the street 
yeah 
there seems to be an awful lot of 
publicizing some of it i mean some of it's pretty dramatic a woman setting fire to somebody what happened in columbine 
it's very dramatic but 
when it happened in columbine it was 
all that was on the  
for a whole 
day   seemed like you 
anywhere you looked 
that's where it 
thing 
loose a little 
there 
uh 
and that's 
all you could see and it was like 
well how much do  
how much new is there to say from minute to minute on every channel 
how much do people really need to keep hearing it 
and so i think it gets driven home i think the media does that in a lotta places they pick something that's sensational  
keep  
they're making it 
even more sensational like 
when 
john kennedy died 
fortunately we were out 
we 
weren't 
in the country so 
we didn't know so 
we had 
heard just 
well we were uh 
we weren't that far we were in vancouver so it's not that far away 
we didn't hear about it for a couple days but i heard that that's 
all that 
was on 
every aspect of his life every aspect of the search 
did people really need to know that 
do they need to have it driven  
and i think in  and i think at that point that's where the media are just 
they're sensationalizing it  
oh 
everyday 
there was something 
it's like 
i felt felt like i knew more about clinton's sex life than i knew about my own 
and it was far more then i wanted to know about anybody else's 
where as you know in the past there's been presidents who had affair the press never even acknowledged it even if they knew it 
i mean at least that's what 
ya 
we hear 
um 
and now that's 
the most newsworthy story out there 
so i think yeah the press have a lot to do with it 
the media 
well hide in your basement i guess 
and  i  but i mean what 
you can 
not as an individual 
uh 
well see that's a problem 
it's hard to find a balance between censorship and 
you know free flow of information 
uh 
and as long as people 
i mean some people 
like this information uh 
jerry springer's still running 
which i i actually kind of enjoy watching 
when i get the  
it's kind of 
interesting to watch these  
um 
but i mean 
i mean where do you draw the line what people should see and not see 
i don't know 
i don't want somebody telling me i can see something or telling me what my kids can see 
uh i that's my job 
and if i don't wanna see something on tv i will turn it off 
if i don't want my kids to see something on tv 
we will i have an argument 
it used to be easy when they were little you know now 
you know 
you're dealing with a a twenty one year old an eighteen year old is not as easy 
yeah 
yeah 
you're much bigger 
and you can control the thing and keep it away from her 
uh 
yeah but 
but i don't want somebody else telling me what 
they can watch and not watch that's my job 
but i don't know how you i mean the 
the media  supposedly i mean 
may 
not supposedly this may be the way it works the media presents this stuff and people watch it or read it  
or whatever they don't 
but it's when it's like the constant barrage that this is what you get 
the monica lewinsky stuff and 
every day there was a new twist on the story that 
or they announced that the news was that there wasn't a news twist 
yeah 
i don't care 
but you couldn't turn it off because that's all that was on 
i don't know 
well they are now in a sense 
uh 
it's easier to 
to go somewhere else i think on the web on tv if you have you know like 
four news  
four local news channels and they're all saying the same thing 
and emphasizing the same things there's no 
choice there if you want the news you're gonna get it one way or the other but on the web you can go somewhere else 
uh 
and you know major newspapers are all over the web 
uh 
you can pick and choose and you can see different 
perspectives on the same story from different parts of the country and 
i think you get a a wider view 
yeah 
well yeah 
yeah 
oh that was the monica lewinsky 
i think it's been good i mean the economy has been very good 
uh 
it seems like society seems to be 
improving 
you know even though we talked about this 
crime and stuff 
i 
i mean a lot of it is just a strong economy now that may have started during the republican years and carried over 
um 
but people have been better off financially 
overall 
uh 
and i and i don't think he's made anybody i don't i wouldn't say he's made any 
major mistakes 
policy wise well 
yes the 
his personal life 
he's well 
yeah 
he's really just 
yeah he just doesn't think through the implications of things real well in his personal life 
well 
yeah he does back down too often 
i think 
uh 
you uh 
well 
you know the well the health insurance didn't have a chance 
i mean  
no matter what position he took on the health insurance trying to radically change things it wasn't gonna get through congress 
and so yeah he backed down but i would've liked to have seen something else happen to it 
but it was also he i mean he gave up because it was 
it was useless to fight it 
he didn't think it wasn't gonna get through congress 
so 
why spin your wheels on that 
i mean he raised the issue 
it was clear that it wasn't gonna go anywhere 
and maybe it will  
it's i think it's regrettable it hasn't come back 
yeah but 
he's 
pretty much out of the picture now 
as of this week 
um 
the gays in the military 
i mean they've always been there 
i really 
uh they've always been there 
um 
i don't have problems being around gays 
um 
i never have my 
you know 
have a brother in law who's gay my 
son's godfather's gay 
it's not a problem 
um 
oh clinton's position on it 
well he sort of backed down from what it was gonna be and then 
just hoped that it would drop and 
i mean what 
what you hear and read lately is that it really hasn't changed much 
uh 
and it but again that's i think part of that too is society's not ready 
on some level to accept that 
i mean gays in the military is one thing but then people are talking about gay marriages and 
well uh 
was it was 
they actually had a law or they 
or was it referendum 
oh really 
i hadn't heard that 
know it it uh 
some of it when clinton has backed down i think i 
sort of summarized what i just said is 
you know for the health 
insurance and reform with that 
all that health insurance 
area 
um 
yeah he backed down but it wasn't gonna happen 
so he could keep 
know the furor going for months and months or years 
and 
still nothing was gonna happen it was the wrong time 
or  try to move on to something else 
uh 
i think it's regrettable it hasn't come back 
like you said it's like 
well i made the one attempt and didn't go anywhere so let's let it drop and 
count for somebody else to pick it up well 
clinton's in 
lame duck it's 
why can't he bring it back 
it's a good  i mean what are they gonna do 
i mean he's been through enough hell on his personal life this can't be much worse i wouldn't think 
uh and he does  he does back down i think too much on stuff like that 
and 
you know 
that's a  time 
if they can't say it in three months they can't say it in eight months 
oh george oh 
w 
i don't know i haven't 
really formed an opinion i can't 
i can't see a lot of substance 
uh 
he seems to say what needs to be said at the time and then 
sort of  
not really backtrack it's just like it's not anything really firm 
i mean with mccain and bradley they were saying they wanted to do this and this was what 
the points they wanted to make and that 
i don't hear that coming from bush 
well i don't 
i hear some of that from gore but not as much 
it will be a  campaign 
i thought it was interesting that 
that gore suggested   suggested 
two  two debates a week and i just can't imagine 
watching two debates a week for months 
it's like 
well 
at least they could get things out into the open but 
i 
they have the chance but who wants to watch that much 
who has the time to watch that much 
yeah 
i don't think we need eight months and we need to start the campaign even a year before the primaries it's just 
too long 
uh 
people start tuning out 
and there's only so much you can say 
you know it's like the candidates 

aren't really saying much new where if they have a more compact time they could be so i'd like to see them 
see the time reduced 
the conventions used to be interesting because they debated the platforms and 
that's all settled now 
and it's just sort of a 
you know the celebration type stuff well that's not 
interesting 
well 
they couldn't 
change and move the primaries 
like to may 
well that's 
it's competition to be earliest and the  
the federal government's trying to stay 
stay out of the state's 
face and 
so again that's another one of those things that 
just live with it i mean there's enough of there's enough things to do and fight in were it life but that's not worth it 
ya know 
that's 
probably what i will do ignore it   till like 
august or july and then start paying attention 
yeah 
wait right 
the amount of money that is spend is just 
i could just can't imagine 
uh ya know millions and millions have been spent already 
hundreds millions and 
it's just starting 
my background 
mean 
yeah i grew up in columbus i was born here 
uh went to went and here at 
o s u at  
for school as an undergrad 
yeah i went to columbus public schools 
uh didn't 
yeah 
um um 
always over on the west side same area of town 
always lived there  live there now 
um 
came up here to o s u 
um 
got my bachelors in uh 
english lit 
and then went to case 
western reserve for a masters 
then i decided i wanted to go somewhere else in the country 
after i got my library degree 
and the only job i could find was here in 
it was a  
was real tight job market for librarians then 
yeah 
well it's good now 
uh 
well the web again has changed that there's 
computers 
have made a big difference 
uh it's more exciting now 
for people who in that area um 
who are interested in 
it's more emphasis on 
information not books and 
things  going to the library it's 
getting the  
making information available so it's 
i think it's attracting a different group of people and it's 
it's 
more interesting 
um 
but it was real 
tough job market then so i ended up at the state library downtown 
worked there for five years and decided i  
wasn't anything else there for me 
uh and got a job at this company  which was still relatively new there were like 
hundred hundred and fifty employees 
was in seventy eight 
um 
and then i've just 
i have 
stayed there and it's 
grown a lot and the work changes it's an interesting place to work because 
uh 
well first the job is almost a different job every year 
because so many changes are happening we're trying to stay out in front of what 
in front of what library innovations in front of web 
and net  and trying to incorporate 
all so it's 
it 
ya know it's 
kind of exciting because you're  getting in on things that are really new and 
trying to master it the project i'm working on now 
um 
it's trying to find a way  
to automatic to 
create data that describes 
web resources 
so that libraries can take this data and put it in their catalog and integrate it with the regular collection 
and we're doing a lot of 
with a 
yeah it is it's pretty 
it's pretty neat project a lot of new things 
who at 
uh java and the web 
give us 
opportunities do things that we've talked about before but 
couldn't really do very well 
so it's pretty neat 
yeah 
well we didn't even have computers 
at our desks we had terminals that connected to a system 
yeah 
yeah it was 
uh 
and ya know you 
and isn't very ya know it was very slow and 
and 
key in a few characters and send it and wait and 
much different now 
very different 
uh 
just been a lot of innovations and 
mmhmm 
my first job over here at the o s u main library was key punching 
for the system they have now key punching the old card data into that 
that was my first 
first library job 
i started at the real bottom of it 
yeah 
and i don't  
uh it's 
yeah 
you just sit at the computer and 
key the data in or 
well the system we're doing now is you can put in like 
um the address the u r l for a web resource 
it goes out and extracts data analyzes what's there 
and comes up with 
ya know subject terminology and call numbers and 
presents it back to you and then you can edit and do whatever you want with it 
so 
ya know it's 
it's doing some of that 
some of that the automatic assigning and 
subject headings and call numbers that's 
that's a lot of 
we're doing a lot of research on that it's 
got a ways to go it's getting better 
um 
it's i mean it's a lot better than it was even a year ago 
uh 
well we put all kinds of information out on our own website 
which there's so much it's very hard to find what you want 
ya know it's 
that's a constant problem with information is 
the more you put out there the harder it is to find what you want 
but if you can't get to it 
if it's not out there you can't find it 
uh 
it it's a problem for us and for libraries because there's just a barrage of what they're getting and it's not just from us it's from the literature 
uh 
there's literally  
ya know 
hundreds of library publications 
uh 
and it's a problem that 
librarians are facing all the time they can't keep up 
there's too much information and too much change 
uh librarians 
and this is against probably of the image of librarians are they're very 
very 
eager to embrace change 
uh 
internet came out and 
ya know 
and when it 
and when it got out of the area that was being used by universities or whatever for research that's what it was at first 
librarians were right there they wanted more and more and they wanted to figure out what they could do with it 
um when p c's 
we didn't 
you know it was revolutionary when we announced we were gonna use i b m p c's 
for access to the system and we provide you software you can do some of the work that you used to doing but 
with us 
in your computer 
and it's like it was incredible that 
i mean 
we had trouble with the demand it was  
ya know like triple what we expected 
librarians were ready for it 
yeah make their job earlier and faster 
uh 
ya know and  libraries like 
so many other places especially at universities or 
they've seen budget problems and 
the subscriptions for  
periodicals are just outrageous 
some of those 
triple every year 
yeah 
yeah they do 
well that's what 
that's what they've done 
well they've done that here too they've done every university 
well 
right but the ones that are raising are the ones that are the standards in the fields 
but 
right 
and but more and more those are also available 
on the web but you have to subscribe to them 
so it's still and institutional subscription 
i mean that's a constant problem for the serials people everywhere i mean 
just it's incredible what's happened with the costs 
ya know 
i mean i've seen 
articles that say some of them have gone up a thousand dollars a year 
but if you do that to 
ten things it's some but it's in 
integral to the university's collection 
that really hits your budget 
ya know 
and then there's always the professor who wants a particular journal because they like it 
that you really didn't need 
because then you could get more bang for your bucks 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah we do a lot of inter library loan too 
that's it 
oh okay that was easy 
yeah it was easy 
yeah it was yeah it was interesting 
i usually don't have trouble  

is that 
just to get a volume level 
excuse me 
on right and 
yeah 
okay 
uhhum 
oh 
here in columbus yeah i've  i've always lived in columbus yeah 
west side 
yeah 
eh 
not really 
he's kind of between the west and the south area southwest yeah 
uh the area i live in's uh now is the west gate area 
uh we grew up on the hilltop area 
right now i live in the west gate which is a little further west 
yeah 
it's gone downhill a lot 
uh 
yeah they uh near  
near west side is 
always been in 
pretty bad area well in the last forty or fifty years and it's starting to creep west 
into the hilltop area 
yeah 
we were just talking about that last night my wife and i been thinking that another five years we might wanna get out of here 
yeah 
we're buying it yeah 
and we should have it paid off about five years so 
we're talking about moving someplace 
a little simpler to take care of 
a condominium or something 
one floor plan 
yeah it's seventy years old 
um 
so there's always something going wrong 
with the wiring or the plumbing or the something 
and uh 
it seemed like a good idea about twenty five years ago to get a house a 
older house 
but 
uh no not anymore 
uhhum 
oh yeah 
i've uh one son nineteen 
he's trying to find himself 
there's been a lot of uh 
a lot of problems with him he's a 
brilliant kid 
uh they told us in elementary school he had the highest i q they'd ever had tested 
he's very creative uh 
very talented musically 
uh 
he was taking lessons from um 
gene walker that teaches jazz saxophone here at the university 
and he said that he thought charlie had the makings to be a  to make a living 
career as a jazz saxophonist 
uh but there's 
also in the last four years or so a lot of uh mental health problems 
crept up multiple 
health problems 
he ran away for a while there was drug abuse 
alcohol 
and uh he was essentially asked to leave high school 
uh and he went to columbus alternative which is considered one of the 
top high schools in the state and he was asked to leave 
um he  in a psych ward for a while 
uh 
in some ways he's seemed to have gotten it together 
um 
uh he's working full time at united dairy farmers 
um 
he's involved with an uh 
very much involved with uh having a baby in another month 
uh well not 
not really she's only sixteen and he's nineteen she 
quit high school the end of ninth grade 
uh within a few months had her g e d 
is filling out forms now to start 
go to college in the fall 
uh 
in becoming uh an engineering 
uh 
tech 
she's looking at two or three different areas so i'm 
not sure which 
uh she can't convince him to  he says he needs the g have a g e d 
but he 
hasn't done anything about 
think he 
we've always had the feeling that he had a uh um 
a fear of failing 
because he was so good at anything that he really wanted to do 
that the areas that he was not good at 
math for 
instance is an example 
he just got very frustrated with and just wouldn't try 
uh he's very talented he's had artwork published 
poetry published 
um 
he's won 
he won a statewide award 
a gold medal for 
bagpipe playing 
yeah 
he's doing none of that anymore 
so it's very frustrating for us and the baby they're giving up for adoption 
so that's a 
whole different 
problem 
not really 
uh he's come to accept it 
but uh it was her decision 
yeah it was one thing to know that it's the best thing for the baby 
but it's another thing 
my wife and i are trying to deal with emotionally that 
we're very family oriented 
that this is a grandchild we will never 
get to see watch grow up and that's very hard on us 
but it's is an open adoption 
uh they've met the couple several times 
uh they've promised to ya know send pictures and keep 
keep them updated and stuff like that so 
uh westerville 
yeah 
so 
that's difficult for us to deal with 
and and i'm gonna hold you to this confidentiality cause 
very few people know about this 
my brother knows about it and my mother and that's the only ones in my family that are even aware of it so 
because 
we just don't wanna be bothered with a lot of questions 
cause it's hard for us to deal with 
no this all started long before that actually 
just recently he seems to 
have accepted the idea that yes the baby's gonna be born i i think he just kind of 
tried to ignore it for a long time but 
it's all very obvious now 
um 
and she's 
she's great 
we really like her and she has helped us straighten him around a lot 
he has been under a psychologist's care for about 
three years 
and a psychiatrist for about a year and a half 
she's very bright she's very  she comes from an extremely dysfunctional family her um 
parents divorced when she was about four 
her mother's an alcoholic her father said that he would 
take her  
with him and then after they got divorced he changed his mind so she's pretty much raised herself 
it's a  
it 
it's terrible things what she's 
to go through 
and she's made it very clear that 
she will not live with an alcoholic 
and that's helped straighten him out some 
and our feeling was never that 
the alcoholism or the 
the drugs 
was not the problem 
and we've dealt with several counselors and that's all they wanted to deal with our 
has always been it's a symptom 
uh 
took the psychologist a year and a half but he finally 
charlie is 
he's very intuitive 
and  even as a toddler he could do this he  
he'd 
seemed to be able to give adults what they needed from him 
as a toddler and it's 
it's not intentional it's just the way he is 
so he was able to circumvent anything that the psychologist was trying till he had finally admitted it yeah he had a problem 
and then things went much more smoothly 
and that there's still not 
really 
convinced of the diagnosis cause there's multiple problems and 
they haven't ruled out that some of the other things yet 
he could he just knew how to get around anything 
yeah it it's 
it's 
to deal with 
he was tough but he was uh he was always tough and we didn't realize it for years we didn't have anything to compare to he's the only one kid we got 
uh he was 
very 
the psychologist told us that 
ya know we were talked about things that happened when he was growing said you must had a terrible time  
raising him cause he was not an easy kid we didn't know any different 
was our job 
so we 
it's well he's always had some problems it's 
um 
his problem's staying focused on things 
unless it's something he's extremely interested in then you can't get him away from it 
um 
if it's something he 
it's 
the 
just an example in school he would sit there and 
he'd be rolling around on the floor and stuff while they're trying to teach something in class or  
working on a writing assignment or something 
and half hour to work on it he'd be 
the last five minutes 
the teacher say you know you really need to get that done he'd 
sit down and write it 
the fifth grade he was writing on a college level and 
he'd could do it that quickly 
um 
i think he's lost ground on that now but 
and that was just an example in the second grade 
the school he went to was an open classroom 
and uh 
he had been through some couple the traditional schools already 
and the 
principal said we had told the  talked to the principal about the problems we were having with him 
staying focused and she said well we can work with that well  about halfway through the year she says it's not working 
and they have an arrangement and with 
and 
i 
doubt if most the  
people in the  parents in the school are even aware of this with childrens hospital 
the counseling center they set a room aside and they 
send counselors in once a month to work with the students 
it's open classroom 
it's experimental so there's people coming and going all the time and no but how we were never aware of it i i doubt if most the people are aware of it 
and they met with us and then a week later they went and observed him 
and 
he was they were 
the teacher was telling a story and then asking questions about 
and said he was 
the counselors said he was up and walking around and running around and 
playing with his shoes and stuff like that she said but if came time to answer the questions he knew every answer 
so he said he that they decided not to precede at that time because 
this is frustrating too 
it was our wedding anniversary and my wife said now how about for our wedding anniversary 
we just get a good report for the whole week 
but that was unusual 
and he wasn't 
a bad kid 
he's just disruptive 
and uh 
he said 
okay 
week later she said we didn't get any bad reports thank you and he said she said are you gonna continue he said yeah it's a lot easier 
for the rest the year we got no bad reports from 
first grade 
the first grade teacher was aware of what he needed and but the principle wouldn't let her give it to him 
to give him something had to do what everything anybody else in the class was doing 
he was even tutoring some of the kids in first grade 
and 
it 
the last grading period she'd give him 
everyday she'd give him a  math 
paper to work on and he said i showed you i 
i know how to do this i'm not doing it 
we were up talking to her almost daily 
on the phone 
in her office 
and the ya know the last week he  she said you know there's only one week of 
school left she said well i better do my work and sat down and did it 
it's 
extremely difficult to deal with 
uh 
and he had been through a counseling experience before and it  and it 
he just played along with it then 
to get out of it i think that 
he does 
and 
his love  
he 
he 
his music is extremely good he 
taught himself so he by ya know 
sixteen he's playing eight instruments 
very well 
uh he just 
and he can't do that now where he lives now he lives with 
uh this  thing that boggles my mind 
his uh 
girlfriend's mother she he's afraid her  his girlfriend that her daughter was gonna run away so she let's them sleep together in their house 
when she her daughter was fourteen 
uh 
yeah 
it's a little hard to accept 
um 
you know i   it's it's hard to know what he's going through 
how much of it 
um 
normal 
teenage rebellion 
and how much of it's just 

and plus the mental health 
aspect of it and everything 
and some of that's controlled with medication now but 
not all of it 
because they because of the drug and alcohol they won't put him on some of the medications so 
but as far as i can tell he's been pretty clear and clean on that end uh 
you know like 
once she got pregnant they both stopped smoking 
she's taking very good care of herself she uh 
she 
lately has been going with him to the psychologist 
and oh 
uh we've been paying for it but we don't have a problem with that 
because he's 
he likes the psychologist so 
took a long time to get to that point but 
uh 
so we've been talking to the psychologist about it and he said this should be 
he said 
most people that raised in that background he said they go two different ways ones they 
they just fall into the same 
uh pattern as their parents or they're survivors she appears to be a survivor 
uh 
she's never really had 
what i would call a normal family relationship she likes to spend time with us 
uh which i'm glad 
uh 
and she we really like her she's 
really 
it 
we enjoy being with her but 
sometimes more than being with my son 
uh 
so it 
it's been very difficult 
for us particularly the last four years and 
about the time he ran away 
was er between the time my father in law died and my mother in law died which was in a five month period so my wife's had an awful lot to deal with 
um 
she's had a lot to deal with in that time 
yeah 
yeah 
plus a lot of work stress that she's had and stuff 
uh she works at franklin university she's assistant vice president there 
so there's been a lot of pressure there 
every time she thinks she's got it fully staffed and everything covered somebody quits but uh 
and that's what the main problem's been 
yeah 
i retired about uh four years ago 
from the state i worked there for thirty years actually i started working for the state when i school here 
i worked here 
and that   counted  those five years counted towards retirement so i was able to retire early 
and then the last uh about the last two and a half years i've been working the symphony 
in the box office 
started part time and then i was full time for a while and then 
i requested to be cut back to part time again 
because uh 
i don't need to work that many 
i 
right i didn't need to 
so i didn't want to 
uh 
i'm fifty two 
yeah 
i was forty eight when i retired 
so it's great 
it's terrific 
uh 
uh 
all those years and 
after i left at school 
here i was at the bureau of employment services i worked for about uh 
twenty years 
with uh 
research and statistics labor market information uh federal state programs collecting information on 
three different programs in that time 
then i worked for about a year and a half on a special project 
uh 
they were automating the employment services activities and they were going in a complete different  direction to match um 
job needs of employers and 
applicants 
to 
to get 
more placements for interviews and that sort of thing 
and i developed 
that 
method the the mechanism that check lists and stuff i did uh 
worked on that 
uh 
and i worked for the last three years in jobs training 
uh for economically disadvantaged youth adults and dislocated workers 
the 
uh 
technical assistance and policy end of it 
and 
hated it 
the other years were fine but those last three were pretty bad 
uh 
oh yeah 
and they are actually offered an early retirement because the funds 
i don't  
you may not remember about three years ago 
four years ago the 
the federal government was not gonna pass a budget and all this stuff so when that doesn't happen on budget  
cuts in at seventy five percent of what the previous year budget was or something like that 
more money than they were gonna give us before that 
uh 
so 
they had to  
they would either have go lay off people or offer retirement 
so i took the retirement 
because i was not happy there anyway 
so 
then 
took couple months off and did some consulting 
was worked on a consulting project at a borden's for 
about six months 
then when that project ended 
just 
same time it ended my 
father in law was diagnosed terminally ill with cancer 
and he needed daily treatments here in columbus and they don't 
they were from chilicothe so 
uh 
i became his caregiver for about three months till he died 
and then took a couple months off and started working part time at the symphony 
have been since then 
answered an ad in the paper 
uh 
but i've sung in a 
well shawn sings in the symphony chorus too 
i've sung in it for sixteen years 
um 
so i just you know was something i was a little familiar with anyway 
uh 
i was just looking for something part time 
so it worked out well 
it is really is 
it really is great 
i just haven't enjoyed it you're right yeah before that i was fine if i ever still it if i i made a mistake by applying for that one job i just wanted to get something different because i didn't wanna go back where i was well i would've been better off back where i was 
i would've been better at the job for one thing 
and i knew uh knew  
kind of insanity i'd be dealing with there 
oh uh 
yeah 
yeah i applied for it and went after it aggressively 
uh 
i was good in the 
i mean 
i knew what i was doing i kind of wish i hadn't been as prepared but 
uh 
but it was 
a lot of the  i moved into a management position 
i was in it was a lateral move wasn't even a pay raise or anything it was a lateral move 
and the people that i was supervising some of them been doing it for twenty years 
and they made it very clear to me that 
they knew the program and i didn't 
and uh 
and  you know i was there for 
three months before i got hit with a 
uh 
uh  
discrimination suit and 
but then i found out later this woman had 
in the twenty years she been there had filed twenty suits so 

she couldn't  accept the fact that you could just disagree with her 
it had to be because she was black or she was an older woman or 
you couldn't just disagree 
had to be a reason there 
but fortunately  
she accused me of that in front of my boss who was black 
who 
didn't believe it 
he knew better so 
yeah 
yeah it did and then she  
but she was 
kind of a gossip she went around talking to everybody trying to get them all support her and nobody would support her 
they'd uh heard it all before and they 
some of them had known me for a few years 
but 
uh 
i was told  i retired that she was actually easier to get along with when i was there than anyone else 
i don't believe 
yeah 
uhhum 
well i wasn't i was in  for about thirteen fourteen years and it wasn't bad where i was before 
uh 
this management it was it was the whole department it was uh 
i don't know what it was people they were always arguing and fighting it was just the whole 
atmosphere like of that place and it was just 
people that i'd known for years and gotten along well with were just 
they were different when they went in there they just changed it was just 
it was just not a good place to work 
yeah 
yeah 
i think there's been a lot of mistakes made by everyone on that 
and i really think 
even though i 
would hope there was a better way to handle i think they did the right thing by taking him away from the  
the cousins 
i mean they've the cousins have been stressing all along he needs family he needs family well there's not much closer family than your father 
and that that that they love this country and this stuff well then 
accept the laws and follow them whether you 
agree with them or not 
um 
i  
i 
i it was very unfortunate the way it happened uh but i think the government should 
not 
let it go on as long as it had 
right 
its the way i feel 
yeah 
we were talking about this at work one day and they said you know i'm  
surprised you think that way because 
i 
tend to be a little left of center on most things 
sometimes far left but 
and 
i said now this isn't 
i she said 
seems like that would be the conservative view my opinion the conservative view is 
they don't want him to go back to cuba 
not to the communism or 
but people i've talked to even 
extreme conservatives 
and liberals they all pretty much feel the same way that the ones i've  i haven't heard anybody 
that's accepted the other 
the cousin's side yet 
right 
yeah but it 
the conservatives and liberals are all agreeing on this 
that's what 
i 
it's not a presidential  candidate issue as far as i'm concerned but 
uh 
i'm 
oh yeah 
even my mother who is a 
she said if nixon were running today she'd vote for him she's that much of a conservative 
uh 
agrees with what's happened 
but most people will say the same thing there should have been another way to get him out of there but 
at this point i don't think there really was 
a 
a few months ago yeah but 
i think the news media have hyped it up too much really 
i mean we have an accord with cuba that says anyone that's 
trying to escape from cuba to united states that's found at sea is immediately returned to cuba 
whether you agree with it or not 
that's the accord and that's what  that's what 
castro's 
that's the premise he's operating on 
uh 
you know and the news media they haven't really been 
a 
they just 
they haven't been real objective about it 
i mean 
uh 
you know like there two fisherman that 
found him at sea you never hear about the other one because that this was on one 
just briefly i heard on the news because 
he thinks he should go back to his father 
but you don't hear about him 
there's three cousins two of them think he should stay 
miami the other one thinks he should go back with his father you don't hear about him 
i was reading about him 
news week or someplace 
uh 
so i think the news media is not been 
totally objective about this 
oh sure 
i'm sure 
uh 
right 
it's it's 
it's more a 
it tends to be more of entertainment 
i don't remember that being that way thirty years ago but 
it does now 
right 
well 
that's something i've noticed in the local news particularly  they say exclusively on our channel and stuff 
and it's usually not that big of a deal what they're talking about uh but they're making a big point that you heard it here first and 
i mean if you hear it five minutes earlier on one station than another what difference does it make 
i'm just kind of appalled what they put on the news anyway it's not 
usually what i consider news 
it's lot a human interest stories and things like that which 
nationals getting that way too they're all heading that way anymore 
uh 
used to be an 
analysis with the news you don't get that at all anymore 
right 
the 
kind of the u s a today syndrome 
light news 
uh 
that's why i read 
tend to read the alternative newspapers and things because you do get a 
different perspective it's 
it's 
probably just as slanted 
but it is different 
you're right 
uh usually whatever ones i can find 
uh 
hey you got 
columbus alive and 
just not quite that 
yeah the local ones more than anything 
uh 

oh no 
never have 
years ago there was a  i don't know if you were 
what your background is where you  
were here but or not but 
citizen journal was a daily paper 
and it was 
it was the opposite of the dispatch 
was much more liberal 
they used this and 
it 
it was a morning paper and the dispatch is an afternoon paper 
evening paper 
and uh 
they shared the same facilities 
the same printing presses and everything and then dispatch 
when their lease expired wouldn't renew their lease 
uh 
and at least it gave you a lot different 
view 
uh 
but the dispatch 
the only reason i get the dispatch is i do wanna know what's going on locally 
you 
right you 
you you can't really ignore 
i've heard people say i refuse to read the dispatch well you got to know what's going on locally i'm sorry 
but uh 
the day your trash is picking up 
what movies are playing 
uh 
but i don't really rely on heavily for news 
even they don't get facts right a lot of time 
uh 
oh not very right on 
and 
i would 
twenty the twenty years the first twenty years i worked at the bureau 
i was worked in statistics 
so i learned a lot about 
numbers and how to use them and 
what you can do with them how 
easily they're misinterpreted 
and my wife 
does it it has been a director of institutional research at the university 
um 
data 
research 
uh uh 
they don't really have other kinds of research there 
um 
and she says 
it's amazing you can 
give these  give people numbers 
and they immediately 
use them wrong 
they just don't know how to use them 
uh they 
completely misinterpret even though it's very clearly stated what they're doing 
and uh 
the newspapers do that a lot too 
people want a number 
they don't wanna know the methodology that goes into it 
or the the disclaimers or footnotes 
they don't wanna read the footnotes they want a number 
uh 
when i worked for the state one program we worked on was uh occupational employment statistics which was collecting uh 
numbers employees by different occupations in different industries in different areas 
of ohio 
uh 
which actually used 
originally started here the university in ohio it was a federal program department labor it was administered state level 
and uh 
it didn't 
didn't turn out very well so they switched it over to me 
uh 
for a variety of reasons which is not entirely the university's fault 
um 
they had to rely on confidential information which we couldn't give them because it was confidential 
uh 
by federal law it was confidential we couldn't give it to them 
but they needed it 
so it  it was just not a good one 
good way to do business 
uh 
and we would present information ok there 
for  
there's this this number of people in an occupation 
but there was also a range of error on there where people wouldn't notice that 
and they would take that number as gospel 
and you just could not convince them that 
well it really means more than that 
uh the big one would be uh wage levels and we didn't really 
at that time collect wage data so if we were kind of a conduit for 
there's several different departments in the 
the state 
and the federal government collect 
occupational data and we were kind of a conduit for the state for that 
um 
people would they wanted an hourly rate they didn't want a range they didn't want 
they uh they wanted a number and that's what that was gospel 
but it's based on survey data so and and you know there's always statistical error in there and stuff 
and 
try to explain that to we spent more time 
uh 
when people call up and give information explaining 
this is what this really means then the just giving them the number 
that we spent more time doing that 
uh 
i think a lot of people don't 
understand 
a lot of people don't 
it's a mindset 
uh 
uh 
they don't wanna deal with 
numbers a lot of people or they want something easy and simple 
and that's what they're looking for 
they don't really wanna know 
what it means 
uh 
and a statistic under 
any 
uh any 
definition really is nothing more than an average of some kind 
and people 
don't seem to understand that 
uh it's not like you're 
collecting data for a hundred uh the the entire population of the entire universe you you're working with a sample trying to 
represent the entire universe well 
sometimes 
it's good and sometimes it's not 
they tried sampling 
well my brother rich was one of the families they sampled 
yeah 
and it just didn't work 
and uh and the 
data they collect is just 
i mean 
well i mean there are some of those long forms that go into a lot of detail but 
the basic 
data has essentially how many people live in the household and what are their ages and race and that's it 
and that's not a 
i don't think that's a big secret myself but 
right 
and uh 
i think 
uh some of my feelings about that sort of thing is uh 
is is 
colored by the fact that i collected data 
for twenty years from 
employers 
uh 
i'm a lot more sympathetic 
to that sort of thing 
um 
yeah just lot more sympathetic to people collecting data 
yeah 
right 
i had did one time 
i had somebody call and they were doing a survey and they wanted know what i did for a living and when i told them they said well we're done 
we're finished 

right 
oh sure 
yeah 
oh 
that's not enough 
yeah and  and i think it could work 
uh but i don't think people were 
ready to accept it 
and if 
the people  giving the information aren't ready to accept it then 
it's not gonna work 
i'm not sure 
uh 
i'm not sure that the 
the federal government has the 
ability to convince enough people 
to do it 
and i don't think it's i i think the people that are going to be 
ready to accept it 
and 
go with it are 
i don't think  gonna get a 
good cross section population 
i think the people would be willing to understand it and go with it more if gonna be the more educated in this sort of thing then you're leaving out a large part the population so i'm not sure it's gonna give valid results anyway 
period 
and it's that's a long process i mean this has been going on for two hundred years this way 
uh 
and people are suspicious of government 
asking questions 
oh yeah and you just you just send that right on over but if you don't want to tell how many people live in your house 
right 
yeah 
see checking to see what kind of things you're ordering where you're 
hits are on the inter net 
and 
that's just because it's in the name of government 
they're suspicious and uh 
yeah 
it's 
difficult you feel alone a lot of the time 
um 
and i'm not as liberal as i used to be 
uh 
it's i think  
with age it gets tempered a little bit 
but still 
tend to be a little more liberal and it's uh 
you know 
it doesn't matter who i vote for they're gonna lose 
uh 
and i just stay out a lot of 
was  my 
our mother raised us 
in a way that we were always allowed to discuss 
politics and religion anything we wanted to 
uh but you know she'd stop if we got to point where we were 
getting physical or name calling or something like that and it was 
long 
after i left home i actually before i realized that not everybody's 
not everybody wants to hear your views 
um 
so i  particularly around my in laws they're very conservative 
of southern ohio 
uh 
raised during the depression 
um 
in a depressed area 
so it 
i've learned 
my mother in law 
took anytime you disagreed with her as a personal attack on her so 
i just learned 
you're not to say anything 
yeah 
uh 
my father in law wasn't that way but my mother in law was 
i think 
i think they do 
yeah 
my uh 
my brother in law was very much opposed to any kind of gun control 
uh the whole family was hunters hunters and things like that and now my 
father in law was a hunter 
but he was not opposed to gun control either 
uh 
as long as he could hunt 
and uh 
and they're not the kind that would go out and just shoot any animal 
shoot it they would 
use it food they sometimes they 
i know one time that 
they gave it to a family that was uh didn't have any money and didn't have any food they did 
went and killed some animals and gave it to and i don't have a problem with that 
uh 
uh 
but my brother in law was very much opposed to 
any kind of gun control 
he 
he believes whatever charleton heston tells him 
uh i think that 
i 
think that that you with all the violence in the schools and that sort of thing i think people are starting to look at it a little differently 
yeah and it's not 
i mean it gets it 
any is too much but it's not that big a proportion that it's happening 
but i remember even my son the third grade somebody kid brought a gun to school 
yeah 
he went to columbus schools uh 
uh 
and the kid didn't know what he had he just found it laying around 
his father's car in the 
glove compartment 
brought it in to show the other kids 
uh 
that was very upsetting to my son he's very sensitive 
uh 
he used to be 
again i don't know if that's normal for teenagers or not but he used 
used to be very sensitive to other people and 
but uh 
i don't think i 
i don't know if he is or he just doesn't 
won't let him be himself be right now but 
right 
uh 
oh yeah 
and that's normal we understood that we  knew we knew a lot of stuff we were gonna 
we raised him to be very independent 
and i always said that we're gonna regret this someday 
i said another ten years we will be pleased but 
uh 
we were not particularly raised either of us my wife or i to be very independent 
uh so it gets to point that 
when we were first married pretty it was hard to make it simple decision on anything 
you know we've worked through that after twenty five years but 
uh 
or to stand on our own or anything but 
you know we learned to do it but 
we always he was always very independent 
his teachers said 
independent we said it said stubborn but 
it's like even 
go to mcdonalds or something and he was 
didn't want onions on anything he 
if he ordered a 
a happy meal without onions and they put onions on it he would go up to the counter even as 
six and seven years old and 
and tell them 
uh 
which  we encouraged that 
because we could know that 
he will need that someday i would never have done it 
but it uh he he would he's 
and he's very opinionated 
and it's interesting when he talks about 
uh 
anything 
he loves to talk about politics and social issues and that sort of thing 
uh 
you can tell that he's thought he's uh thought about it 
and his 
you know clearly formulated what his stance is on it 
and he's 
very articulate about it 
uh 
sometimes 
his responses are immature but he's nineteen 
i mean 
i'm sure at nineteen i was saying some really bizarre things too 
uh but you can tell that he's thought about it 
so 
because he and i always discuss 
politics and stuff 
he had  
a variety 
uh 
eighth grade is when he was probably in some ways his better year 
uh 
he was taking a  
had taken computer class for grading period 
and um 
it wasn't going well they were teaching keyboarding well he learned that when he was in third grade 
so we were talking to the teacher about it says well he's disruptive he's supposed be doing keyboarding exercises and he's writing programs 
so anyways 
and he said i knew the first day he was in here he knew every  thing that i was gonna teach this 
grading period well that 
kind of flew up a red flag to me and 
can you give him other assignments 
oh no he's got do what everybody else is doing 
so we went to the principal and 
i was 
president of the 
uh parent's advisory committee at the time so i had an easy access to the principal 
he took him out of the class immediately and put him in the library and the librarian worked 
with him one on one teaching data base and spreadsheet 
uh 
applications to him 
but then 
but he had another teacher in the ninth grade who contacted us his english teacher 
and  she  said told us uh said he knows everything i wanna teach 
so i want your permission to give him a separate curriculum and she did she but he was 
using reading books like invisible man 
my  
Ellimen Ellison 
Ralph Ellison 
and Ellimen guess it is 
anyway um 
and writing papers on it he was reading like three books by an author and then trying to write a short story in that author's style 
and she still tested him with the other kids just make sure she hadn't missed any he hadn't missed anything 
and she was he was using her grad school notes to write papers and stuff like this 
and uh 
it was 
he loved it 
and that's what he needed 
though when he got to high school 
and we would talk to teachers about they said no they couldn't do that 
uh it was very frustrated 
frustrating 
in the kin 
in uh 
first grade his teacher 
knew that he needed that but the principal would not allow her to do it 
and that's one reason we put him in different school for second grade 
uh 
right 
yeah and uh 
in the eighth grade he took the ninth grade proficiency test and passed all four parts 
the first time 
uh 
so he was learning what they 
were 
teaching which and that's another problem teaching to a test but 
um 
that's a whole different problem 
uh 
right 
and you learn what you have to to get through the test course i did that 
when i was here at school 
uh 
if was a class i 
knew i had to take i didn't really want to 
that's what you do 
uh you just get through it 
uh 
uhhum 
yeah 
i was bored in high school and i wasn't all that bright 
and 
uh he needed 
that but uh if i uh 
it it was 
difficult 
uh 
i can't tell you how many times he had papers or projects due at school that we'd just have to sit there with him 
to keep him focused on doing it 
it's 
one of the 
uh 
diagnosises probably 
a d h d which has trouble 
with uh working memory how and how to get a project done and stuff like that 
uh we taught him how to do time lines and 
charts and things like that 
um 
but it was very difficult for him be task oriented 
and it still is 
uh and that was the problem with school he just wouldn't do the work 
i mean he give him a test and he could pass it 
do really well but 
he just wouldn't do the work 
well he wasn't really diagnosed then until just the last couple years uh 
and part of the problem was it was fairly new and everybody was being diagnosed a d h d uh and it wasn't really there weren't really good screening instruments for that there are now 
uh 
and we've often felt that he needed to have 
gifted 
emphasis for gifted children because 
uh 
and the uh 
the schools wouldn't do that for him because his grades weren't good enough because he didn't do the work 
and 
the state of ohio's definition of 
a 
gifted child is uh anyone who goes scores seventy percent or higher on 
some test that they give 
well uh you know they saying half the students in columbus schools were gifted students now that's not 
it can't it's impossible 
gifted students there's fourteen different characteristics to look at you can't just look at 
one thing 
and 
one of them they'd looked at in columbus was 
uh 
how well he was doing in school 
well gifted children you 
have the high uh one of the highest drop rate of 
out rates in schools they're not doing well 
so they need to be taught differently 
and then they cut this moneys uh 
my feeling is you know there's lot of 
programs in school there's sponsored by the federal government particularly 
uh to help the the students are that are behind and that's important 
and it should be important but there needs the students that are the other end need the help too 
lot of people think if you have a child that's gifted that all your problems are solved but it's not it's a different set of problems there's personality quirks that go with that emotional issues 
right 
and the they're not willing to do that for gifted students 
only if for those 
students who are  high achievers who are very bright 
talented may be truly gifted 
who are willing to 
jump through the hoops 
and those the and the other students were lost 
to the system 
and that's what happened with him 
and and it's just 
yeah 
well we figure in a few years he will 
um 
that's what we figure in a few years he will be fine 
it's just getting there 
it's been very difficult 
i mean there's times when we didn't know where he was 
for 
a week at  a week at a time he 
i was driving 
lane avenue once and saw him begging money on the street and 
that's 
it's it's hit pretty heavy load to go through it really is 
right 
no i had no idea where he was 
uh and at the time 
my mother in law was in a nursing home had alzheimers and my father in law was in the hospital 
uh essentially dying 
and so we were dealing with all of this 
at the same time and it was i mean there was one night i remember we were ready to leave the hospital about seven thirty we checked to see if there was any messages at home to see if we'd heard from him 
uh 
and got a message that my mother in law had fallen and she was in an 
emergency room the same hospital fortunately so went down there 
then on the way home 
got a phone call on the cell phone 
uh 
from the hospital that my father in law had to had some bleeding so we had to go back to hospital 
and then we went around driving around looking for my son this was all and this was not unusual 
it was a horrible period 
and uh 
i think what 
made my wife and i the angriest was that he's the only one that really could control his behavior the others couldn't 
and their needs were 
immediate 
he's admits now that he felt neglected at that period 
well 
how he felt and knowing that weren't neglecting him were two different things 
we've always emphasized that 
knowing what's right 
or knowing that 
what's just is one thing it's dealing with the emotions is another one 
like dealing the with this adoption of the baby we know that that's best but dealing with the emotions of it this is a you know it's grand 
we're very family oriented 
and it's this is a grandchild we will never see 
and it's very hard on my wife and i 
but we will get through it 
right 
yeah 
it's uh well you're right 
yes 
so it's tough to go through but 
he uh i guess he always did take things a little on the extreme 
so it's 
probably wasn't unexpected we just weren't prepared for it i don't think you could be prepared for it 
right and he just pretty much 
cut ties with all of his old friends and 
we still see them all uh a lot 
and we were close with their parents and 
hasn't for about four years he refuses to 
refuses to live with us 
because we have rules 
he seemed confused 
parenting with controling 
i mean we would like when he was fourteen years old we wouldn't let him go out and take a walk at  three in the morning and he couldn't understand that 
i'm 
i don't think that's being 
a bad parent 
to tell you no 
uh 

right 
and he did that too 
uh 
no and he 
you know he had he had 
he 
was living with this one family for a while 
um 
and they were nudists and taking him to nudist camps and stuff like this 
what do you think they would 
they never had any contact with us they just let him move in 
can you imagine letting your 
fourteen year  friend just 
move in 
and not 
find out why or 
i just 
he uh he did 
talk to one of his friends who 
he wasn't really a  did  didn't really know that 
this friends mother and i grew up together 
uh so he was 
he 
asked if he could move into their house and the mother said there were three things 
one i need something in writing from your parents 
two i need to talk to your parents 
and three there are rules you will have to obey 
of course that never happened 
i think he really does 
uh you know he's paying rent at his mother in law 
wasn't not really his mother in law but in her 
so she can 
right 
uh 
he's he has become more responsible 
but responsible about a lot of things 
which is again 
at normal maturation 
and he's just doing it the hard way 
he was 
you know pretty much promised a free ride through o s u's music program 
and he turned that 
and he's thrown that away 
and i 
i don't even know if he regrets that 
i really have no idea 
uh 
he just doesn't want talk to us about things like that 
he does talk to 
his girlfriend about it and she's become very close with my wife 
she's 
never had an adult 
really the 
um a mentor of any kind even 
my  she wants to go to 
school my wife's 
agreed to go with her when she goes for the interviews and stuff 
she says she doesn't know what to ask or anything and 
course my wife's worked in higher education for thirty years so 
and she wants go to columbus state 
uh wants to get into 
one of their engineering tech programs 
um 
um hum 
and i i hope she does 
um 
she  
she never fit in in high school she is very bright 
she's 
mature in  many ways but she's had to be responsible for herself her whole life 
um 
but she was never interested in 
and never really interested in boys or in sports in high school 
or uh 
make up 
and clothes and things like that and 
you know  
you're setting yourself up for ridicule in high school for that 
and that's what happened she'd come home in tears because kids made fun of her and stuff and finally 
she just stopped going 
and within a couple months 
she got her g e d 
may be kind of hard in a 
when she gets into a 
engineering tech program because she hasn't had all a the 
math prerequisites 
because she just didn't stay in school long enough 
i 
i think she yeah she will 
and  and she's very determined 
uh 
she has said that 
having this being pregnant having this baby has made her focus on things a lot differently 
she  she doesn't wanna go back to being the way she was before she doesn't want go back to the 
the drugs and the smoking and the drinking 
uh  all focus changes it really does 
and it never goes back to the way it was before did you just know that there's someone that's completely dependent on you for 
everything 
everything you do 
right 
right 
and she's taken very good care of herself she followed all the doctor's 
uh 
orders and 
she's very careful what she eats and 
and they've met the couple that's gonna adopt the baby 
which 
seems kind of odd to me but 
uh right and  they were actually able to select the couple from a they talked to  a lawyer who arranges adoptions 
and she had a file and they 
you know threw kind of a bunch of questions and answers type thing were to limit to 
down to three couples and they liked the first couple 
they met 
so 
right 
but uh you know with people 
coming back later and saying that 
uh 
they  changed their mind and stuff as the adoptive parents i'd be concerned about that but 
that's not gonna happen in this case i don't 
think 
and the 
because of her age and this makes no sense to me 
the state law says that she has to have custody of the child for seventy two hours 
before she can give it up for adoption 
uh 
because of her age and it 
doesn't make any sense to me but 
so the you know they're 
talking to a social worker now to find out they don't want take the baby home 
because they're afraid of being too attached to it then 
and they don't think it's a good  for it 
because her mother smokes constantly her mother's alcoholic 
um 
they 
no 
uh so she does not want 
to take the baby home so they're 
arranging some other things 
we have actually talked about taking the baby home ourselves for that time but we think that's gonna be too hard for us 
we even talked about adopting the baby 
but at our age 
that's 
i mean we'd be seventy years old when the kid graduates from high school 
uh and that wouldn't be fair to the kid 
and we were doing it for the wrong reasons too so 
we talked about it decided it wasn't a good idea 
i'm not sure i'm ready to go back through 
as much fun as it was the first time 
uh 
i just not 
ready willing to do that again 
it's a great experience it really     
even when 
you know we were having problems with him and stuff it was great 
uh he couldn't understand 
you know 
my wife's once said told him she says you know 
something about spending time together 
she 
she said that 
there is no time that we spend with you that's wasted 
and he couldn't understand that 
she said you mean this is fun i said i didn't say it was fun 
it's just not 
and uh 
i don't 
think he really understood that he might someday but 
yeah 
and i really think both of them will be good parents someday 
but she says 
we're not ready 
she's  
she's been very mature about it 
uh 
and she has 
they are working on an arrangement with the 
uh 
couple that are adopting baby will get 
counseling for her 
afterwards too and that's one things they've asked for in the 
adoption agreement 
and the 
couple's 
willing to do that 
oh yeah 
right 
and you know  
while the baby's in the hospital be covered under my son's insurance and she's covered under her father's insurance so 
their medical expenses are not gonna be very big 
so 

mmhmm 
okay 
i think so 
feels like it's too close to my mouth really but 
all right 
mmhmm 
mmhmm 
pretty much uh 
lived here my whole life uh 
i was born in sunbury and 
raised in gahanna and was in the service uh for four years uh 
so i actually came back here in nineteen seventy two and i been here since then 
i was born in nineteen fifty 
uh august twenty fifth 
and i'm divorced and i have a daughter be nineteen this year 
and then they live in saint louis 
mmhmm 
she will be nineteen in 
september 
far as i know she was 
planning on going to uh saint louis university which i 
want her to go to missouri university of missouri but 
but it's a uh 
smaller catholic school you know within 
saint louis so 
mmhmm 
i work at uh 
company plus i help out at the b v a vietnam veteran's association 
uh 
packing just working the  i'm in the uh 
warehouse 
packing stuff and uh 
in the b v a i just kind of 
do what needs be done you know help people out 
no i wasn't in vietnam but i was 
in during that time 
mmhmm 
mmhmm 
i was stationed uh permanent duty station was in north carolina 
uh 
you know i was  i was in like missiles and stuff so 
um 
mmhmm 
mmhmm 
well i was 
i was uh received my notice 
of drafting 
to uh to be drafted uh greetings 
you know you're gonna be drafted but my brother had just got back 
couple three years 
from vietnam so 
i enlisted in the air force 
mmhmm 
i went to o u for about three months but i just got out of school you know how it is 
no i didn't 
i 
know i didn't wanna go to school 
and partying sounded pretty good so 
so i ended up doing that for about three months and 
ended up flunking out of uh 
o u 
in the 
in the first three months of the first quarter so 
uh 
then i got my notice in january so 
mmhmm 
uhhum 
uhhum 
about my brother being in there uh 
being over there and everything you know he he was 
uh 
pretty upset that i did uh that i did that you know that i just went ahead and flunked out of school and uh 
and 
and he said 
you know 
enlist in something don't go in the damn army you know 
so 
yeah he knew it was a bullshit war 
uhhum 
much 
uhhum 
right 
well 
a long time ago uh 
when they had  signed the declaration and everything they said you know build a fence around your place and 
and take care of your own you know and 
i think basically that's the way the philosophy should be i think 
there's times when you need to be when we need to go help out other people but we try to be too much of a policeman now 
mmhmm 
you get into a 
situation where you really where there's a no win situation from the get go and uh 
uh 
i think that 
had we been able to 
do what we went over there to do initially 
it would've worked out okay but we weren't so 
so it became a political war as everybody knows that knows anything about it 
mmhmm 
yeah there was a lot of positive things 
uh from it as far as discipline as far as uh 
uh 
growing up 
faster and everything you know sometimes when i see a girl like my daughter or like other 
other 
people at that age you know and everything i 
you know they tend to act grown up you know or 
i felt like i was 
forced to grow up you know 
a little bit faster 
uh but 
and then in 
then when i get out of service like at twenty two you know i was kind of like behind everybody you know as far as my age group and stuff 
that didn't have to go 
and uh 
so 
i had  
had a lot of uh 
good times as far as that goes and 
you know cleanliness and next to godliness and all that stuff you know i mean a lot of people don't 
there's just a lot of lax 
stuff goes on today 
in my opinion but 
mmhmm 
mmhmm 
well i i think that 
my opinion is that if you ain't going to school and you're not going you're not working and everything you should uh 
be doing something besides 
causing problems you know 
and a lot of kids that's all they really wanna do nowadays is just 
cause aggravation to people 
the lack of discipline at the home 
well i've been  see i wasn't much i  
my 
being here and my daughter being there i didn't really have the uh 
time with her that i wished i would've had you know but uh 
uh 
her mother would you know wouldn't did her all right and everything but 
i wished that i would've been more involved in her 
growing up 
and 
i think two people families are generally better 
you know for 
not necessarily living being  you know its about being married and everything but 
at least being able to be a part of their 
your kid's 
mmhmm 
mmhmm 
well i believe it's quality not quantity 
uh 
ideally 
you know um one parent would be there be it 
male or female well you know man or  
man or  or lady 
but uh 
but you know your quality time's more important 
you know 
maybe go come home and you 
and all you wanna do is sit down and start watching tv or drinking beer or whatever you know and not spend any time with your child it doesn't matter 
you're 
there all day or whether you're there for two hours 
well i believe that's way it was originally set up you know so 
mmhmm 
i personally don't believe that they should be allowed to 
because i believe they they should have the male gender as well as the female gender 
for a proper bringing up 
balance 
uhhum 
i don't see any reason for it myself but uh 
that's 
interesting uh um 
you know when they when the first when the uh 
when time began you know according 
my  
uh 
what i believe in and everything you know it was 
man and woman got married you know and 
and reason they got married was because of procreation you know keep the 
keep the uh population going 
uh 
i think that's the way it was set up originally so 
i have no problem with a man being with a man or woman being with a woman but 
um 
if 
if that was the relationship 
for everybody 
uh 
then obviously the 
the civilization gonna be dead you know so 
mmhmm 
mmhmm 
well i've i've had gay friends and uh 
uh 
one of them worked at a t and t and he retired 
and then uh 
and the other one was on a disability and everything so uh 
that never even came up in their relationship 
nor did it come up in uh a  
another couple friends that i've had you know that they uh 
they more or less 
took care of each other you know 
so 
i don't agree with it we had gays in there when i was in there you know so 
yeah i mean you generally 
could 
i mean they didn't broadcast it obviously but 
you know they uh 
i mean my personally would i would personally wouldn't care you know as long as uh if i was in a foxhole with somebody i could care less whether he is gay or not 
as long as he's shoot a gun you know to help me out if i was in trouble so 
i think it's good and uh 
i've you know i think women are are capable of doing that my only 
disagreement with it is that i'd have a real problem 
being in that foxhole and have a woman beside me and 
uh 
she'd get shot you know i don't know how i could deal with that it'd be 
it 
men i don't know if you you 
you 
women have 
you know different feelings but with about each other than they do with men and men have different feelings about each other 
uh than they do with women and everything and they tend to be more protective 
so 
um 
where a man you know you kind of feel like he can carry his own weight you know a woman you may not 
you may 
feel like you have to 
do 
a special thing in order to uh 
uh to keep her from getting killed you know or something or  just shot or something 
so i wouldn't 
personally i don't like that myself 
but i ain't had no problem with them being like a pilot or something like that you know 
i wouldn't like it to be that way but uh basically when i was in the service the  the women uh 
had their own 
area of the service that they 
were allowed to be basically nurses and stuff you know 
uh 

and 
they had they you know they went through their own training and everything we didn't 
interface with each other or nothing like that you know i mean you might see one 
walking 
or marching somewhere but 
as far as fraternizing you weren't allowed to 
um hum 
um hum 
um 
no not really i mean different cultures and everything uh 
but 
i i went to school with blacks so i mean that wasn't that big a thing except for the 
influx 
of the you know 
i didn't realize how many 
were being drafted or being enlisting into the service at the time and everything or how many actually were even in the 
in the country you know 
but it didn't bother me 
uh 
religion's basically everybody when i was in there back in the sixties the i mean everybody was pretty much a christian you know christianity either catholic or something like that but uh 
nowadays you know you have the uh 
um 
more outspoken 
muslims and 
uh 
islam and uh  and judaism and everything so 
and there again i don't have a problem with that you know because you 
you got to 
meet yourself 
you know you got to make your peace with your maker because you know 
if you believe in religion you're 
you're here temporarily for an eternity later on you know 
um hum 
um hum 
well i  one thing uh you know being uh 
uh 
i came from basically a poor   poor uh 
uh lifestyle uh early life and everything you know so uh 
um 
if anything i guess it kind of made me negative uh 
towards people that 
had an influence had money 
and 
didn't do any 
thing good with it you know 
i'm a firm believer that if you got something that you should share it with other other people 
i don't always 
practice what i preach but 
you know that's 
i'd be a good philosophy to live by 
uh 
and people of other religions and everything um 
you know i learned a lot about religion when i  i was raised baptist basically but uh 
i 
practice more catholic than anything else now 
uh 
but i'm 
generally pretty knowledgeable about judaism and muslims and 
everything just because i find it 
interesting 
um 
you know was in sixty nines when i went in so 
you know you can 
kind of figure that it was 
the 
okay 
it was kind of uh 
it was different when i because see because when i went in 
uh 
and you know well i never had any problem with a black person or or i didn't really care you know as long as they uh 
did their job and everything i'm basically the same way today 
uh 
but people coming from other 
cities 
like chicago new york you know and places like that where they were 
treated poorly by whites you know they 
um 
they tended to 
act differently towards you and everything 
until they realized that you weren't like that you know 
uh we only had one racial incident when i was in the service uh 
where it was 
we were predominantly white 
uh 
platoon 
and 
the 
because we worked in missiles and stuff you know so uh 
and 
then 
the security cops were  
above us and they were predominantly black you know 
and i don't know what happened something 
happened one time there was only like twenty people in our 
whole uh 
platoon it was all in the same barracks 
and uh 
some guy said something 
off color to one of them or something like that you know and 
got kind of out of hand for a while but 
you know thank god nothing  really happened 
um hum 
i think that the 
i think society is today of today is less tolerant of uh 
a lot of things that they see where getting by with stuff you know 
and they're more vocal about it as opposed to being violent about it back in 
the sixties and stuff you know uh 
not here 
but you know down south there were people still getting 
hung and stuff you know for being 
a black or something and uh 
know there are bad blacks and there's bad whites too you know 
so 
but not all of them are 
you know 
are that way 
um hum 
but that's what i 
t v about and everything that stuff's been going on for years so 
um hum 
well i think it's more 
capable of being violent because of the uh 
information available to people about bombs and stuff like that you know or 
before you know if somebody got mad at somebody you know you 
might 
they might shoot them or something but 
not  a hundred innocent people for no reason 
um hum 
no i i personally don't because uh 
you know i've seen maybe not to the degree of the violence but mean i still knew it was violent uh 
stuff when i was kid you know that didn't make me a violent person 
so 
i think that's a cop out myself 
um hum 
um hum 
um hum 
um hum 
i wish i knew the answer uh 
but 
the reality you know uh 
i just feel sorry for the the people  that not only feel that they have to do that 
but 
and also for the people that 
are involved in it on the other those victims and everything and their parents and everything 
the only one i really had a 
i was really upset with uh was the columbine deal 
and that was because uh 
the one kid 
was making bombs and stuff like that in the basement and the parents  nothing about or or they did they didn't even think anything about and i don't think that behavior 
it's uh appropriate for a 
sixteen seventeen year old kid 
um 
yeah 
um hum 
and but you know that there and goes back to uh 
you know the quality or the quantity i mean if 
obviously this 
poor kid you know apparently 
was so miserable in his life that he was going down the stairs in basement to 
you know 
to 
figure out some way of uh 
reaching his 
nirvana or whatever you know and uh 
then his parents didn't have a clue 
or if they did they didn't care you know 
um hum 
um hum 
hum um 
um hum 
hum um 
well 
nowadays 
i grew up my dad hunted and everything you know so we had always had uh 
guns in the house and everything you know but uh 
you know i wouldn't 
no more 
go 
near one unless he was around because i uh 
i was told not to you know 
uh 
and 
they they always used to say you know if you if you stop letting 
uh normal people get a gun and the criminals will always have a gun well obviously that's not true you know 
uh 
my personal belief is that we have the right to bear arms 
uh 
if you're of a legal age and everything i'm not really sure the background checks 
really do that great of a job 
um hum 
how they going to how are they going to judge 
how they going to 
uh 
make sure the lock is on a gun i mean 
that just seems like a waste of money to me 
all you're doing is  letting a 
a company 
sell a a trigger lock 
for a gun 
or and make it make the guy make somebody have to buy one 
but you're not going make you put it on the gun so 
just seems like a waste of 
legislation 
money 
um hum 
um hum 
um hum 
well   
definitely this happened to me when i was in the 
third grade uh a friend of uh two of our friends were uh 
uh 
went home after school we were playing with a gun and everything and one uh one of them shot and killed the other one you know accidentally 
uh 
it just goes to 
you know my dad always had a gun he  didn't have it locked up all the time but you know wasn't necessarily in the same place all the time either you know i mean so 
if you weren't really looking for it 
and you know ah you  to  
just 
happenstance on to it or something you know uh 
uh 
i believe nowadays you know that 
perhaps with the uh with the 
the guns 
you know the availability being more people having guns that don't know don't 
shouldn't have them 
apparently 
uh 
you know they should be uh 
under lock and key 
uh 
and as for the 
you know the parents 
somebody's responsible for you know 
but see then you get in to catch twenty two because of the legislation i mean you can't require 
i don't see how you can require a 
uh 
a guy who buys a gun to buy a a lock and then buy a safe for the 
for the gun and and and do all that stuff because that 
in the case of a burglar comes into your house 
which is why 
why you have a 
gun anyway you have some fear of something like that happening otherwise you shouldn't have one unless you're a sportsman 
and uh 
then you know you're 
it's not gonna be worth it to have the gun in the first place so 
uh 
i do believe that in some the cases 
uh  
the parents or the uh 
responsible adult 
should be uh 
found guilty of that 
um hum 
um hum 
right 
um 
well 
that's a 
that's a tough one 
uh 
i remember when you know when we were we had you know 
some movies like that but they were like the bowery boys and stuff you know or 
it was 
you pretty much knew it was all fake anyway you know but 
and to me that's fake 
and uh uh 
and i never really thought about when was growing up that it was 
what was real and everything uh i always knew that 
by i there again know by my dad being a hunter and everything you know i knew that when you shot something that it died it wasn't a it wasn't a game you know 
uh 
and 
i'd hate to 
think that that would 
cause some kid to go off his rocker and shoot somebody out  shoot another human being i mean that doesn't 
i don't even know why there should be any concern for it guess is what i'm saying 
no  
we uh 
i generally tried to keep her childhood her childhood you know 
there's a time to grow up and there's time to be a child and and uh 
we divorced when she was eight years old so 
i would get up every saturday morning and watch cartoons with her and stuff like that you know 
and 
tried not to let her watch some of the ones that i 
that i didn't like you know so 
and then on movies and stuff uh 
we'd let her see some 
shoot them up movies and everything but 
the the weirdest movie she's seen uh 
was e t 
i remember that i mean 

her and her mother went and seen it and everything we were 
divorced at the time and uh 
then i went and bought the movie 
and 
and brought her over to my house on the weekend and everything and 
showed her the movie and 
i said this is e t we're going to watch 
e t she goes all right you know we was eating pizza you know and 
and put it on and then when he  
she starts bawling and everything and i'm going 
well what's the matter and she goes 
well he's going to die i said no he ain't you've seen the movie 
but you know it wasn't 
to her 
the way i 
took it was that you know 
it wasn't the same it 
it was just wasn't the same movie so 
and in this one he could die so 
um hum 
um 
um hum 
no there's a lot of people go to church that aren't worth anything too you know so i don't really believe that  
going to church you know uh 
uh  
makes you a better human being than another human being 
i believe that the you know your 
i believe that most people with basic 
uh 
structure in life if it's 
based similar to the bible 
or you could say buddhism or whatever you know uh 
uh 
that you will tend to have a better 
than you will if you 
non 
quote unquote religious  
religious ways 
but i don't believe somebody going to church makes them a better human being than the next person 
uh 
a lot of 
hypocrites that go to church 
now these kids i 
i think more just more than anything else i mean 
one thing i  
i remember hearing it a lot about too was they  they were picked on 
i mean 
come 
who wasn't picked on you know 
i mean just because you're i mean i wasn't really a 
an athletic i did  play uh 
sports when i was in in high school but i  
damn sure wasn't any good you know 
like 
other guys but 
whether i did or whether i didn't you know i 
i don't 
i don't 
nobody picked on me 
i mean one time i got into it  
with one of the uh 
centers in football you know big old guy 
and then uh 
and i 
still about the same size but 
oh he said he's going to 
kick my you know what and everything i said well be outside you know 
no he 
he didn't even come  i mean he came out but 
it's like he went the other way i thought well you know he 
you take it if he'd 
get a big kick out of kicking my skinny little butt you know then 
but you know 
and years ago it was kind of funny we'd seen him uh seen each other and everything and uh 
and 
at the 
someplace around and he sit there and went 
hey remember that time i said yeah yeah yeah 
he says i didn't 
he said i didn't think you'd stand up to me i said well you know what the heck 
you know 
only thing you could do is 
beat my rear end you know so 
i think there's a heck of a lot more to it then what we will probably ever know um 
you know  they really haven't checked into the background of the parents you know they're still  
what their beliefs were and everything 
uh 
and i think that's a shame because you know you mentioned it 
about 
something accidentally  
where uh 
some kid shoots another kid you know and then the parents are 
are responsible 
it and everything you know these two kids 
went in 
to kill 
and they wanted to kill more than what they killed 
uh 
then they killed  so we will never know 
their endpoint why they did it 
but 
i think there's got to be something 
that we could 
out 
you know uh 
from their parents as to how they lived you know they could have been 
anything you know 
they could have been down there they could have been 
making him making him do it you know 
uh uh 
i just think it's a different time now i don't think i think everybody's 
living more 
today 
and talking about the future you know 
hoping that the future's  
i think there's a 
quote unquote uh 
in time aspect to life you know 
everybody's living longer everybody's uh there's more medical things where people get uh 
can  be healed 
things that they couldn't be healed 
uh 
so everybody today is living 
uh 
basically as today as their 
where back thirty years ago i mean when i was a kid you know i mean 
i wasn't really thinking about today i mean i was thinking about 
tomorrow 
getting married having kids you know and having a 
nice place to live 
um hum 
yeah and then you know then 
i will show that son of a gun you know i will 
i will shoot him you know 
uh 
like you know the guys that were 
picking on him i don't even know whether they even shot him then but 
um 
but yeah i think they kind of just thought you know  
i will 
you know i will 
i will 
to them that 
you know they can't push me around 
and  uh they didn't really 
anything except for that they that 
death is 
um hum 
she graduated last year 
so uh 
but 
she went to 
she went  she was on home study 
so 
um hum 
um hum 
no she did uh she  
my ex wife did uh 
i would've 
her 
to get continue going to school but 
she had some problems with some students and stuff 
um 
right 
she just went there last year 
she had a uh 
she 
taught a  by a tutor 
from 
she 
from kirkisville that's 
she graduated 
which is a suburb of saint louis 
um um 
um generally it's in the summertime uh 
that's the way it was when she was going to school 
uh 
now you know with her going to school at like at like at uh saint louis 
um 
i guess it would be that way 
but we really ever  
really haven't talked about that but my ex wife's got family here 
so uh 
you know she comes in about two or three 
weeks at least out of a summer 
and i tend to see her then 
um hum 
oh yeah 
i uh 
i think she really kind of knows that from conversations uh with me and 
while she was growing 
uh 
you know mine uh my values and stuff 
basically are uh more religious oriented 
you know 
uh 
than i would say 
my wife's 
but uh 
uh 
so i think she kinda she knows 
what i value as being important what i value as 
being not important and 
but 
on it the rest of the question  i'd 
i'd love to have been able to have uh 
uh been  
every other weekend sounds good you know as far as a 
um 
i would say see in mine i don't think they really were because i can't really say for anybody else's uh but 
but 
we would 
we had  
we had intended on having a uh 
we got divorced in eighty eight and we had intended but then the next couple three years of having joint custody 
but then 
our divorce was 
somewhat bitter 
or became even more bitter and everything you know 
um 
so 
that tended not to 
not to happen 
and then she ended up getting transferred to 
to saint louis from here 
so 
it  something that  really  
wouldn't have wouldn't have been able to 
happen when she moved out there and that was in ninety so 
um hum 
right 

mmhmm 
well i'm 
now i'm i can only speak for my relationship now my dad was uh 
out of town quite a bit when we were growing up so uh 
from a maternal 
aspect you know 
mom was there all the time 
and uh 
and a lot of times 
the male and the female the  
mother and the father role 
you know as far 
punishment and everything like that 
but uh 
uh 
it 
would 
i 
i know in my 
it would've been a lot better i think for 
for  and everything you know i mean for  you know 
we would've been able to 
uh 
joint 
you know when 
growing up 
a 
well by her being out there i mean you know you can just imagine she's 
you know 
and being a girl not saying  anything bad about 
being my daughter you know 
worrying about 
things in school and 
weekends and 
like that 
so 
i 
worry so much about it so 
um 
well i know uh 
something like that 
uh 
in the 
range you 
mom 
um 
threatening her and 
like that 
and uh 
her all i'd 
is get on the 
and 
there and 
you know 
i can 
out there in 
hours you know 
so 
i don't know 
problem 
you need to get 
either talk to me 
it talk to your mom about it or go see somebody else and talk to them about it 
but you know you need to get it out of your 
chest 
and a lot 
bitterness of the 
she did 
a 
uh 
a  
like a 
or something and it and it 
kinda the cause 
um hum 
to 
i had a 
about it said you know you didn't cause anything you know me and your mother caused it all 
anything you 
spot of the 
marriage so 
and that's where you got to look at 
when you see that 
in the mirror remember that you know 
um hum 
um hum 
then she'd blow up on me too you know 
a couple three times 
and then  
sit there and say well you go ahead and you know you can 
me every name in the book do whatever the heck you want to but 
i'm 
you can't take that away 
me 
so 
well you know 
like you said i think they just 
go 
a lot of 
i mean i had a lot of uh 
my dad for  
things that happened you know um 
perhaps not being there when i was 
you know younger and 
like that 
and uh 
anything me and my brother got 
of it you know 
he's three 
older than me 
and then uh 
but 
but 
you know 
you know i don't have they 
they're 
my 
away but uh 
you know i don't 
any 
them at all you know 
kinda like 
kind of like a 
up thing i i guess you know i mean you 
you 
kinda 
there and say yeah  
you you know you did 
you could you know i mean 
um hum 
then you 
it or you don't and i mean 
um hum 
because he's like 
he was like 
some 
old when i 
born so 
the 
thing 
wanted 
another kid 
um hum 
um hum 
um hum 
um hum 
of them are all the above 
um hum 
and uh 
some of them aren't 
quite a few of them that 
uh 
when they came home 
i think when uh 
that 
there 
any  
and  you know 
like you came 
got 
the plane and 
you know 
you know 
um hum 
um hum 
um 
well i i got one 
that that 
meets all the criteria 
and 
and uh 
on the 
you know and uh 
and he 
he 
me to take him and get him 
and everything but you know i keep saying  you know you're the one who's got to 
man 
you know 
you got to 
up the 
you know 
and uh 
and he's like 
and uh 
him down here every now and then 
you know he 
drinks all the time to try to 
ease the 
and the 
really should have been 
done gone by 
as he 
in his 
you know 
so 
i think there's a lot of 
can 
an excuse you know 

um hum 
i don't really work with them all i basically do is i know a lot of people and everything and they  tend to come in there for help and you know and i just kinda help out with the uh 
some of the work that 
be done 
talk to them or whatever you know 
uh 
i tell 
they can go there 
it's the v v a vietnam veteran's association some people don't even know about it you know 
a lot of them they don't want any better they won't want anything different that's all they want 
i think that basically that's in a nut shell they've reached a point in their life where 
you know that they're cowards as far as going out and killing themselves but they want to kill themselves slowly by drinking themselves to death or 
um 
smoking you know whatever you know smoking uh  crack or whatever and uh 
then just living 
in a hell i mean 
basically because you know 
the open shelter i don't know whether you ever been around there but it 
it isn't a pretty sight you know 
i'd say of uh 
i think they the the v v a in generally sees on the average 
five seven ten something like that a day 
and not all of them homeless 
and not all of them are 
are vietnam vets either you know 
uh 
but you know they tend to say i'd say of those there's about three 
three to four of them that are vietnam veterans 
uh a day 
and they tend to 
come back i mean i  
originally started going in there just drinking coffee you know to kill time and everything you know 
and uh 
now i kinda know everybody you know and 
somebody will walk in and i will say hey how's it going you know 
and they will talk 
then there's 
i there's another thing to   
about 
a lot of the uh 
people back 
uh vietnam  and everything that the 
they will tend to talk to maybe you or talk to somebody else 
and uh a like an authoritative figure and not believe a damn word they say 
right 
right 
um hum 
well they go to the clinic sometimes and uh 
clinic's basically a pill popping place you know here 
take these you will feel better you know 
then they they really don't get any 
satisfaction for what ails them you know that side of a 
you know you tell you you tell them you can't drink but yet you give them a pill that will give them the same effect you know 
whose 
um hum um hum 
um hum 
um hum 
um hum 
um 
pick up bodies 
um hum 
um hum 
um hum 
um hum 
um hum 
well i know people that will sleep outside and uh 
not all of them are veterans and everything but they there again they don't want to be a part of the quote unquote 
sheltered 
system you know 
uh 
staying at an open shelter v o a or something like that 
i think it's just 
if they're vietnam vets i think it's 
the authority thing you know well you lied to me once you lied to me 
four hundred times since then you know you 
probably going to lie to me again you know and uh 
then a lot of them i don't think are capable 
while in their present condition i know like  the friend of mine i'm talking about 
there's no way in hell that he could hold down a job 
right now 
but i knew him when he was eight ten months 
sober 
and he worked every day 
but just something happened why he got 
him and his girlfriend broke up 
and that was like 
around christmas time 
and i ran into him like february or something like that 
and ever since february its 
he's been 
sitting on a bench getting drunk everyday 
and i sit there and go you know 
i tell people 
the 
v a clinic and everything and they got a homeless 
thing uh over there i say you know 
this guy friend i know you know he's a vietnam vet 
you guys need to get out there and help him you know 
i mean you're in more of a uh 
situation than i am to be able to go out and and and sit there and 
but he wants me to take him like mary haven or something like that 
and he's been there before and all he does is stay till he sobers up and goes back out 
um hum 
um hum 
pot's never been uh 
never been 
associated with any kind of a crime that were some a violent crime of any 
um hum 
um hum 
turn the turn the music up and it's already blasting you know uh 
um hum 
okay 

okay 
uhhum 
uh this is my senior year i'm graduating in june 
i'm a spanish major 
i had psychology class i had one 
that counts for anything 
like you know studies 
little 
yeah 
i had i had fun i enjoyed it's one my my favorite classes actually 
for for an elective 
uh it was 
uh professor  
uh it was it's it was interesting i mean it's it's it's lot it's lots to remember a lot of terminology but i enjoyed it

just a little uh 
east of here in  high school

that's okay 
there 
what'd you do in australia 
were you really 
that's awesome 
wow but you taught psychology 
oh wow how'd you hook up with that oh you just you just happened 
just a job 
that's an awesome job 
oh my gosh 
that awesome there's there's a lot of stuff to do down there 
if you like outdoors 
i bet 
i'm 
to come back to this weather i would do 
i would 
is there really 
i've seen the um big amphitheater and with that uh the 
what is that 
the opera house yeah right right on the right on there was the ocean or whatever it's gorgeous 
ah 
i can't i can't believe 
oh 
oh that's why okay 
is there really 
they're more laid back 
uhhum 
they're like the 
are they all like the people on crocodile dundee where they just 
no they just like 
okay 
oh is that right 
they're kind of like more isolated here and parochial 
is that right 
it's got more cosmopolitan 
because heck you know it's a it's sydney 
it's is uh that's like a that's like a tourist place 
is that right 
oh okay 
because they got beaches and and 
yeah 
i would hurt 
uhhum 
is that right 
they got 
they got all that white sand and 
uh uh you know that that water can see 
down for miles and 
uh 
yeah it's probably not as you know 
like you know 
as uh 
condensed and 
packed as like most tourist areas because 
like in australia's a little out of the way yes you know 
you know spend some time to get there as ya like you like you would florida california so it's like if you wanna go to the beach you don't always say oh 
like memorial day it's like forget it 
you know just forget it 
it's like but with australia at least you don't have to worry about you know 
fighting the tourists 
is that right 
well a lot of all the places got these like little well known hiding spots you know like 
try to keep them like a a like a  a secret away from the tourists 
before they 
you know overrun the place 
once the tourists hear about it you know 
it's like you know 
it's like you know like some of these places in florida 
kind like ruined by tourists you know like fort lauderdale 
daytona 
yeah it's like after after the kids get done 
you know forget it it's like i because um 
i used to 
when i was in 
in um 
like a freshman 
um i heard 
i heard like don't even go to florida because like they they do not want students 
but they don't like they don't like your they don't like you know the the trash and and the whatnot that they bring 
yeah exactly so they so i 
i said well if you know i went to i went to uh padre island 
i didn't want to pick it and you know 
it's in texas 
so 
it's out on the gulf is that that's a nice beach but 
that probably would compare to yours in australia 
gosh 
oh in the city 
um 
oh that was probably 
awesome 
i haven't either i never knew that they had so many beaches i mean i know that had a good reputation 
you know for for like just just just you know just having a great vacation time because nobody ever came back was ready to tell oh yeah this place was terrible you know the weather was bad 
you know that people were 
people were rude everybody there they would say so 
ah you gotta go you gotta go yes it 
you know it's a long flight but it's well worth the time 
what the hell am i doing here 
is that right 
i just i just love i love i just love those koala bears 
just to see a koala bear i'd go 
you know there just like little teddy bears bring them bring them 
bring one home to your daughter say here is a little playbabies here's your  here's your  here's a baby brother for you 
really 
do they 
ah they look so sweet and cuddly you know just like 
just like something you just want to take home 
really 
what do they eat 
that's it 
ah 
uhhuh 
is that right 
oh my gosh 
it's a wonder they're not like you know falling out of trees 
that's why they have such sharp sharp claws i guess so they can lock in 
you mean one of those you had 
one of those hit your head that would hurt 
kamikaze koalas 
so is that like is that like in the parks you know like you know we like grand canyon you know you can feed them 
you know you know like 
junk food and mcdonalds 
is that right 
big ball of fur do they have like little babies they carry in their pouches like kangaroos 
ah isn't that cute 
like a little papoose 
you had to go to a zoo actually 
okay 
i thought they'd just be out walking around you know 
oh really 
cute 
oh that's right i forgot you guys have like a big kangaroo 
population 
you know like ohio has like you know all these deer and stuff so it's like they have 
do guys like 
like shoot them have like kangaroo season 
okay that's kind of 
the tail 
okay 
really 
so do kangaroos actually bounce 
or is that just you know 
oh 
they do really okay 
really 
are they friendlier other than than the koalas 
yeah can you go up and like feed them and 
uhhum 
do you have like any friendly animals whatsoever in  in australia you know like we have we have bears in in in america it's like it's like well if they if they see 

got bears 
uh okay 
uhhum 
that's because it's kind of like warm and tropical that's why they like it down there 
especially why you know we try at  at five in the morning 
oh the white ones 
okay 
oh yeah the the 
like pigeons 
okay 
but 
they don't have any like endangered  they're not like on an endangered species list where you can't like 
really 
okay 
so if you if you you can't you couldn't bring any any like pet's back say if you had a dog could you bring it back to the states so you have to leave all those 
uhhum 
they don't have rabies 
oh so there's so that's like that's 
uhhuh 
that's mean 
that's why nobody brings it 
yeah but it's their stupid laws 
yeah 
there's i i 
uhhuh 
it would spread 
okay 
that's true 
you're like 
like hell no i'm not 
damn 
you know for a cat 
you're like honey it's just a cat 
you know it's my baby 
you 
you can go home and visit it any time i'm not paying you know uh 
nope 
oh right 
and you know that they're your parents they're not gonna say they're not gonna say no to you anyways 
now they are 
well that's a that's a that's a that's just she probably thinks oh they're they will like her grandkids so that 
that's 
that's her job is to spoil them 
so the poor things have like you know they have the belly hanging on the ground 
um 
i 
i i when i was growing up i had i had a whole 
litter of cats 
so 
they and they and they 
they they can tend to they will they will eat all day 
cats 
yeah 
you just you just you just 
that these just you just put put a bowl of  kitten chow 
yeah that's all that that's that that's that's their life you know 
it was 
it was  especially it was my job but 
as you know the parents always get stuck 
i have a brother 
he's uh he he 
actually he he graduated with a 
accounting degree 
yeah 
um he's still in columbus 
he's uh he's like a he's like 
some sort of 
in 
some sort of business i don't understand business whatsoever 
yeah that's all i know 
i i it's  it's lost on me 
so 
i'm sorry i'm not i don't have that i don't have a finance head so 
what does your wife do 
just 
that's a full time job 
oh really 
that's cool 
the government's always good for money 
oh okay 
oh okay i thought well what you know because like some 
okay so  
they 
she's like an independent contractor for them 
okay 
that's a good job i mean because you can get flex time 
yeah it was 
yeah 
it's like you know yeah like a hundred 
hours you wouldn't no in one week oh man 
uh just 
travel 
to australia maybe yeah it's a 
that's a 
just for a few months you know like you know like you hear like everybody's stories do you ever go to europe 
did you do 
say like you ever do that the backpacking 
bit 
did you 
yeah i 
so that's what i want to do just yeah 
exactly 
sydney yeah 
germany spain 
can you really 
uh or a student or is it a student visa or is 
as a tourist visa 
okay 
so will you be 
like a waitress or 
or uh 
uh 
clerical 
okay 
is that right 
so like 
there's like a is there like a large american population say well i think i uh want just 
you know to like you know yeah it's like cosmopolitan but sometimes you wanna just wanna hang out with your with your own 
so is you know do you have is there any problems just finding you know people from the states 
okay 
are they 
but they all look alike 
so if you're not wearing the nikes 
is that right 
uhhum 
like stay the heck out of my way here i come 
it's my world and welcome to it 
that they don't wear like the loud hawaiian shirts and and you know the shorts and the cameras that the they 
do they 
oh the japanese come too 
really 
why 
just because it's close to japan 
uhhum 
okay 
so they get more  buying power if they go there okay 
just like 
no 
yeah 
oh really 
so they spend all these thousands of dollars on 
airfare 
and 
they're still 
they're still coming out ahead 
man they should get just one of those las vegas chapel weddings 
it's usually the like a drive through 
if you know if they really wanna do it do it on the cheap 
you know i and they have like elvis as your as a as a 
perform the  ceremony 
that's crazy 
is that where you got married 
a little less romantic 
is it like a honeymoon destination too 
like the caribbean 
jamaica 
okay that's why they do a lot a lot of like biological studies is 
barrier 
okay 
i've heard of it 
is 
is that why people go snorkeling 
oh really 

so it's just like 
it's totally like you know 
unruined by tourists and it's not it's not like overrun like you know like it gets like a lot of these 
you know like like whole 
down in florida you get like all the 
almost 
it of like heard all the major cities are just like barrier okay the is 
studies you know strip biological malls and all 
that like a it's lot like lot do they do have they why like that's 
okay 
any of those 
like you know 
uhhum jamaica 
caribbean the like 
too destination honeymoon a like 
it is 
that's cool 
that's that's the best places where you have to actually work to get there 
but sydney is like 
is 
is like pretty much accessible because 
okay so people can like fly in do do their do their little wedding thing fly out 
wow 
i can't i can't believe it of all  i i you know i thought i just that just blows my mind you can spend all thousands of dollars to have it just for a wedding 
that's true 
i'm sure i'm sure i'm sure i will show you you know welcomes all those dollars but 
did they have like little like a like a like a 
wedding industry 
it's like 
uhhuh 
wow 
they wear those kimonos or they wear like a like a is it like a  wear a what 
is it 
okay 
okay 
they said uh they they said it's pretty much uh regular like 
just a have them 
western where they wedding where they throw the rice and 
okay 
i thought maybe you would 
like crash one of the the weddings 
say i'm a i'm a i'm a i'm a professor i'm doing studies here as a 
what did you spend most of your time doing besides snorkeling 
really 
take a lot of time 
did you teach at university level 
really 
you like the university level 
do they have like these big lecture halls over there too 
oh do they really 
i thought that was just something like maybe 
unique unique to the states 
wow that's intimidating 
you walk in 
and i'm like you're like oh my gosh 
so it's 
oh you know the fire on that huh 
i so they got baptism by fires is 
that like 
cause you you survived okay because you're here 
you're still teaching 
is that right 
uhhum 
did you guys 
thing you know it's just you know how to 
you have all these people and you gotta keep their attention for like an hour or two 
oh is that right 
which reminds me 
it's like your  your 
your eighteen year old 
eighteen month old daughter you know you got to you know like 
amuse them 
you know and and so like distract them 
really 
what did he tell you 
throw nerf balls in the audience and 
wow 
i don't know i that's like 
that's that's a 
that's a 
you know that's i guess that's one way to you know to to get you into the 
into you know 
into the business but 
i  
i don't know 
i don't know how do you prepare yourself to teaching in front of a large audience that's like something you'd have to like 
you know 
i would have to anyways you get ease myself into 
oh 
i don't know do it and incrementally like you know like you're like 
like 
do 
like 
like hear a recitation then we will then like kind of like work your way up 
you had done 
okay so it's this was like totally okay 
you know 
welcome to australia you know 
you know here's your here's your here's your text book you know go to work 
so how many years did you actually 
were there teaching 
three years 
wow 
man and you're loving it too 
at least at least you're trying to convince yourself of it you're not  
like 
you're warming up 
oh well 
is that right 
oh is that right 
oh san  well did you spend much time or were you just passing through 
the airport in san francisco 
really 
what are they like 
it's san  is 
is it kind of like like a like a like 
i think is it it is a pretty much a ritzy place 
okay 
okay 
uh okay 
it's is that silicon valley 
okay 
just is it like a  kind of snobbish 
or are they a 
damn what a problem 
then would you would you that you would 
don't you wish you had those kind of problems huh 
oh my gosh 
you 
you 
you 
you be sleeping on the beach before you shell out that kind of bucks 
uhhum 
man i heard housing is tight out there but that's crazy 
you like like the people 
japan do like they're cheaper flying in than than than doing it at at home 
my gosh 
did you say that's what traveling does it makes you appreciate what you got 
makes you realize all the things you do have and 
makes you feel like wow 
like 
actually pretty much know where that's why i want that's why i want a book 
exactly 
not too much now just studying 
you know like you know like you realize it it it 
teaching studying takes up a lot of time 
uh no that's why i wanna do the hiking things i'm like ready i can get a like a visa 
because i somebody told me wow you know you go some some places in europe you might have some problems getting a tourist visa 
because sometimes they work illegal 
did you really 
what'd you do 
oh okay 
oh okay so 

yeah 
yeah 
so the  
what are the  
are they high or 
oh oh really 
really 
so is it is that so like they the the economy's 
good right now well right now 
uh 
shaky 
okay 
not too many dot coms apparently over there 
banking 
okay 
really okay 
i didn't know 
i didn't know there was like a 
effect for australia i thought you know 
being separate meant 
you know 
i know it's connected to like you know 
england 
because it's like i guess that's 
i guess uh i  maybe like england owned it once 
so that 
really 
i know i 
it's a site that isn't that 
so it's like same deal with canada you know like how it used to be owned by 
okay 
but it's like they it's like a democracy over there  
in australia they you know it's not they don't have like a king and queen and 
okay 
okay she wouldn't come in and say well off with your  
yeah 
oh is it really 
have you been there 
oh yeah 
i  
i  i i know there's like 
some lot of people says well you can even go to vietnam now like 
why would  
yeah 
it's like it's like yeah you know you can go 
you can go now to cuba but why would you it's like it's 
it's just 
uhhum 
be like going back in time 
so if you so you know like modern conveniences you know like toilets and the hot water  you know and 
oh really 
no 
they don't have like 
your your basic 
amenities 
oh my gosh 
really 
uhhum 
where's it at 
are they like 
at the at the aren't they like i thought those like 
aren't the hospitals supposed to be like dormitories or 
you know just you know their the 
they they just provide you basics but there supposed to be like at least you know 
i mean you get what you pay for 
okay 
uhhum 
like what 
uhhum 
okay 
oh 
but it's more the that was more the exception than the norm 
so where in europe did you go 
where would you where actually where would you 
not recommend going 
okay 
oh sure 
you can't go to europe 
really 
you just felt it was like just totally over 
overrated 
okay 
well at least you're honest about it you know 
uhhum 
is that right 
everything had grey poupon 
oh that's fantastic 
and all the wine you can drink 
a little out of the way backwards 
okay 
yeah 
did you do do the da da dat don't tell you do the tourist thing 
uhhum 
uhhum 
just always really rushed 
uhhum 
really 
why's that just because of the wall 
go 
go go visit a wall 
okay they when they took 
by the it was i think i remember that when they when they took that on the wall brandenberg gates or something like that 
okay i remember hearing that 
uhhum 
say hi 
uhhum 
you're like 
no no he's back there trying to shoot me or  
because i 
i remember hearing horror stories you know about people just dying 
you know left and right just like you know just dropping 
just to get out of uh out of out of east germany 
you know and they don't play 
they will they 
they will they they will shoot they do shoot to kill 
just now just to just to walk back and forth is amazing 
oh 
uhhum 

uhhum 
the watch towers yeah 
you kind of like you know looking up and says 
you know is anybody's you know got there sights on me 
yeah 
it's because that's a it's like you know like you know that's like the world war two stuff you know there's like the remains of it sure but it's like you get to see the wall it's like  it i mean it's i'm sure there's like the there is uh the the what from what i understand there was like you know 
you know cosantiner wire and barbed wire and all those like a big big 
uh brick wall and whatever 
you can actually you know still see it unless they tore it down 
okay 
just like to peruse over the history of it 
okay 
wow 
so you actually 
it's like it's neat it's like because you were like a part of that history 
at least when you were over they you feel like wow i was it 
you know something to tell your daughter it's like i was there 
did you go to scotland 
see now and i'm like i'm like depressed 
because like 
well i guess  got 
few months here now i wanna just go you know it's like when you get psyched up 
uh 
i haven't decided 
heck i 
i because i heard like you know there's some people told me well you know if you wanna be like a 
you can there's you even like do uh teaching over there like teach english or you gonna be a nanny it's like so 
you know it's like if i  you know the right 
right right uh position opens up i will just 
i might not be 
be coming back any time soon 
really 
not not in australia they have it pretty good 
but 
are you talking about places like 
like in asia 
can you really 
wow 
okay 
and then they can then after that you know  the money runs out they come back and then start up teaching wow that's fantastic 
okay 
that's  that's a that's not 
uh nothing you don't really hafta have like like like you have to have like like you know like 
like a doctorate or any like sort of credentials whatsoever as long as you can 
you know talk the talk 
uhhum 
is that right 
really 
will they put you they won't put you in front of like a two hundred fifty 
person lecture hall will they 
that that'd be hard 
that'd be that'd be that'd would be a challenge 
uh i no 
i never i never looked into that but that's a good suggestion 
they yeah like like being the the they're gonna be like 
like spanish instructors no i  i never thought about that 
not until you just just uh 
just 
just said it so yeah or like teaching english as a second language i know they teach those classes here 
so 
i was thinking well you know maybe i should start looking into like teaching classes 
i was like well i didn't know if that was like true or not that you can actually teach around the world because i've heard 
i've heard stories you know yeah you can you can get they like people pay i'm like but why 
but but it's like yeah if you say it's true i will look into it 
because uh okay 
is it just like a regular job like forty hour week where where you be  
okay 
okay 
so you think just like one on one where you just like sit like uh like like us doing it or we it's like in a classroom setting just have like a um group conversation 
okay 
okay 
so there's definitely work  
available if you wanna you know pursue it 
uhhum 
you  did you visit spain while you were there because that's one of the places i wanna 
yeah i can't you you went to europe and you missed spain 
oh okay 
see that will be 
you can plan that as a second honeymoon if 
sure your wife wouldn't object 
sure honey i can i can do it 
i can fit it in 
i was easy major 
why'd you become a psych major 
oh okay 
yeah basically it is just great to get out 
yeah 
no 
honestly 
i enjoy i enjoy the psychology classes and i don't think i i don't think i could be a psych major it's just little 
little too a little too intimidating to me it's like lots of 
like all that freudian stuff it's just it's just i was uh it's just 
it's just wow it's this will blow my mind and so i said okay spanish looks good 
uh besides just a degree 
so i can just get out and go and travel 
like you say a lot of these companies 
lot these like you say well 
you know i don't i don't know what the requirements are for for some these jobs over in europe but it's like 
maybe it's like as long as you have uh any sort of like 
degree you know they will take you 
clerical whatever 
because i'm from columbus 
it's cheap 
yeah 
yeah it's 
um 
no i didn't live at home but it's like i didn't want to pay  out of state  
out of state residencies 
like like if i went to indiana okay i'd have to like pay year out of state tuition so 
yeah 
oh yeah i lived in the dorms and 
got got away from that thank god 
uh 
actually i live at uh 
riverwatch towers on lane avenue 
i don't know 
much nicer than the dorms 
no oh no it's like right across the street 
oh yeah 
i got i got like two roommates 
they're 
i highly recommend 
the roommate thing 
so it's 
oh yeah it's like i get i get this kind of like a hostle 
you know hostel 
is that how you say it okay hostel 
environment it's like you know always  get to know everybody it's pretty much an apartment 
on the whole 
you know floor 
you know you become friends with everybody real fast so 
i'm hoping that's same deal when i travel it's like it's easy to make friends and hook up and you know say 
oh you got a job you know it's like you know hook me up 

i'm hoping that will be the same experience 
as it is at ohio state 
snobs 
i'm from palo alta don't talk to me 
you know you're not 
you're not 
you're not worthy 
that's all right 
okay 
oh is that right 
so i'm not gonna get too much of an attitude from people 
okay 
i'm thinking 
who who back 
are pretty cool 
you know 
is that right 
especially if they're  
americans 
you have  
you know like you know  the 
uh 
typical american 
tourist 
really they they are the biggest assholes 
the  
they are  they are  the  
they are the the majority huh 
oh boy 
that that 
like kinda like speaks poorly about us huh 
uhhum 
yeah like you share your  
food you know or you  you share you know you got 
the 
you know like an extra blanket i would think you know hey you know 
you need some 
you need this or that 
oh is that right 
they're not just in you know seeing seeing the sights or seeing the 
well maybe they are but it's like that that's a as a as a 
as a 
you know 
as a secondary agenda 
their 
their main purpose is 
is that you know 
drink around the world 
oh boy 
well see that's because i don't think americans travel as much as 
as like the the europeans do i think i guess 
because 
they have like 
i guess public transportation accessible they got the trains that  the eurotrains and the buses and 
and 
and 
and just like the  by just by personal car you can go 
you know 
across 
just go across the border you can then go and visit uh 
you know 
countries like 
like it's so condensed but here it's like we've got 
our oceans and 
it's like 
we gotta like fly 
so 
so i 
i think that's why like i think the europeans are more 
are much more cooler in that respect rather than much more cosmopolitan 
just because it they they they 
it's like it's no big deal for for like somebody in europe to speak like seven languages 
where here it's like you know you get somebody over here  who who can actually 
who actually knows english 
you know 
it's like so that that's 
i think that's 
i think that's what i will find 
hopefully 
hopefully 
you 
you can't isolate yourself from them 
uh 
it's like americans 
americans don't have a have a 
have a stronghold on it 
because i heard like 
i had never been here there 
i heard like new york don't even don't even 
ask a stranger because they won't even talk to you they won't look at you 
like on 
new york city it's like 
they 
they will okay 
have you ever been there 
oh you have 
it's like it's like 
man i well after i heard that i said  that's not even worth going if if they're gonna be rude 
do you really 
but it's a lot 
would you say it's a 
uh say it's a nice place to visit but you wouldn't wanna live there or would you actually live there 
really 
what did you do just like do the tourist thing like visit all those 
have you really have you gone to seen all the shows and 
no 
are they really 
wow i thought 
i thought they'd give you like at least student rates  
you know 
graduate student rates 
whatever 
you know like the wexner center 
but to go see something like cats or rent they'd still 
charge you out the 
really 
okay 
i didn't realize that 
really 
you know what's half of a million dollars that's still out of out of our out of our range 
oh my gosh 
they don't have any of these like  
student matinee specials where you can go in for like a buck fifty huh 
oh wow 
that makes it hard like if you got like a 
if like you and you got a family 
you know 
you know you take you 
if you wanted 
you wanted to like spend the night on the town with your 
you know with your family man that's 
that kinda like blows your whole budget for the year 
wow 
wow 
so is you 
pretty much have to be you know can't be middle class in new york have to  have to be 
rich or you're not 
uhhum 
uhhuh 
like not go out 
your t v is your entertainment for the year 
like  like what's the  you if you had time but if you had time and money and 
well you 
you'd be able to 
you know 
do the do the tourists things 
oh they do 
like what 
then you could go visit what the empire is that the big thing like the statue of liberty 
do you really 
somebody said you could like 
walk up there's like some sort of staircase and you can actually walk up to 
head if you really if you really wanted to go up 
and walk up through 
through her head you can do that 
is that right 
that's it 
i think i remember like if they were like 
remodeling a few years back is that right 
okay 
yeah i go to class 
okay 
i 

no big deal 
i'm comfortable 
i'm from columbus ohio i was born and raised in columbus uh 
i grew up on the east side of columbus  
graduated from  high school 
i 
then 
started working for ohio state in nineteen seventy seven and have been there here for twenty four years 
um my family personally my parents uh 
my parents 
my father was born and raised in daytona beach my mother was born and raised in uh 
portsmouth ohio both of them are ohio state graduates my father was a c p a 
my mother was a school teacher but didn't work 
at 
when we were kids 
actually they met at lazarus working 
at lazarus 
yeah they both 
were different 
you know he was in 
oh yep 
they both worked during college 
i guess my dad was on the 
g i bill after the war so that's how he got in here 
had to work some part time work to 
get his degree 
uhhum 
it's just east broad street just 
franklin park conservatory 
um no actually now i live in hilliard 
and i have a wife 
been married thirteen years have two kids age five and seven 
both of them ones in second grade and the other ones 
still in daycare at ohio state university 
uhhum mobile 
it is it's a lot of work it really is 
she's a a nurse and she works at the  medical center 
in the breast cancer department 
she's a 
o r nurse 
she's worked here for twenty two years also got her degree at ohio state 
she grew up in dayton and then moved here to go to college and 
then stayed uh at ohio state after college 
we met at ohio state 
um yeah everything revolves around ohio state huh 
i worked when i first started working here i was working as an 
orderly in the operating room for ten years and she worked in the intensive care unit so 
only been in the maintenance area for maybe ten 
years also 
um i don't know it just 
i don't know it didn't seem like it was heading anywhere and i wanted to start doing something that was more career oriented now i do 
h a h v a c for 
twenty two buildings in the northeast area 
do a lot of 
chillers and 
laser labs and chill water for uh 
different kinds of experiments they're doing in the chemistry departments and stuff like that so 
went to school 
through our 
technical school 
for it to get a degree in the 
uh h v a c stuff 
oh yeah i like it's everyday is different you have different problems everyday you know and 
i like 
working with tools and fixing stuff so 
that's uh come in handy but 
yeah from the 
yeah 
um actually a lot of our stuff did pretty well while we were off so didn't make you feel as needed as you wanted to be maybe 
you know 
yeah you know 
we got a lot of our buildings up and running before they went 
on strike and i think 
the bosses 
knew this was coming so 
a lot of the air conditioning was already running by then 
right yeah the middle of may is when they usually start most of this stuff 
heating cooling and ventilation 
uhhum 
um all of them the university is divided up in different areas 
and there's a shop within each area that takes care of all the maintenance needs for those areas usually 
there are about twenty buildings or so ours is 
in the northeast area 
from wexner down through the oval to 
oh i don't know about 
uh 
derby or so around in there and then on over to woodruff 
nope 
not my  
not my area if it's hot in here 
you better call the north shop 
uhhum 
because yeah 
yeah 
well that's probably the roof right there so 
there was snow or something 
i will bet 
yep 
hm 
control problems 
of course there's always a leak somewhere 
yeah 
well it could be hot water they 
send out heat and hot water to all the different buildings from the power plant 
but about now they drain that 
it's drained for the summer to give us an opportunity to work on leaks and stuff so 
they might have drained it and that's why it quit 
hm yeah 
run quick 
put plastic 
oh i don't know it seemed like 
it's a tough call because it's very unusual situation here at ohio state where they have a union and they have so many different skills in a union you think of unions you think of autoworkers you think of pipefitters you think of you don't think of such a wide variety of people 
and that's very hard to negotiate for anybody you know when you're talking raises and lots of money like this which what they were going for 
and the majority of the people in the skilled trades 
aren't real big participaters in the union you know we just ride along and from what i've seen over the twenty years i've been here 
is it seemed that 
a lot of the union 
what they did was was keep 
the trouble maker employees around longer you know 
and 
so we've really never had a lot of use for the union but 
recently we just figured out that you 
if they decide to strike we have no choice too and 
you can't work because they will take all the money you make 
crossing that lines so 
you cannot work anybody that came back to work will lose all the money that they made they will take them to court 
and they will 
yeah 
it's against 
yeah it's against the union contracts so 
you have just 
no no they take no they take the money whether you're in it or not you have no choice you have a choice as to whether you're a member or not but they still take the money 
and if you cross the line they will take that money back 
so anybody that 
yeah you know you're better off getting another job if it lasts for a long time 
i did some of that 
it's tough to you know columbus has a big 
you know 
job market there's everywhere you look there's help wanted so but it's tough to get a job where you can just walk in and start today or you know tell him hey you know the minute strike is over i'm gone and 
so that was kind of tough looking for that type of job so 
oh yeah three weeks of pay it's 
cost yeah cost quite a bit of money but 
if you got some 
strike pay and this and that but it wasn't a lot you know two hundred dollars a week isn't much at all so 
and when you have a 
and 
i mean two hundred dollars a week don't pay my day care bill so ah 
so it's gonna be tight for our family for 
a few months you know to get back on 
no 
no 
i mean 
the money 
you know the money is great you know fine it's the biggest raise they've ever given anybody here at the university 
and 
actually the deal that they offered the sunday before they went out on strike 
was a better deal than what they've really settled for now as far as because the signing bonus was more and 
the big stipulation was the fact that these people didn't wanna be separated from the hospital 
they don't think it's fair you know that 
you start down at the hospital as a janitor or whatever and you make this amount and if you came to main campus you would make seventy five cents more an hour automatic and 
then they did the raise and they wanted eighty cents at the hospital and a dollar on main campus and stuff so 
that's kind of a sticky situation because they've always kept the university 
and the hospital separate budget 
they are definitely a separate budget and you know the u 
hospital i can see where they're coming from everybody in the hospital business is struggling right now with the insurance problems and this and that 
and they're 
thirty five million in the hole because they bought o s u east and all this but 
you know it's not the unions fault that they 
ran out the contract you know and you know so 
and what we find in our area mainly is 
that 
people 
the 
entrance wage is so low that 
it's hard to find anybody that has any skills to come in and do the jobs that's you know and they want this place to be the top ten in the nation or whatever as far as but they're not willing to pay a lot of these people and 
you know they think contracting is the way but you're always gonna have to have people here to 
because 
contractors just don't drop what they're doing and show up today 
and a lot of times we have a job finished before they've written up the work order 

you know we're right there within moments if there's a flood or you know something like that you call the  i will be in thursday you know if your air condition so 
they're always gonna have to have people here so i just feel 
they're either better to downscale the amount of people they have and get highly qualified people 
than have twenty people that half of them know what's going on half of them don't so but that's tough to do when you're starting 
people at eight dollars an hour and stuff so 
there's you know wendy's 
there's places that you can make that money so 
uhhum 
my 
you know 
to me the thing that hurt me the most out of it is 
they wanna put caps 
on our salaries 
so i'm at the highest scale i can go 
right now as far as job title 
i there's no other job i can move to until unless i move in to 
supervision or some up in the 
and i will be out of the union if i do that anyways so 
but they're gonna put a cap on that 
where you can only make so much money 
at a point which i'm almost there right now i'm only like fifty cents away from that cap 
and if that's the case 
if i retire in six years 
i will be capped out right now so then in other words i'm wanna retire in six years if i don't change jobs 
making exactly what i make now which that was my worst fear of it all but 
that wasn't even on the 
table they were still worried about this two dollars and get this  yeah 
that's what they were fighting for was the low end and didn't 
try to get the hospital and the uh 
main campus the same 
um yeah there's 
you know our shop only has about five people out of twenty maybe that have been here over ten years probably 
lot of turnover 
a lot of 
people go on to management positions and 
or 
leave or 
but once you've got 
and it's like you 
you can't leave now 
you know i'm like 
locked in now so 
you know i will be forty eight when i retire from here and i will be able to go out 
in the workplace and 
feel like i've gotten good education and work skills from working here for this long and 
you know they've definitely paid for classes for me so i don't know what they're big 
gripe is for education when they're striking and all this because 
i've never had a problem if you wanna take a class we get classes 
we can take anything we want so 
it's available it's just whether they go and 
put forth the effort so 
sure 
yeah 
you can take yeah i mean 
people graduate get degrees from ohio state 
working here 
taking one course a  
one course a quarter 
and get a degree in history or whatever it might take them 
to  ten years or something you know but 
it's like why not 
it's free 
yeah why not take advantage of this 
yeah 
why not take advantage of that so 
um i don't know you know 
i've 
keep thinking about that all time but it 
i'm like i want something where i can be off during the summer 
so i can take my kids and we can go out west or you know 
have because my wife's in the same boat she will retire two years after i do and our kids you know will be young 
i five year old and i only have six years to go so we're talking eleven years old 
yeah 
then they won't wanna go anywhere with you 
so 
it's 
a pipe 
now is when i need to 
be 
with them you know where we can 
take them out and run 
yeah 
uh we've been very happy with the o s u daycare i don't know if you have any association with but oh it's 
it's just unbelievable 
our daughter went there her from six weeks all the way up to when she went to first grade 
and uh 
i mean when she got out of that daycare she could read she could write she could do computer you know 
you know 
it's an education it's not 
you know people you pay for it's 
one of your highers but 
you know higher amount of money for 
yeah being a nurse the wife that helps a lot because that's what that thing was really functioning around was nurses getting them some good daycare because they work all these wild shifts and stuff so 
that's how it first started before it you wasn't even on campus it was over on 
like fourth or summit in a church when it first started 
but 
you know 
it's just not 
you know people are always saying i can't believe how much you pay for daycare 
and i'm like but look what we're getting you know 
people take their kids to 
somebody's neighbor's house and 
the lady can be sitting them in front of the tv and 
and nothing happens you know 
over here 
yeah 
over here you have students 
that coming in and work as work studies and this and that and they're in 
the education field or this they're gung ho they're ready to go a quarter changes and a whole group new pumped in you know 
and most of the teachers there are 
mothers themselves and you know they have computers in the room they've learning you know 
it's really you know we've 
sending both of them to kindergarten at o s u too 
they offer a kindergarten program there mainly because it's all day 
where in the hilliard school system and theirs is a half a day so we feel 
we're better off leaving them there 
than 
bussing them to a half a day kindergarten then bussing them to a daycare that's near their school so we might as well do all day plenty of time 
they get a nap 
they you know they get fed and all that so 
been really happy with the daycare there 
mmhmm 
where from 
oh my 
wow 
oh that's it 
mmhmm 
yeah 
there's not a lot around you know 
and we were on the list forever we were on the list five years before we had our  
first kid 
they called 
well are you still wanna be on the list yeah we don't have any children but keep us on the 
you know 
and it's like you said it's a and there's three or four hundred kids in that daycare it's a large daycare 
but 
there's 
not a lot out there that's good quality you know i mean you will it's scary and then you see it in the news and 
then 
they were 
abusing the kids or you know and you don't wanna go to work feeling 
that you're worrying about your kids and we've never really felt like that 
and 
we kind of work a little different shifts my wife and i so 
our kids are only actually there about five hours a day because she doesn't start until nine thirty and i 
pick them up at four so 
yeah i start early and she starts late so she gets 
the one daughter on the bus to go to school and then 
then she can take the boy over to 
the daycare and then they're only there five hours or so 
their daycare 
oh i don't know it's tough i think  
really i believe more in that 
large corporations 
need to 
have some kind of daycare offered it's just there's not that many people anymore that can afford 
to have a one income family i mean you know we could do it you know but 
you know we wouldn't live as nice as we do we wouldn't have as nice of cars as we do you know we'd struggle a little more so 
so it's a toss up it's a real 
you know it's a real worried and you really have to think about it 
when you start getting there because 
it was tough dropping them off when they were six weeks old and you're going oh geezy are we doing the right thing you know 
but 
you know some of the stuff they do and some of the stuff they learn and come home with we 
sit down and talk about it and we're just like i don't think we could have ever dreamed up all this stuff you know 
and you know 
kept them entertained all day long by ourselves you know 
there's no kids in the neighborhood like it was when we were kids you know 
they're all in daycare 
they you know 
you know they just aren't around anymore it's not the same anymore where 
you know every other house had some kids and mom was home and stuff so 
you know they've made a lot of friends through there and they still 
the daughter is in a different school still associates with friends 
that are in other school systems 
that she met at the daycare so 
and they don't know any different 
you know they don't understand the concept so 
they don't know any different of 
you know why didn't we get to stay home they may later when they grow older but 
yeah but i still think 
you know they benefited a lot from it now 
the ultimate would probably be 
a part time thing you know if 
but neither one of our positions offer any type of part time work 
we have some friends that do that where they only go two days a week or something which is 
they get a little bit 
of both the worlds so 
mmhmm you can do part time you can do three or two day a week 
uhhum 
uhhum 
uhhum 
yeah oh yeah 
uhhum 
yeah 
uhhum 
it's a job 
it's a full time 
my wife and i are both like oh 
i can't wait to get 
work 
be easier than this 
you know 
because now they're getting to the age where they're fighting more and you know and you got a boy and a girl and you know 
it's 
you know always something going on 
so 
yeah 
that's 
one of the things we looked when we were 
shopping for homes was we were shopping for schools systems just as much you know so 
and i don't want to buy house and i don't want to have to move when my kids get older to move into a better school system so 
because it seems like since we've bought our house the houses are just 
doubling and tripling in value it's  
yeah 
oh i don't know ours is increased quite a lot since we've been there but 
we've been there i guess 
about ten years 
um 
we live rented in grandview 
before we got 
this was our first house 
grandview has it's own school system too 
but 
yeah 
oh no 
that's one you stay away from 
yeah 
yeah 
we did a lot of searching when we bought our house 
yeah 
it's hard to find what you want in a house 
and get the school system too 
you get in to arlington you get in to 
grandview places like this or bexley 
and the price range we were in 
you were gonna have to dump fifty thousand in to the houses just to 
get them up 
you know we had a list of what we wanted in a house and 
our house was only 
seventeen years old when we bought it but it had everything we wanted 
fireplace full dry basement you know two and a half car garage you know 
all the stuff that we wanted when a lot of the older houses 
wet basements garage burned down or you know 
the lots were packed 
so we live on a golf course and have a creek in the back yard and so it's really 
yeah they don't yeah they play in the creek they don't play golf yet 
the  the daughters are already taking golf lessons 
yeah 
so i don't know 
she likes it 
oh yeah it's so much better than having an alley or sitting there on your deck and look in your house 
the neighbors right behind you you're staring at them sitting on their deck 
we got all woods and a creek and then the golf course so 
so that's hard to find 
in the city limits because we're inside two seventy still so 
yep 
they put them so close these huge homes and then there's ten feet between them and everybody sits in their little backyard with their fence around it and looks at each other 
yeah yeah yeah i was just there's nothing and i was we looked at some of those and my wife's like there's no way we're buying the you know you feel like you're in florida or something 
yeah 
yeah 
where the trees were mature and they didn't really ruin our development and cut down a lot of the large trees 
so 
yeah 
for columbus 
um 
living here all my life 
i don't like it you know 
i like the old cow town 
they can call it what they want i don't  it was easy to get around you'd never had any traffic you don't 
sit on the freeway like you do now now it's like you don't wanna go out at four o clock or you know you just don't wanna get involved in it 
so i don't know growth is good but i guess i'm not into as much as they're 
a lot of other people 
it's good for the economy but 
it's just amazing all the 
every time you turn around they're plopping 
two four hundred 
home unit 
you know developments up here and i'm just thinking 
where are these people all coming from you know you do 
just can't imagine 
where'd these people all move from 
this is getting scary 
yeah what's the big draw you know 
and you know you still see you know when they opened up a lone star steak near our house they couldn't even do lunch because they didn't have the people 
right so you know that it's 
the people are just dying for people to work out there 
yeah 
so 
yeah 
i not some of them just look like you know cracker back 
box houses that you know they put up in a week or  it's 
amazing how you can drive by and then in two weeks drive by and there's fifty homes 
because there's a lot of growth in hilliard hilliards that's starting to scare us actually a little bit because 
now they just built another whole high school so 
two whole high schools i think 
they were up to two or 
three thousand senior graduates last year 
yeah 
yeah that's the worst part there are a lot 
they could really 
double 
they took 
our neighbor is in the sixth grade and 
they took a whole elementary school last year and turned it into sixth grade 
just one school 
so 
that's how many of those there was 
um i don't know 
i think they're enjoying and i don't know you know 
but it's 
mindboggling that it's because i came from a small community there were only two hundred people in my senior class and you knew everybody and now you're talking two whole high schools two football teams you know 
it's just mindboggling all these people you know you graduate with 
you know know of hand full of people and don't know anybody else 
it's like 
you know a lot more of a tight knit group 
as a child so 
we had three elementary schools and one high school and that was it 
yeah 
oh yeah 
you know people i was in kindergarten with i graduated with so 
it's kind of like the small town 
thing 
which would have goods and bads but 
i don't know 
yeah my parents still live there and 
i still associate with a lot of friends i graduated with it's still live in town and 
you know they just had a twenty year reunion here a couple years ago and 
a lot of participation in that 
and so 
oh i don't know just seemed easier you know life was 
it just wasn't the the drivings the main issue with  me you know the freeways we have here weren't built for the amount of people that travel on them now i remember when they built seventy one north 
i remember when they built seventy east you know there were 
no freeways you know and 
yeah i remember going up three fifteen when they first opened it and it was like no body was on it 
you could just drive on it and it was like an empty road 
that no body knew about yet and now it's like a parking lot everyday so 
ya 
it's just a lot of different stuff about it you know that and 
i don't know 
it seems like 
you know 
activities to go do things everything's more crowded it's you know my wife thinks this city's the eat out city 
you know everybody 
if you go anywhere at six thirty 
everybody and their brother is eating 
out all the time it seems like constantly we live near a 
uh 
we live near mill run which is an area 
they've just built up in the last few years that just has 
like twenty restaurants in it that 
you drive by any of those at 
five six o clock 
every lots full to the brim i don't care if it's tuesday thursday you know 
so 
yeah or yeah or you know 
it's tough when you know you've got kids that 
are doing softball soccer you know 
all these events and 
you know like on thursdays when the daughter plays softball my wife leaves the house at eight thirty and she usually 
drives from work to the softball and after that she 
home by nine 
so she's like i can see how you fall into this drive through window business 
you know 
no but luckily you know 
i pick the kids up so that helps a lot i can get them home we can find feed them and i can get them so that's how our life is 
mister mom 
oh you have to nowadays you know i don't understand the men nowadays that believe that the wife 
still does all the duties at home plus has a full time job that just doesn't happen now now you know if your wife didn't work you could expect these things but 
she's doing forty hours a week too so 
it is 
it's work and it's a full time job 
they start shoot the seven year old just brought here it is the end of the year 
second grade she brings home this project 
gonna have to have a book report use three books of reference you know she's never done anything like this it was the battle all weekend long you know getting this 
information out of her you know she had to pick an animal and do a whole 
report on it she gonna have to stand up in front of the class and 
make a box with a display in it and i was just like this is second grade this seems more like you know 
sixth there seems so much more advanced than when we were kids you know 
i can't believe in second grade we were already writing cursive already 
that's all she writes in now 
i mean it seemed like they were teaching it then maybe might be learning some of it 
yeah 
she's in fractions she's doing fractions she's doing percentages already in second grade 
and i thought we were one plus one two 
you know in second grade it just seems like they're three years ahead 
so 
i always wished somebody would redo a survey on that and say you know back in sixty five or whatever 
what's the difference between what they're teaching them then and what they teach them now 
is it really that or is it just our imagination just don't remember enough yeah 
it seems more to me and computers really have helped it 
because 
you know 
the son at five already plays all these adding games and subtraction  and letter games and 
you know at least the day care all the stuff they have on their computer is all education stuff it's not game game it's 
it has a game theme to it but 
you're gonna have to do something to get to the 
game play or whatever 
oh yeah 
you can't get them off 
don't have one at home because we're worried of 
afraid we're gonna get them addicted to the internet or so you know 
because 
the nintendo and those type of things are bad enough they're good baby sitter but you need to limit it 
um i 
it i think it depends on the child and i think it depends on 
the adult as far as the supervision of it 
you know we're very strict as far as 
what games they have 
no you know 
it's so wild you know when we were kids 
cowboy and indians everybody had guns everybody you know if you had the best death act you were the best you know  
and nowadays oh ho 
don't let him have a  you know don't let him play with a you know even a squirt gun you know and so 
you wonder 
whether it's overexaggerated or 
you know none of us grew up 
shooting people or this you know we don't own a fire arm but we played with guns and played cow all these games and 
so i just wonder 
whether this is really 
you know but society's a lot different now 
yeah 
yeah 
and we monitor what they watch 
television wise 
we do a lot of library things get them to the library a couple days a week try to 
keep them interested in books and 
and 
yeah we got actually we use the grandview library they have a really good library there and a 
large selection of videos and they have 
story time things where they read to the kids and get them interested in books and you know 
different type of things where you can 
win things for reading amount of books 
uhhum 
uhhum 
yeah it's great you know and they like it they sing a song they you know 
interact with other kids and 
learn to use the library you know nowadays you know 
people don't go to the library as much either on they you get your information off the internet or 
you buy a books or you know 
yeah 
you know so 
i just we've felt that if we 
introduce them now that 
hopefully this will lead on to later in 
with this way you can monitor their television we let them 
rent a couple movies here and there 
but we see what they rent or you know 
take out compared to you know the cartoon network and all these crazy it's just 
cartoons just seem so worthless nowadays but 
actually you watch some of the older cartoons that we watched 
and they seem more violent than some of the new ones 
you know daffy duck and the road runner and these type of things all it was was kill the fox you know they have that a 
so we're just like wow wait well i don't know if we wanna want let them watch that either so 
yeah they  and disney and disneys pretty strong i mean you know you think of disney and you think of kids 
but you still 
a lot of the stuff they put out is pretty hardcore for a five year old or so i mean you know a lot of the 
dinosaurs and all kinds of stuff it's it's of violent nature 
but 
you gotta 
if you balance it i think you will be all right 
oh yeah absolutely yeah 
it's tough sometimes 
to read the paper at the 
yeah 
yeah 
like this five year old's addicted to the tarzan he likes tarzan movie that was out so 
yeah he wants to 
we've 
kind of boycotted him 
the daughter 
to throw it away 
never 
don't have to watch that again 
yeah because they go back in three days 
now this pokemon 
now it's the pokemon you know oh and they're both like 
i heard somebody somewhere say 
my five year old can name all hundred and fifty pokemon characters but couldn't tell ya his phone number 
and 
and that's true with mine 
he  yeah he show a picture one oh that's 
hu man chu or  
i don't know all the names of them 
and they collect the cards and 
it's a cartoon i believe it started out 
yeah 
and the 
yep the cards with the characters and they all have different powers 
the daughter has this thing called a pokedex 
you know i'm like what's a pokedex you know she i want the pokedex so we get this thing 
it's a little computer you open it up you print in the name of the person you want it puts up 
his picture tells you all the information about him what kind of character is what its powers are what it you know 
like it's mind  yeah it is that's what it is 
of all the pokemon 
and i'm just like i don't know where it leads you know like is it any worse than baseball cards or you know 
probably not it's a fad they're gonna 
move along and move out of it you know 
so 
yeah 
that's what you better hope 
oh yeah 
and you know they're like three fifty for a pack of cards you don't even get gum like we used to 
the baseball cards you know 
yeah you get three you know out of five six cards for three fifty you know and you're like geezy cow and every time you go the store they got them all on the check out lane 
let's get the cards 
now they've done the first hundred and fifty they're moving on to series two you know and 
never oh they are they're killing on it they really are 
yep 
that yep we went to a thing there they were talking about that that 
you gotta figure out what the bainby baby boomers 
are moving into and invest into those type of things you know 
those are the mass people 
you gotta find out and figure out what needs they're gonna roll into like when they get older you know 
you get into the wheel 
somewhere it's just gonna be massive 
because you know 
yeah 
the crew they've gone to town 
oh i'm not really no i was born in fifty eight so no i was past it my sister is more of a baby boomer than yeah 
yeah 
so 
i'm forty two 
yeah 
yeah 
i'm at the end of it all 
seventy seven 
yeah 
that was 
that's hard to believe when you hear all that and see all that again you're just like 
wow wait what were those people thinking 
uhhum 
yeah 
uhhum 
yeah 
yeah 
and it's it's wild it just seems like the music hasn't gone anywhere because they keep going back to the seventy miha 
the rolling stones go touring or pink floyd or you know these are groups from back then where are these people that are supposed to have taken over for these people they're not there you know 
and the quality of the music just must not be there i don't know my daughters into the brittany spears and the 
um 
uh 
backstreet boys n sync all this and now we're starting to get into some of that that's starting to get a little interesting too as far as 
music choices and wanting to listen yeah 
get them the sony walkman and 
then you don't have to listen 
it's 
they 
that when we were kids probably 
i remember our car had an a m radio in it and that was it you know 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
on an album 
you know now the kids are like i want the c d put the c d in 
yeah 
yeah 
yep i've heard that too 
i just differ 
it's different and you know i keep trying to figure out now was it worse when they were this age or is this worse you know 
you know now then you can talk to some other people that are oh you haven't seen anything yet wait until they just don't even want to be in sight with you and don't wait till they you know 
i'm not going on a vacation with you i couldn't spend a week there with you 
so 
you hope that doesn't happen but 
i've heard friends say you know their thirteen year olds just rolled over from one to the other you know from the best kid in town to 
you know i'm running away i'm never going to school again so 
it's tough and you wonder what causes it 
yeah 
yeah is it the family you know where where'd you go wrong you know 
somebody needs to figure it out 
that's it that's what i worry about the larger school systems too 
that's whats 
concerns 
me with hilliard you get such a large variety of people 
compared to like where i was in this smaller group and you knew everybody and this and that it's 
your parents knew their parent yeah your parents knew their parents their parents knew that you know 
now 
you know and i walked to my friends house and half her friends if she's going over to play they got to drive them almost because they're 
they're all around 
so 
it's not the neighborhood thing as much 
yeah and you can't let them run around as much as we did you know we rode our bikes everywhere we rode to the pool we rode down to the store 
and now you're scared to let them ride around anywhere because you're afraid they're not gonna come back you know 
and so yeah 
it's 
so many different things 
um it wasn't bad 
it was you know i enjoyed a lot oh yeah 
i watched the first open heart 
transplant i saw 
the first liver transplant 
saw a lot of stuff like that and met a lot of  
yeah i met a lot of different people in there 
lot of interesting people 
um 
i helped them set up different things helped them 
you know clean them up afterwards prep patients 
all kinds of different things 
there was a lot of blood and stuff but 
i don't know 
when you 
when it's not you it seems a little 
easier to 
observe i 
when you see somebody you know it's a little 
more concerning to you i don't know 
but 
you'd see a lot of different stuff and 
you hope that the majority of it's 
helping this person out now my wife you know she works 
she worked in intensive care open heart surgery different patients like that 
that's a lot different than where she is now 
with the cancer because there's so many different factors there you're 
you know  she says it's so hard to see somebody 
thirty years old and 
they come in and they have 
uh  breast cancer or something like that and you have to go in and tell them these things she says you know 
two or three times a week you know your 
your heart just drops out because you see that they have their little kids and 
now you're gonna be going for chemotherapy radiation all this stuff you know 
it's unbelievable how many 
it's just hard to believe how many 
people 
go through there 
they're talking fifty sixty patients a day 
where she works and this is just o s u's breast cancer place so 
it  i just 
i can't believe there's that many people that 
need the service all the time 
there's like five or six different doctors and 
so she's learned a lot more 
now than cancer because she's never been in oncology at all so 
it was always just trauma patients or open heart 
bypass patients things like that 
so 
it's been a whole new learning experience for her too 
oh no she has to do yeah it's chaos up there 
it is chaos 
it's i mean they had somebody come in to 
oversee the whole 
setup to  
you know where they needed more help at whether they needed more nurses or  and the guy 
told her the person that was in charge the head nurse or whatever 
there's no way that person can do that job 
you know 
they still do it you know 
so when you're in charge it's just a nightmare you're supposed to know where every single patient is where their chart is what's going on what room they're in where you know 
you're just 
walking around like you're a crazy person all day 
then it's come home 
come home to that 
and it's so different it's i don't know it's just 
the motherly thing the 
just 
you know they draw to their mothers 
it's just the way it is i guess but 
it's like you know she says if the mother's in the house the mother's on duty 
because you know they 
they bypass me straight mom mom mom 
you know 
yeah 
she's just like 
yeah the minute we walk in the door 
it's like you guys 
clock out 
yeah oh yeah the five year old just 
after her the whole time the minute she walks in the door you know 
go go go so 
it's tough 
oh they i do 
i try to be as much as possible too i think it it's very important that 
both parents 
they see both 
i do 
most my friends 
most people i associate with in this and that are 
a lot more involved in their with their kids than 
say our parents were as kids you know 
oh no 
no 
i don't feel that at all they 
you know 
we don't hesitate 
our 
to get together with other friends and take our kids places i don't remember my dad doing that stuff you know two or three dads get together and take six kids 
to the park or something you know 
i don't remember things like that 
you know 
he could have been there maybe but 
you know we take them to wyandot lake or you know the zoo or all types of things 
oh yeah we got a 
the best thing you gotta get a membership to everything that's what we figured out we got cosi we got the zoo and we got wyandot lake 
and that way you can go whenever you want 
if 
an hour into the show 
they're not participating properly 
you can leave and you  you're not out 
you know yeah 
you know that cosi's great we really like that 
they 
really 
oh 
oh yeah we're members of there 
oh yeah we've probably been five six times already 
and 
it's huge 
you can't see it in a day 
you can't especially with kids 
it's just too overwhelming 
yeah 
at cosi 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yep 
yep there's a big water area it's something to do with the little mermaid or whatever 
but 
they really enjoy 
all that 
we try to 
do as much as we can with them 
outdoor type of thing we do a lot of  
we do a lot of vacationing we try to go two times a year at least 
uh her parents live in cape cod so they 
we can get to the beach and take them there we have family in florida we have family in hawaii we have family in 
virginia beach so 
everybody's  
everybody's coastal but us 
and my sister lives in the middle of 
nobody visits 
nobody wants 
to nebraska 
yeah what's out there 
come watch the corn grow 
so 
yeah 
she does 
she comes back a lot 
they 
yeah they really like it they have a huge house 
in the 
middle of nowhere out on a  and 
my brother in law bought 
uh 
his father's 
wendy's businesses out 
and so they own like six wendy's out there so 
but it's out in the middle of nowhere that was the whole problem we tried to get him to move and tried to get him to do this years and years ago and 
nobody wanted to move to nebraska he was doing them from ohio which is really duh 
running five wendy's in nebraska and commuting 
so he was 
either driving or flying a lot 
no i think 
think they fly to omaha 
so it's not too bad that's pretty easy to get into 
they're about two hours west of omaha 
so 
it's different for them 
they're liking it you know 
small  
living out in the country raising the kids you know their big house huge yard dog you know 
i 
we keep looking and saying you know now how's this different or better for the kids so 
they're uh five hours from  so they still bad lands aren't too far  
and i guess it's like 
nine hundred miles from here so they can still drive back 
so 
they come 
at least once twice a year 
back to ohio 
okay 
no big deal 

yes um 
undergraduate 
student 
first year 
finishing it up 
oh yeah 
oh it's definitely the 
the beginning 
the beginning of the end 
yep 
um grew up in upper arlington 
not far 
yeah really those five miles make such a difference though 
like 
because i yeah because i live on campus 
yeah 
i live in uh siebert hall 
oh yeah i got 
i think there are a hundred and seventy of us here for just from my class alone 
uh four twenty five 
yeah it's been like that every year basically 
yeah it's usually like about a third or something 
i think maybe two thirds of them live on campus 
it's just basically getting out of the house 
just to get away from my parents for a while 
you know and it's kind of good for me just to be away 
it's part of the experience 
like learning do my own laundry and stuff i used 
so bad about it and now all of a sudden 
i'm 
don't care really 
i i don't care about like having to do it 
like my mom even wants me to do hers over summer i'm like okay 
fine 
yeah i think so 
um 
met quite a few people from cleveland 
and then my roommate is from north canton 
no not really um all my good friends from 
well i'd say like 
out of all my good friends from high school one of them no two of them are still here 
um i do so much just 
not uh one of them i see just got 
back from lunch with i mean i see him 
every day the other one i don't see that much anymore 
um well 
she's got a boyfriend so she's busy 
and she lives off campus too 
so 
she lives out in hilliard actually it's far 
uhhum 
yeah she had an apartment in arlington and so they wanted to get an actual house 
so they built one out in hilliard 
yeah she still lives with family 
um um 
um huh 
um 
well the opinion kind of like the general consensus around upper arlington is that o s u is not a good enough school 
for everybody so you've you want to go to ivy league you don't even want to look here 
you know so 
they offered to accept me to med school here 
okay 
i will stay 
yeah i'm in a uh 
in the guinea pig class of this program through the medical school where after three years of undergrad i go to med school here 
like without m cats or anything 
um i get a 
b s which they 
mail to me after first year of 
medical school 
like they figure that uh gross anatomy and all that's enough 
biology experience 
actually i do wasn't even that sure that i wanted to do it until um 
like 
senior year and the opportunity came up and i said to her 
oh 
this sounds cool 
you know i had thought of myself as a uh a chemist 
for a long time 
and that this opportunity came up 
yeah i'd applied to 
like other places 
and i got into university of chicago 
and i wanted to go there and then 
this came up here and also i mean 
it's just ridiculously cheaper here i didn't want 
debt after 
that's just pathetic 
um my counselor just kind of found it and he'd posted it and he specially 
um 
tried to notify the national merit people about it 
and i was the only one who really caught it even though the other ones like half of them wanted to go to medical school 
they all 
one of them is at princeton right now 
you know and they're 
all off at their ivy leagues 
like basically working their butts off to 
get in when 
i'm already in 
i don't totally understand it 
yeah ohio state is like a really good medical school i don't 
i don't know i think they just mainly didn't want to go to o s u like their egos or something you know 
i'm thinking of one in particular you know rich parents just 
wanted to go somewhere else 
yeah he they could afford to go there so they did 
i think 
um 
the people who have already graduated they're like the doctors and the the dentists and all the people who went here have a really good reputation 
like among adults it's just that the kids want to go 
it it's just thought of as a somewhat party school 
i think outside of the honors program a lot of it is 
but 
within the honors program i think there's some really really exceptional things going on 
yeah 
um 
one of the requirements is we have to been in the honors college during undergraduate 
and 
fulfill all the requirements there 
um you get priority for scheduling 
you have to apply for it like seperately and i think you have to have like certain 
um 
class standing and s a t scores 
or you can write an essay and they will let you in anyways 
um 
let's see 
you get 
priority 
for scheduling the i think you go after 
varsity athletes and disabilities and that's it 
yeah 
i think they do 
yeah 
they do 
um 
let's see 
you have to complete either a thesis 
or a contract which just consists of taking lots of honors classes 
and they have honors classes which are separate 
and 
they're supposed to be with like better faculty 
and 
um 
smaller class size and a little more challenging 
my honor's class is challenging and organic 
chemistry is very challenging but 
no it's not 
it's 
regular's enough for me in that 
and i didn't have 
i couldn't schedule the honors 
yes they do 
uh i almost think the honors would be better just because of smaller class size i have like four hundred in my class right now 
but 
it kind of helps actually because uh 
you have all the people in there who are not honors and they don't know how to  like the partiers they don't know how to study or anything so 
you know 
it helps the curve 
yeah i have to take organic i have to take 
um 
biology chemistry physics 
and then 
um i have to complete 
a major 
if it's biology i get a break i don't uh i only have to take twenty nine hours of it 
but other ones you have take the full major 
you know some people are doing uh 
gosh i think one's doing business 
and one's doing economics and 
i think they're doing different things like different people in the program but i kind of decided to take the easy road 
hm um early admission pathway 
uhhum 
there  
fifteen 
yeah um the medical school has pretty much limited them to ten percent of the class 

of the medical school class which is two hundred twenty 
yeah 
yeah i will be starting in two thousand 
three 
um 
the first year they made it 
in state only 
um second 
and the second class that they're gonna be starting they have some people from michigan i think 
you know they're just trying to spread out a little bit and eventually it will be something 
a little more nationwide 
but they really just wanted to start off with something easy 
and um they only take national merit scholars in there 
so 
um 
national merit scholars also get full in state tuition 
the 
that's why it's mainly appealing to in state people you they pay you to go to school 
yeah that is one of the uh 
one of the 
whether if it 
it's a written goal or not that's what they're doing 
yeah it is 
and 
it seems to me that they don't keep the very very best of the kids 
in state but it gets a lot of the 
like 
just below the absolute best in 
it keeps a lot of them here 
where they could go somewhere else 
um i think 
just having like 
such a low cost  
really helps 
and um 
i don't know i think having just  having the word 
honors gives it 
some kids enough prestige that they don't 
totally freak out about not going ivy league 
yeah parents are very into this um my sister 
has no idea where she wants to go but uh 
they took me around to all the different colleges to be sure what i wanted 
they're just like 
go to o s u 
yeah well she went with us last time and 
she liked some stuff but 
i think she will end up coming here anyway 
um i went to 
me see i applied to emory 
harvard 
duke 
university of chicago and washington university 
so 
i got into three of those 
and 
they they were 
neat places but 
i know 
oh 
definitely 
definitely i'm such a slacker here it's 
yeah 
from what i hear actually the like the emory and the 
um 
university of chicago you have to work really hard 
because they get all the kids who wish they would have got into harvard and then start 
you know try to make it up by working harder you get to actual harvard nobody works 
because they're like we already made it you know 
yeah i mean like it just 
it provides an a 
a window of opportunity for those who really do work like 
i know the valedictorian of harvard 
like in the junior class i'm 
she went to my school she just barely works at all apparently 
yeah 
like 
nobody 
oh she is really 
plain smart i 
but you don't 
really have to work as hard there apparently 
yeah i yeah that's 
another thing i hear about 
yeah 
yeah i hear about suicide rates when you don't get in 
i uh i think 
yeah i think i got really good uh um 
i've actually been sitting thinking about it like what departments in school were good and which ones weren't 
um 
the foreign language is really good they have immersion classes from like at second level 
so i got into an immersion class here everybody else was freaking out and i was just used to it 
you know 
um no english 
totally 
like the directions and the homework 
and everything is all 
one hundred percent in german 
so it and we had like tapes we listened to of native speakers so 
you 
got 
really good really quick 
my 
yeah 
it was like freshman or sophomore year 
yeah um i took one oh four 
during 
winter quarter 
so that's all that they required i'm thinking about taking some extra anyway just because i like it 
that's why i started it 
now i just like it anyway and 
i like their culture a lot 
um i've been there twice already 
yep 
um both times 
i stayed around this little town uh 
it's like northwest of munich 
so it's southern 
um mossberg 
oh 
you know of those areas 
oh okay 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah it was little had a little gymnasium in it 
yeah 
um well the first time i went officially with the exchange program the second time 
i just went 
and the exchange program happened to be there at the same time but i didn't go like under their insurance or on the same flight as them 
i just kind of met up with them 
it was more fun without being with 
without being with them 
yeah i could 
skip any program i wanted to 
you know just show up at the parties basically 
um 
i like how everybody's just a little more relaxed about stuff 
you know like uh work hard 
when you have to 
you know which 
when you should is a 
better way of putting it 
um 
and then 
when you don't take it easy 
yeah i think basically normal hours would be like eight to twelve and then you go home during 
lunch time because that's the big meal of day you go home and 
eat with your family 
that's 
really important 
and then 
um 
like people who work go back 
until like you know maybe two to six 
um the kids are done with school for the day at 
like twelve one 
uhhum 
oh yeah yeah you work really hard while you're at it 
and then when you're done you're done 
yeah 
and they're less hyper about like 
you know 
bad things for people to do you know the the drinking the smoking there's not as 
strict about it basically 
i mean you you kind of suffer your own consequences more 
rather than having society like yell at you for it 
no they don't actually 
um 
it's kind of funny you're allowed to drink before you're allowed to drive 
so um 
there's 
from what i hear one of the exchange kids was in a car with a drunk person and had quite an experience with it 
i mean no crash or anything but 
was 
rather 
scared 
kind of shaken up by it but um 
no they're 
very very serious about designated drivers 
and um 
apparently when you're a car 
um they have a very very 
like zero tolerance 
for alcohol 
like on your breath at all 
yeah they do 
their trains are so cool i love those 
yeah they are 
yep 
yeah 
yep 
yeah they're they're really good about that 
uhhum 
yeah they do 
i thought it was really cool we went hiking in the alps and somebody told us that 
um 

if you are determined as having too much stress by your doctor then the government will pay for a vacation for you 
just they're that into 
being sure you're relaxed enough 
you know and nobody does the sixty hour work weeks like 
some people apparently are accustomed to around here 
i mean forty is like the limit 
yeah they do um 
i think it's something like sixty percent 
um we pay like forty fifty here 
oh yeah 
well there's like 
and you take federal and state and all that and add it up 
yeah they have 
uh 
well okay they do have sales tax but it's added in to the price before 
so you're not just 
sitting there trying to figure out what it is 
i wish they could 
yeah oh my uh 
i'm in this uh venturing crew which is 
through boy scouts our leader has this 
like 
society totally planned out 
he's got this thing like 
thirty percent sales tax and no other tax at all and then 
it all 
gets 
i don't know it all works itself out he he 
every other day you start him on taxes and he will just start fuming 
it's 
um 
he's uh business man 
he really doesn't like it 
like how things work 
yeah 
it's called  uh venturing crew 
it's kind of this off  off shoot of uh boy scouts 
and it's for ages teen twenty one 
uh co ed 
so 
we focus on computers but 
we 
do camping and 
you know 
he teaches us a lot of uh business uh business ethic and 
um professionalism as well 
yes 
yeah 
it's 
like um 
i don't know they used to have something called exploring posts 
that were directly related and then 
um 
venturing kind of took over for that like 
in still in boy scouts and then 
exploring went off on it's own 
and 
as a result they took religion out of the program and they put 
they  like homosexuality with the leaders and all that 
so it's 
i don't know we call it like hippy boy scouts 
um one of my best friends from 
high school and my boyfriend are both in it 
and 
they bugged me about it for ever to come and like i don't know about computers 
so they 
took me finally like december something 
and and i have an office within the posi- within the um 
program now and 
yeah and it's just incredible how much i've learned 
i think i learn more in that program than i do in all my classes put together 
yes and no 
i mean 
we have high schoolers in there 
um 
there's no requirements for what school you go to um 
but we get 
our 
internet service partially through ohio state 
and 
the vast majority of college students go here 
um what happened was we know see one of the 
people on our committee 
teaches in the math department here 
so he the math server has tons of extra room on it 
so he just kind of snuck in our account 
i it is legal but i'm not 
sure how related to university is 
i don't think we take up huge amount and then uh we get some of the service through oar net as well 
which is 
i think it's just up lane avenue 
uh they give us the domain name and all that 
yeah i 
oh gosh seems like incredible i mean 
i i used to not understand what the right click on windows was 
that was like when i moved in and now all of a sudden like 
i can't i installed my own d v d player in my computer 
like tore the case off and did it 
it's actually not that difficult but 
yeah  it's um 
i mean you just know where it goes and you throw it in and 
there it is 
you know 
um 
let's see what was 
my 
decoder card was a little more difficult i had somebody else do it for me 
um i have a decoder card it 
what it does is it make 
it decodes the d v d 
right away rather than sending it through the processor 
so 
it's 
it's a lot faster it doesn't depend on my processor time like it 
the movie doesn't skip or anything 
it it just goes straight through 
um 
let's see 
no no nothing like that uh 
twice a month we have 
our technical modules which are 
we hook up the tiny little you know green screen computers and the little old keyboards from like nineteen eighty five 
you know sit there and tinker on those 
and then once month we will have a leadership module which is uh 
the business ethics 
part 
and 
you know set goal setting and that type thing 
and then once month we will just have like donatos pizza 
and like 
just just discuss basic 
and just general things 
we will like events coming up we had 
we planted the flowers at murfield 
last weekend and the weekend before 
was it two 
i don't know i can't wait for it to start just because i want to watch it on tv and like i planted those 
you see the the nick 
jack nicholas golf statue 
in front of the clubhouse i planted the flowers around that 
no i i don't want to watch it for the golf at all i just want turn it on and see it occasionally 
yep 
yeah i probably will 
yeah 
um yeah actually 
they had just posted something on the  on the email today they have these old machines that used to be 
uh they're called three b twos and 
a t and t used to run on them 
and they're just really old and 
i mean just ridiculously like seventies 
just ridiculous and he's giving them out 
but the only thing is if you take one you have to finish 
like you have to 
um 
install a disk drive 
and there are no computer manuals for it so you have to figure it out totally on your own 
i'm thinking i may get into that 
for like summer project or something 
i like this stuff as opposed to like sitting around and playing computer games first of all because 
it's more interesting it's a lot more practical 
you know it's little more problem solving less running around and shooting things 
you know um 
it's like problem solving type 
you know little puzzles it's 
not as much 
sit in front of a tv and be entertained it's 
you create your own 
entertainment 
no
um 
it's an ego trip that's all 
basically 
it's like look i can do this 
you know i was sitting down uh in my boyfriend's room 
and my roommate was sitting up in my room alone and i had my computer on 
but 
nobody was sitting at it 
and 
um 
from downstairs 
we broke into my computer 
and started playing uh m p threes 
like while she was studying or something i think we played this homer simpson stuff 
she got so mad it was so worth it 
she's the type of person i love to annoy 
my roommate 
we have uh 
yeah we have 
typical dorm room 
uh we have 
um 
desks 
and then lofted beds 
you have the option take your bed down i had to take mine down because i broke my ankle fall quarter 
so it's 
still just sitting down and my computer sits next to it 
um 
the only thing is if you take it down you can only have half a desk 
that's still enough for me 
a place for 
computer to sit and my plants sit in the corner and then 
i have my little 
paper stack 
mm 
you should uh 
you should be organized i'm not 
i have this stack of like groceries maybe about a foot high sitting 
next to my bed 
just when we out and bought groceries and then the commons 
open again 
oh they it was nice 
actually 
i ate 
a 
lot more healthy 
and 
um it was cheaper i was getting money on my buck i d 
so i actually got paid every day 
yeah 
they gave us nine dollars a day it was like nine twenty five for what meal plan i was on 
so then 
um we bought like pop tarts and that lasted for like a week of breakfast 
for two bucks you know you can't beat that 
and then um 

see 
usually go out to 
lunch at like  
fast food place 
and then we get together and cook dinner 
yeah we have a little kitchen 
uh i've learned a lot about cooking 
lately 
i i thought 
in the beginning i missed mirror lake cafe so bad because the good subs and all that 
i don't 
i don't know why i missed them i don't 
i go back and now i just don't like it anymore 
yeah i've been thoroughly spoiled you know like catfish biff subs those are 
oh  
they're very good 
like you call 
i usually just call and then i walk down and by the time i get there 
the subs are ready 
oh is it 
it's a little farther 
yeah 
no not really 
i don't know what even is to eat down here 
oxleys 
oxleys is probably the 
closest place 
and those little hot dog stands 
those really don't count 
which one is that 
yeah 
adriatico's 
uhhum 
mondays and tuesdays 
they have  
cheap pizza 
yeah they have a deal  monday and tuesday i think it's like after five p m 
the 
pizzas really cheap 
yeah 
yeah that wouldn't work 
our dorms were cleaner 
our our janitor is worthless 
basically it  we were complaining about it like earlier during the year 
three complaints have uh formal complaints 
have been filed against him and he still refuses to change the bleach water 
like more than once a week 
it's really 
disgusting 
so we had these temps come in one day and it was 
we went in uh like we're in shock it was so clean 
they did they didn't come every  but you know they came occasionally and it helped and 
we mopped our own floor like on the hall a few times it we just basically need the 
bathrooms done 
you know and i wouldn't be too opposed to do that myself if it would keep the cost down around here 
you know 
i don't 
i don't know commons i don't i didn't miss bus service i kind of missed because 
um 
aaron's car is out 
on west campus but 
i went home and got my dad's a 
he teaches in the dental school but he only teaches on fridays 
so he has that a pass available all the time 
so our car is parked  next to the building 
yeah we're gonna have to give it up by friday 
because 
the strike's over they won't let us keep it 
anymore 
oh i wish yeah i do it during summer too i usually work down here 
just over summer and i use the a pass 
and then i drive my dad down on fridays 
yeah 
i  
they're justified to go on strike anytime they want to however how they 
behaved during the strike was just  i mean 
like sitting out  the street all the time like 
uh 
honking the horns ringing the bells doing the  the 
really annoying chants um 
i had classes in the b and z 
building 
that we just had to cancel because they were too loud 
um 
yeah across streets the dental 
and the hospital 
so people were really loud down there 
and we couldn't have class  
in addition they were like trying to tip over buses and throwing stones at them 
when they drove by i guess 
there's no need to attack students over it and 
i read some article 
in the lantern i don't know why i read that but um 
i hate that paper but anyway 
um i read some article that the guy said he's not trying to attack students he just wants them to get annoyed so they will  whine to their parents about how the university does it 
and then they can all fight the establishment and 
it makes me 
angry that people like that even get 
money 
no it didn't as a matter of fact i told my parents you know 
university is handling it 
so well by  
giving them the money because they don't deserve it 
you know 
and 
yeah  
yeah 
um 
it was just  
disgusting how they  
a lot of yelling at  
that was  unnecessary 
i they 
just totally approached it from the wrong 
point and 
i mean there were some students that actually  
supporting them 
and they were being very vocal about it but the vast majority of people that i 
talked to 
were so against the strikers 
yeah they were  pro strike were getting money on buck i d's but yeah 
we wanted it to keep on going 
but 
they just didn't need to 
do like that and then i think once they noticed that the uh 
commons were gonna open without them they realized that 
university is functioning 
or was functioning fine without them 
and decided to go back to their jobs 
if you noticed the first time that they voted 
they voted down this proposal the proposal that their voting on this week is the exact same one 
uh nobody really admits it but 
oh i grabbed the paper because i wanted to see what the agreement was and it's 
pretty much the same thing 
and 
voting positively for it this time 
i wouldn't 
i wouldn't doubt it 
i hope they vote against it but i don't think they will 
just because it's been 
three weeks now you know 
and 
not 
only that there's uh something in the deal like they lose their benefits after two weeks and  union has to pay their full wages for the work that they miss 
union's not gonna do that 
yeah 
hm 
yeah 
i just think you can't 
you can't call for across the board 
raises there definitely some people there who deserve a lot more money than what they're getting 
and there are some people that deserve to be fired 
and there's no way that you can really 
differentiate just because they're in a union they 
take that  
it's really unfortunate for the good workers in there because 
i mean the people at mirror lake are so  
yeah they're all   
you know and  
work hard 
you know to make it 
easier on the students 
you know totally restructured the place since the beginning of the year 
just to make it easier on everybody 
it's good place 
they even stopped playing the ghetto music 
they had this jukebox and it was  they played the same three songs with like horribly offensive lyrics and  
melody whatsoever 
they stopped doing that now 
yeah probably 
i just think 
horribly biased paper they don't 
really take their  
what is it  
like 
integrity they don't take that seriously 
oh it's most of it is liberal 
and 
always find some way  
misrepresent 
like 
kirwan 
they always find some 
silly way to slant his words and make him  bad and 
it's really disgusting i 
yeah 
yeah  
since it's not 
sponsored officially by  
university they can do whatever they want and they don't have any 
um 
i'm looking for a word here 
uh repercussions 
no they're not it's printed at the top every 
on every issue 
that they are 
financially  independent 
so therefore they can 
they're not public they can put whatever they want 
i am during different points of the day 
as far as affiliated with 
a party 
i  
respond  
republicans more than democrats  
i think given any 
um 
given any choice of any 
party 
at all 
i'm probably more libertarian than anything else 
just 
you know it's 
let people make their own mistakes and then 
but don't make me pay for it yeah 

who am i going to vote for 
i have no idea it's kind of like picking the 
the least of evils i mean 
i don't really see anybody i was totally ready to vote for elizabeth dole and then 
she opened her mouth and things came out 
uh she had the best chance out of any uh 
any woman that's ever run 
for president and 
she was 
in a major party 
which 
hasn't happened before 
and it would have been really funny to see what happened to bob dole over it 
you know be the first 
man after  run for the office 
i don't know 
i 
i kind of see al gore winning just because 
he's the most like 
one of the  
he has the most experience 
in that 
general  
um 
i don't know i don't particularly like 
anyone 
really 
although i haven't been paying a lot of attention to it 
just because 
i don't know 
yeah and because 
i 
back when i was in high school in my a p government class i was paying attention a lot you know like 
i read the  
columbus dispatch everyday and i read u s news and world report 
for my economics class and i was 
totally caught up with everything 
and then i got here like 
i don't  
i don't care 
you know 
yeah and 
i i got to argue about stuff there here i'm just kind of sitting around 
like trying to cram organic into my head and 
playing around with my linux 
yeah a lot more 
just 
different 
things 
yeah just 
keeping my 
g p a up enough and 
yeah i really really hate the fact 
of a government telling me what to do 
i really hate that 
um 
and like affirmative action stuff totally burns me up the idea is wonderful but it's 
it's just 
executed very poorly 
i mean i saw like 
during high school how easy it was for me to get in to places i mean the citadel was begging me to come 
yeah yeah they called me like a few times and just begging me to come i know how hard that is for 
uh 
white males to get into 
it's 
and i saw like one of my friends had to work so hard to get into m i t 
and then 
there was another girl who 
i really didn't think was 
that smart she's kind of 
um 
inner blond 
and she got in 
yeah 
yeah it's just 
i see it working 
and 
i 
don't think that it 
is just 
executed properly 
so 
i would almost rather have it 
not at all 
than 
have it executed 
as it is now 
think in the case of a tie it should be used but 
you know like if there's 
a black woman who is 
very well qualified for a job 
and a white male is 
equally qualified for the job the black woman should get it 
but 
i'm like if test scores are identical and they have the exact same experience 
you know objective 
ways 
they are identical 
then the black woman should get the job 
but 
there is no 
to me 
the most qualified should  person should get the job 
end of story 
and that's it 
you know it's 
it's best for 
society in general 
just employers need to be 
employers just need to do that on their own 
and it's tough to be able to trust 
uh business like that but 
it's a private business they need to be able to 
you know they can do whatever they want 
um 
i do not like 
i just don't 
um 
i think it's 
it's kind of like you get what you pay for 
anyway and 
um 
i'm not saying in general but with the experiences that i've had 
um certain families where they don't 
uh socioeconomically just not as well off 
it doesn't matter how much money they're given for their education they've  
they won't take 
proper advantage of it 
because  
they 
have their parents to look up to 
who didn't take advantage of it 
you know so if it's kind of the mentality if my parents did okay without it then i don't need it 
so the money's just kind of wasted 
oh yeah 
yes 
yes 
hum 
no i haven't 
okay 
no i haven't been following it really 
it's not that the 
property taxes are that much higher anyway it's that 
um 
the homes are worth more because of the school system 
and the safety of the neighborhood and 
yeah there there are a few things 
really that go into it 
yeah it basically 
feeds into itself in that manner rather than high taxes 
exorbitantly high i mean they it is a little higher but yeah 
it it's not ridiculously high 
yeah 
it is 
worth more 
what i can't understand is some people live in upper arlington 
and they send their kids to 
i don't understand that 
yeah you spend the money to live there and then you go somewhere else 
i really don't understand that 
some people do it 
yeah it was pretty much upper middle class 
um 
and like even the people the maybe their apartments didn't look as impressive but they were making money 
and like 
uh one of my friends 
who had the apartment 
in arlington 
they had this little apartment 
she's from 
india 
um 
her house in india is like this mansion and they have servants there 
i mean it's 
really 
impressive just 
the 
houses are just worth more so you can't get as much house here 
but yeah everybody is doing well 

yeah 
it depends on what area you live in too 
the area where i live in you get 
little house 
because you're close to everything 
whereas you get kind of farther away from the center of 
the area you can get a bigger house and 
there's some really really pretty ones 
yeah and um the  
the uh smaller house like 
bigger squished in areas 
are 
uh the older area 
and then as the 
community fanned out then 
they had bigger houses 
i like living in the old area better 
i like the houses in the new area better 
there's one in particular that's just 
gorgeous 
they have this 
entrance and there are these trees on the inside of the house they're just growing down into everything and there are like crystals and they have this one room that looks like a sphinx and then they have 
um 
this backyard that looks all you know cute 
old england 
it's really really cool house 
has this little bridge that goes up to the front door 
and a creek i 
um yes some of the guys from venturing crew live there 
yeah we did 
we had a um they called lan parties 
they are parties where everybody takes their computer and you hookthem up to  into a network and then you play games 
you know we had one of the parties up there and 
they had this 
um big like pyramid shaped thing 
i i forget what they call it 
it's like a crystal something 
i don't know but they have a speaker hook up to it 
and the structure of it makes the sound resonate like crazy 
they have subwoofers sitting under it and there's this bed in the middle so i ended up falling asleep there one night 
somebody woke me up with the music ah 
oh it's 
yeah it's definitely weird 
it's really cool 
yeah 
yeah 
very new age 
uhhum 
got a few ideas 
um i'm thinking i might be a o b g y n just 
they need a lot of women in that field 
you know they needs 
good people there 
um 
the money didn't hurt 
just 
it's good money 
yeah 
um one idea that i've just had recently is medical informatist 
which 
is a person who has an m d 
and does computers 
since those are my two main interests i thought 
doing both would be really cool 
and i'm meeting with someone on thursday actually who's 
in that field 
it's really just an open field 
yeah 
uh it's 
it is where bioinformatics was about a year or two ago 
just really starting to get started and i mean 
somebody 
you have an m d that's enough you know you want somebody who has computer skills as well 
that's 
difficult to find 
yeah the other way around is probably even harder 
it does 
yeah you just see like 
all the different kinds 
i think even if i don't want to go into it you know 
rotations in every single 
area will be interesting like 
i shadowed in the uh 
psych ward last week 
and 
that was really interesting 
and i have feeling i'm gonna love my rotation but i 
don't want to be a psychiatrist 
no as for it was kind of disturbing actually 
yeah 
yeah i saw the patients in the morning 
yep 
oh yeah 
yeah 
oh um well i thought about being a medical scientist 
with m d p h d they do um 
research 
like 
um 
with applications to medicine but more in the 
biochemistry field 
or genetics or something like that 
that 
that would be seriously fun 
but 
uh it depends if you work industry you get money 
if you work at a college 
or 
a hospital you make 
no money 
yeah pretty much 
it seems like it 
i 
i wanted to for a long time now i'm just not so sure that i want the 
two or three more years of school 
they suggest two to three years for your p h d like 
i don't wanna do that 
too much 
um yeah 
that's 
what they suggest doing is two years of med school 
get your p h d 
and then do your 
last two years of med school 
and then you do 
your residency 
you don't have to do a residency but 
if you ever wanna 
go clinical 
you have to do it 
yeah 
yeah just ridiculous amounts of stuff i'm like 
i don't wanna do that 
yeah 
yeah i would be at least thirty maybe looking uh towards forty before i have the experience really necessary 
to get into good jobs like 
i don't wanna be i mean like 
my 
uh 
venturing crew 
advisor is thirty eight and retired i mean 
i i'm going more for there 
um a lot of good investments a lot of saving 
a lot of living well below means 
and i wanna own six businesses 
yeah um his definition of 
retired is basically um 
he doesn't have to work 
he does but he doesn't have to so 
he just finished up a temp job up at uh qwest 
yep i think he gets paid like three seventy five an hour now 
yeah that's how he gets so much money he says 
i 
will be paid this much 
and i will be given this many um had this much minimum per day 
or i'm not working for you and 
they usually say no no no we won't do that you know and then they will call back a week later 
okay we will take you 
he has some really good stories about that 
oh yeah 
he has qualifications businesses and also with uh unix 
which is 
um 
i don't know do you know anything about unix 
okay 
yeah he does 
i think he specializes in like solaris and h p u x 
and 
yeah he says he knows 
the v m s as well but 
he doesn't like to do it so he doesn't do it 
yeah he's teaching us uh system five 
it's 
okay 
um 
it's 
like two now 
okay 

alright 
um 
we will i've 
lived in columbus all my life 
never 
can't say i ever really leave too often 
um 
i have a brother sister 
uh 
obviously parents they're 
divorced i live with my mom 
um i live up around the beechwold area 
uh 
really as 
far as ohio state goes i'm a freshman here 
uh just started winter quarter 
um 
i like it for the most part it's little bit 
much 
much different actually than 
high school was and that kind of 
surprised me just 
all the sorts of changes and  
things like that going on 
but other than that i mean i seem to like it i mean it's 
definitely changes for the better it's a lot more 
just free i mean i get to do 
whatever you want i mean there's no one 
watching over you saying what you have to do all the time and 
everything like that 
um 
i am signed up for architecture right now 
which 
i like architecture but i think there's probably more time 
into it than i'm ready to 
actually commit into it 
and so i think i will 
probably end up changing i don't know what to it'd probably be more towards the education line 
um just i mean i like everything about architecture i mean that's actually 
what i do as a job right now i mean i'm 
like building things i'm 
like adding on a 
bedroom and a bathroom 
onto a house 
but 
it's just 
more time consuming than i think i'm ready 
to put into it 
um 
yes and no i mean 
in high school it was a bunch of little things here it's 
not so much a lot of things 
it's  
major things that you have to do that are a lot more time consuming 
yeah exactly 
which is one of the things i ran into architecture where 
i mean we only had you know one or two papers we had to write 
but there were one or two 
eight or nine page papers about a building that you had to go put 
hours worth of research into and then sketch and 
and it was just 
exactly yeah 
um 
actually 
i guess it's something that's always started 
sort of been there 
always been real big on just building things mean been 
real big hands on 
and 
last summer i helped my dad 
uh 
put a garage onto his house 
um 
like i mean literally i mean we poured the foundation and everything like build everything up from there 
and it turned out really well and i mean it was 
really fun to do i mean 
it's 
i liked it a lot better than being stuck 
inside all the time 
and 
just ya know sort of doing the same old same old everyday there it was always something different i have to be outside 
and it was just a lot 
easier to do 
um 
actually it's more 
it's almost actually turned into like a self business 
um 
like i said it started out with my dad and then people would ask me what i was doing i'd tell them 
they'd be like oh i have some things around the house that need to be done and 
so i'd go there and they'd tell people and 
i'd get more 
people asking me for that and i mean it turns out pretty nice i'm making 
about ten or eleven bucks an hour 
and i mean it's basically any time i have free i mean it's not like i have a set schedule of when i have to work things like that it's just 
whenever i feel like i have to do it 
i do it so 
um 
actually oddly enough that's what i'm putting in 
one of the bathrooms right now is a jacuzzi 
um that's 
not really too hard but the hardest 
thing to do is electrical work 
like it's just because it's more intimidating 
than it is 
difficult 
exactly getting 
getting electrocuted or something yeah 
that just doesn't appeal to me too much but i mean it's 
really not too difficult i mean as long as you're 
careful and 
think about things i mean it's pretty easy to do 
yeah we lived 
um 
we moved about 
five or six years ago 
um 
and the house we had before was some big like eighty ninety year old house 
and 
i mean obviously it needed a lot of repairs because it's pretty old and there were just things that he'd do and i guess just 
picking up watching him seeing what he would do that's 
where it took me to 
and it just sort of 
sparked an interest in me i guess and 
it just grew from there 
yeah 
yeah i've run into that a lot i think 
part of it was the high school i went to i mean i've gone to 
catholic schools all my life or whatever 
and 
obviously i've run into 
a lot more of the wealthier type people who 
either just don't have time or don't have the interest and just pay people to do it 
and as a result 
like there are 
kids my age and stuff like that that i've talked to i mean they have no idea what's going on 
which 
i mean isn't necessarily a bad thing but 
i mean it's something that's definitely noticeable in there 
oh did you 
uhhum 
oh yeah it's 
oh yeah 
yeah plus i mean you 
save a lot of money too i mean 
kind of i've seen a few of like infomercials on stuff like that 
um but i can't say anything too 
serious has come up from it 
um 
i mean i'd that's definitely a possibility for career wise down the road but 
um 
i don't know i will have to see 
takes me 
i went  
for grade school 
and  for high school 
um 
that is on  road 
like ninety nine east  road or something like that 
uh 
it  
wasn't anything too huge i think it had about twelve hundred people in it or so 
um 
it i mean it was 
pretty good place i mean looking 
back on it 
i remembered a lot better than when i was actually there 
obviously i mean it was just something that 
just i mean you don't really appreciate it until 
you've gone through it 
and then 
remember back on it 
yeah 
um 
i don't really think there's 
any huge difference 
um 
i can say from what i've seen 
the people that went to the catholic schools 
um 
they are a little bit more disciplined and know how to like organize their time better and things like that like i mean most of my friends have gone to the 
public schools are 
really overwhelmed by the amount of stuff that they have to do here 
um 
and i definitely i mean 
i've 
think i went to like kindergarten in the public school so i don't really know 
too much about like the kind of curriculums and things that they had to do 
but i know i mean as far as going to  
a lot of the stuff like in math and things like that 
that i'm doing now 
is stuff i already covered in high school so i already have a basis for it 
um so i think that 
part definitely helps whereas most of my other friends you know they're kind of lost they don't know 
exactly what they're doing 
um where like said i've 
already 
done all the stuff that we're doing now and know 
how to go about it and 
how to do it so i think that would probably be about the biggest differences just 
really the amount of 
education you get 

i would say for the most part that that 
not 
is not really true 
um 
i would  tend to say most people i know are 
at least fairly ethical i mean 
sinister group than the other that i know 
i mean obviously everyone has their dark side but i'd say  
in general people are 
pretty good people 
i mean 
there's nothing bad about them or anything that they 
oh yeah all the time 
yeah that part was no different i mean 
no 
um 
there were one or two 
um 
i guess that would be a slightly different part i'm  
not really sure how big of a problem that is in public schools but 
mean one being the girl that did get pregnant she ended up going to public school the next year 
um so i'm sure that 
increases the rate in public schools from 
the catholic schools 
expelling 
um 
what they do 
uh 
they have like up to four or five months 
the first four or five months pregnancy they're aloud to maintain 
once they start to show 
they don't let them go to the school anymore just for 
their 
uh health of the baby 
um 
so they 
sort of send them on their way or whatever 
and she did have the opportunity to come back 
uh   
she was through with her pregnancy but she did end up just going to a public school 
kind of yeah 
um 
this case i do know what happened to the father i think he ended up moving to colorado 
um 
no nothing at all 
it it was known that he was the father 
like i said i mean 
he 
he was kind of 
uh 
just 
kids 
and 
i mean he didn't listen to anyone or anything and 
he ended up 
like running away from home basically and like i said going out to colorado 
and like on his drive down there his car broke down and his parents like wired him money 
for him to get a plane ticket to come back and he ended up just taking the money fixing his car with it and  
kept on going 
so i mean he was just 
one of those people i guess i mean there was really no hope for 
um 
i probably would 
like i said just mainly more for the education standpoint of it 
um not necessarily the catholic beliefs 
or anything like that i mean 
that's 
something that 
i don't know i'd sort of 
make known to them 
but not something that i'd 
really push on them 
um sort of let them make their own decision when they got older what they wanted to do 
where they wanted to go with it 
um 
well as far as my mom goes she's 
real into the catholic faith and i mean she made me 
always go to church and things like that 
and i think that's probably why i feel the way i do now 
why i wouldn't push it on them 
cause that's almost made me be resentful towards being catholic just the fact that i had it forced on me 
for 
about seventeen or eighteen years 
and just reached the point where i'd 
had enough of it and i mean i didn't want 
anything about it 
and i mean that's not to say that 
i don't 
like being catholic or whatever 
it doesn't so much bother me it's just having it forced on me 
like i said just sort of gives me a different opinion of it 
and 
the real 
meaning behind it so 
nope 
she does know that i don't go to church 
um 
she 
doesn't so much mind anymore 
i mean since i've 
turned 
eighteen 
i mean ever since then it's been no 
problem or anything i mean she's sort of let me have my own opinion 
but i mean i honestly do think i'd at least go to church on occasion if 
it wasn't forced on me 
i mean it just got sort of  
just 
to the point of being 
seventeen eighteen years 
every single week 
of the year i mean 
it just got to the point where 
i'd had enough and 
i didn't wanna 
um 
both of them are older 
my  like twenty seven twenty eight and my brother's twenty four 
um 
they have started again recently 
uh they sort of hit the same point where 
they'd just had enough of it too and stopped 
um but 
recently they are 
getting into going to church 
um 
um neither one of them's married or has kids 
uh 
my  
does  boyfriend for um 
probably like three years or so 
and there is talk about them 
like marriage and kids and stuff like that with them 
um like they're living together things like that 
um 
as far as my brother goes 
say i 
see my brother too often 
um he does live in town 
um but 
usually he's 
either at work because he works fulltime then he has 
he's a part time student columbus state 
um 
so i don't really see him during the day and then 
at night he usually goes out does his thing i go out and do my thing 
so i mean as far as what's going on with him 
i really don't know but  i know i mean there's nothing 
real serious 
with him or anything like that 
um 
not really 
he 
i mean 
he 
obviously 
to church too 
for 
at least a few years 
um 
while they were 
my parents were still together 
but 
i mean since then i mean there's really 
nothing about him 
not really i mean 
she 
i don't 
my mom's kind of weird like that she 
she more believes in the religion aspects of it 
not so much as what the catholics believe about it 
um 
like their views on outside of religious matters 
um she just more   
with their 
views of god or what not 
as opposed to what the catholic church actually thinks is correct and 
what should be done 
yeah 
yeah 
um 
probably would've been about six years ago 
i'd been in 
sixth or seventh grade 
yeah i lived with my mom since then 
uh my dad is remarried 
um 
probably been married for 
four or five years 
she's pretty nice i mean 
she's 
definitely at least standable and 
acceptable so 
uhhum 
yeah 
um 
yes and no 
like i said i think the average person 
is pretty decent person i mean i don't think that 
there's 
anything violent or that 
anything wrong with them 
but at the same time 
it's just the media focuses on the one's that are out of control and makes a big deals of 
the ones that are out of control 
and i think that sort of what people pick up the perception to be i mean they don't 
they don't show about like when people are helping people out or things like that when the local high school's 
like volunteering at 
like the local senior citizens' home or something like that 
instead they pick up on oh so and so was arrested for drug dealing today he 
you know 
so and so age and 
they sort of give background on him and that's 
what everyone bases their view on 
it seems to be is that everyone turns to the media to see what's going on 
when the media's only showing one side of the story i mean there's definitely much more out there 
that's going on than they're 
telling you 
um 
so i really don't see a big 
problem with 
the way 
the 
america's going or whatever the youth 
um 
and like say i wouldn't say it's any 
than any past generations 
i mean 
other than like i mean obviously like guns and things like that are being around 
but 
simply the reason being was because in past generations they weren't around for it 
um i mean 
there were things out but there's nothing like what they have today you know the small little hand guns and things like that they're real easy 
carryable and concealable i mean 
like you know back in the sixties stuff like that i mean they had switchblades things 
yeah i mean 
i mean there's really nothing 
too different 
exactly 
yeah 
um 
i sort of agree with the fact that 
if someone wants a gun they will get a gun 
it doesn't matter what they do to 
try to make it 
so people can't get their hands on guns 
they're basically always gonna be around and people are always gonna get them if they want them 
i think more what they need to do 
is 
in strict 
or 
uh just make stiffer penalties to people that carry the guns or that are involved in shootings and things like that 
um 
because i mean for the most part 
i mean people really don't get 
too badly punished for things 
i mean if you look in other countries i mean 
like people 
like the 
asian countries places like that i mean they have really strict laws 
i mean if you even get caught for like vandalism you're still serving jail time and you get 
you get pretty badly punished for it 
i mean some cases they will even 
chain you up and beat you in public for it 
um 
i think 
not to sound too vengeful but i think if more things went that way 
that there'd be a much less problem with it 
um i think just the fact that the jails are so over crowded now that they know that they're gonna get good time and parole and all sorts of stuff 
that if you shoot someone you're 
you're not even gonna get thirty days in jail and 
you're gonna be 
let go i mean that's an awfully small price to pay for 
just carrying around a gun and shooting someone 
uhhum 
yeah 
yeah 
um 
i don't really know honestly i mean 
it's definitely careless nature and definitely something has to be done to them 
but at the same time it's not like they had the intent 
to do it 
so i can't say anything too incredibly severe 
um 
but i mean i almost think it should be 
considered basically 
child neglect things like that 
um 
basically the same penalties that you'd run into for that 
um 
but 
i mean 
they obviously do need to make it more severe because obviously your kids 
has the opportunity to kill themselves with a gun 
but 
i mean that's just 
sort of the curious nature of kids i mean they 
obviously they're gonna 
get into stuff and things like that and i mean it's not always the 
parent's fault i mean 
i  there are a lot of people i mean 
i think just in the news a few weeks ago they 
had a shooting that happened couple of years ago and they just came to a verdict on it 
and the parent like left in a  top drawer of a tool shed that was locked 
and the kid knew where the key was he climbed up on the ladder unlocked it and he ended up shooting himself with it 
i mean as far as that goes i mean there's really nothing more he could do i mean 
yeah i mean 
it's just out of your control and i mean like i said i mean that's 
sort of kids for you i mean they just 
obviously they're gonna be curious about things 
and 
the parent definitely does have to be held responsible for it 
but i don't know  to what degree 
that they should go with it 
nothing serious no 
um 
not really i mean 
i've been with a few people that have 
just 
i mean just 
randomly gotten kind of jumped i mean they didn't steal anything they just 
beat them up for no reason or what not 
but i mean it's was nothing too serious or violent i mean 
they didn't like pull out any weapon or 
anything like that it was just a fistfight yeah 
happened sometime 
um 
probably would've been my  
my freshman year in high school 
um we were just 
walking down 
high street and 
i guess we were 
wrong place at the wrong time and 
some people 
were like yelling stuff 
and we couldn't make out what they were saying 
and one of my friends was like what'd you say 
and he took that as like a threat or something like walked over 
and 
just 
picking a fight with him 
just 
to beat him up 
but 
um 
they probably would've been 
um about seniors in high school or so 
juniors or seniors in high school i mean it wasn't anything too 
serious it was just more 
i guess a testosterone trip or something 
oh 
definitely yeah like i said 
parts no different 
uh 
um 
it's probably would be worse 
i mean actually 
just wait for my last experiments i heard couple people talking about it they were talking about it 
yeah 
um 
and 
i can say 
there are some drugs that 
i don't really consider to be too threatening or 
that i'm really too worried about people using 
um 
like i mean just the whole idea with marijuana things like that i mean 
it doesn't really 
bother me so much i mean 
cigarettes and alcohol basically do the same thing it does 
and i mean those are legal 
obviously 
um 
obviously things like once you start getting into cocaine p c p things like that those are a little bit more serious 
and 
obviously a lot more dangerous and 
i definitely think that there is a bigger problem with 
the bigger drugs 
once you get it to like college or whatever 
as back into  into high school 
um 
i've been to parties and things like that where people were shooting up with like heroin and things like that 
um 
and 
i mean that's 
pretty 
i don't know extreme yeah 
um 
so i mean it's definitely i would say this more serious drugs are definitely 
much more widely used once you get into college 
um but i mean as far as like the pot and just things like that i mean i can't say i see any difference between 
here and high school 
ecstasy is the drug i've been hearing about 
a 
a lot the past 
like year or two and it's definitely something that's grown 
just like almost out of control 
um 
it's pretty 
dangerous drug i would say for the most part 
um not so much 
the getting high part of it but just what goes into it 
uh like i know one of the 
poisons used in it is like rat poison or something like that 
i mean just obviously the idea of putting rat poison into you when it's meant to kill a rat 
obviously seems pretty dangerous 
uhhum 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
um 
ecstasy yes 
there are a few people that i know that 
use it 
like on a fairly regular basis even 
um 
i mean nothing's happened to them and 
i mean like i said 
the high getting high part of it 
isn't so much of the problem it's just what goes into it 
um so i mean basically 
my opinion on that is just leave it up to them 
i mean if they wanna take the risks obviously they know 
the risks and what goes into it 
and like i said i mean it doesn't really hurt anyone the high part of it 

no i mean 
where they 
god and 
yeah one of  
uh 
friends cousins went 
that fraternity 
um 
don't remember what the cause was of his 
um 
but i mean like said i mean that definitely 
a dangerous drug to be using 
and 
i mean not 
that they should 
it or 
i mean obviously 
that's pretty extreme to do 
like i 
i mean it's something  to where 
should know the risks of it 
and know what goes 
it 
i mean it's sort of like if you saw  
laying on the street and you 
eat it or whatever 
i  
you don't know 
behind it or what's going into it why would you do something like 
um 
if you're going to do something like 
you better at least 
the 
involved 
it and  
exactly you're doing 
before you do 
like that 
not at all 
oh yeah 
i don't think anyone really 
affected anyone  
much 
as far as that goes 
yeah 
i don't know 
like i 
i mean it's something 
i  
see it almost as being the 
thing as like cigarettes or whatever 
i mean yeah it's bad for you there's a lot of 
in it things like 
far as 
what it 
the effects it does to you it's no worse 
alcohol can do 
you 
um 
so i  
i don't know i mean 
i'm not sure if 
actually go so far as to legalize it but i don't think it's  
that they need to really spend that 
to control drug   
coming in i mean i  
i think it's like 
or somewhere like 
where they've legalized  
and they basically do it government 
where 
government 
actually gives them out 
and the government gets the money for it 
um 
i can almost see that as  
almost a good idea  
i mean obviously like i said 
are gonna do it 
no matter what i mean the same thing 
if 
want it they will get their hands on it doesn't matter what they have to do 
it 
they will 
i mean actually i mean i could see that 
they  
at 
the money from and put it  
better  of some sorts if they did the 
not really no 
yeah 
it would a little bit 
but at 
i mean it was 
a long time ago i mean i don't know how  
how far in the 
you have to  
for 
be considered a problem of something coming up again 
um i mean as long as he's not 
didn't have any 
of being like an addicted   
like 
i mean i 
i can't 
it really bothers me 
much 
yeah 
um 
it would  
i'd probably base 
decision 
political 
um i can't 
i'd really hold that 
him or 
obviously 
not 
i'd be like oh good well 
vote for him 
did that 
but 
at 
time i don't 
i'd really hold it against him 
i mean 
it's something that 
happens   
things 
like 
by no means am i 
yay go president clinton or anything 
but 
i mean i can't 
i'd hold it 
him for doing something like 
i mean 
that threatened the 
or whatever 
i mean it's something he 
to deal 
has to deal with the problems with him 
up to him to resolve it 
i mean 
i 
along the   
like physical abuses things like that 
would  probably 
the  
um like if 
got 
there were  
uh excuse me 
he was allegedly beating his wife or 
like that 
then yeah  
that would cause a problem with 
i can't say that 
i would vote for anyone like 
i  just like small 
like 
it doesn't  
the 
or 
and i mean it's  
that  
i can't really see a problem 
it 
um but like i 
i mean  he's 
like 
picking fights things like 
i  
i can't say i'd support anyone like 
um 
i can't say that'd really bother me 
like i said i mean  something that's his choice his opinion what not 
i mean it's up to him it doesn't 
affect the 
like 
i mean he's still 
long he's making the right decisions or whatever 
yeah i mean i can't say that they 
be any difference with them 
they did  like cover 
like 
religion and 
classes things 
um 
i mean they didn't really do 
too extensive on it they 
as far as religion classes go they basically told what 
church believed about it 
how they felt about it but i 
they didn't    
support it or 
like 
i mean  
they 
did realize that it's  
up to the person i mean 
the most part yeah i mean 
like 
they 
out and said 
was  
it 
but at the same 
like with the research things like that  
they're saying that it could be a mental disorder of some 
i  
they couldn't 
much really condemn it 
to the point anymore 
that 
used 
um 
a few 
that they did  
specifically  
um homosexuality 
but 
i mean there were other 
that 
cover 
i mean 
not like it was 
an 
all out 
on being gay or 
i really did not no 
college wise i don't  
anyone of college 
age 
gay 
i do know a few  
that are  
um 
but  
in their thirties 
or so 
they  people i met through friends 
um 
one of my  parents 
had a friend that was  
um and 
just be over there whatever 
i mean i can't say 
big difference between 
gay people or 
straight people so 
uhhum 
yeah 
i would 
it doesn't 
either way honestly 
i  
of the matter is they  so deal 
it i  
get over it i mean 

obviously it's not something new that's 
been coming 
i mean it's obviously been around for a long time 
and 
i mean 
yeah if they find the cause of it whatever you know that's good but 
at the same time it 
the cause of it doesn't really matter 
i mean the fact of matter is it's there they have to deal with it so 
if they 
had a way to cure it then fine 
but 
leave that up to the people 
don't say oh well 
your son's gonna be gay he's two right now let's 
you know 
change this so it 
so it doesn't come out to be a problem or whatever 
but 
i mean i think they need to leave that to the decision of the people 
i mean obviously 
if 
like thirty and they're gay i don't 
see them as being too wanting to change their entire life basically at that point in time 
um 
honestly 
i can't say it really bothers me too much 
um 
i mean as far as 
just dealing with 
gay people or whatever 
it 
doesn't bother me at all 
it's just something 
i don't wanna 
deal with or whatnot 
um so i mean 
the fact that 
i mean two 
people of the same sex are living together married or whatnot 
that doesn't bother me 
like i said it's just more something that 
i don't know it does definitely make me uncomfortable out in public or something if i see like two guys holding hands or whatnot 
it's 
i think it's just more because it's so  
different than 
like what you 
things like that 
but at the same time i mean i don't 
dislike them or anything for it i mean 
it's their choice i mean 
fact of the matter is it doesn't have any 
effect or 
anything on my life so 
i don't know that's kind of a 
tricky question really 
because on one hand 
obviously the kid 
definitely 
get 
uh 
made fun of and teased and things like that 
during school 
but at the same time 
i mean as long as 
the 
love the kids it doesn't really matter what sex they are and they treat them well 
um 
so i mean that's kind of a tough question 
to answer i mean it's almost 
it's something that they almost need to ask the kids but obviously 
at the age that they'd be adopting um they 
obviously wouldn't know 
how to answer that question yeah 
um 
i can see where 
the people are coming from thinking that they might turn them into 
gay people or whatever 
um just because obviously 
you basically mimic your parents as far as 
what you do when you're young and 
things like that 
and obviously 
had two 
male parents or whatever 
obviously you might be thinking 
more towards 
like dating guys and things like that 
um 
i don't know if that'd be really a problem though i mean i don't know if that would 
honestly happen 
um 
i mean  of the matter is if being gay is 
a genetic disorder 
then that should have no effect 
on the kids because 
they should still be 
i 
normal i guess or  
you want to say 
um 
as far as 
being heterosexual 
so i mean i really can't say that i'd see that affecting the kid's 
sexuality at all 
uhhum 
that wouldn't bother me at all 
um 
i can't say that'd 
really bother me too much i mean it's 
thing as 
having 
a woman gym teacher or whatever 
um 
i mean fact of the matter is 
a lot of people out there 
i guess 
could be child molesters or whatever i mean it 
if they're straight or gay or 
whatever 
the fact of the matter is i mean they're 
they're out there 
and anyone you come across could be 
getting 
i don't know i guess 
weird ideas of your kids or whatever 
i was in the cub scouts 
so that was like 
through like sixth or seventh grade or something like that 
yeah 
um 
i don't think that really matters honestly 
um 
i mean by the time you get into the boy scouts you're usually 
eighth grade or something like that seventh eighth grade and up 
and i think by 
time 
most kids have at least a general idea of who they are 
and what they 
and don't like 
um i can't see 
i can't see them actually looking at like 
uh their 
leader or whatever as being too much of a role model figure anymore 
um i mean obviously it should be someone that they 
but i can't say that they'd be like oh well he does it so 
i'm gonna have to do it too or whatever 
um hum 
yeah 
uhhum 
really 
i  
didn't hear about that 
um 
i would agree that i  
regardless of your race you should be able to adopt 
a child i mean 
just  
you're a black kid living with like a white family doesn't mean 
you can't still have your heritage or whatever to be proud of 
i mean it's the same 
with like 
irish people adopting like italian babies or something like that i mean it's no different 
i mean 
as long as basically you know your roots and where you came from i mean i can't see it being a problem of any sorts 
um i mean just as long as they have someone that 
cares for the kid and 
does stuff for them i mean 
i can't see it being any 
um 
there weren't a lot but uh there were definitely 
some there at least i mean 
um 
eh about the same number 
uhhum 
yeah 

i think 
people are still fairly racist i don't think it's near as bad as it was 
but at the same time 
i mean i can't say i blame the white community so much for it 
i would say it's probably both 
the white and 
i guess 
any other race relation's fault 
um 
i mean as far as like if you look at the black communities things like that 
you have like b e t 
um 
you have like the united negro college fund things like that 
where 
they're almost segregating themselves by having these organizations 
because they're geared specifically towards black people 
and 
i think in a way that's almost segregating themselves from the rest of the community 
because they're not giving out equal opportunity to the people that need m 
um it's sort of like the same thing white people were doing 
you know thirty forty years ago 
where that they had they're 
white organizations or what not 
um and i think 
it's sort of going along the same lines where 
there is still a problem of it but 
i think it has gotten better at least 
if nothing else 
um 
i think 
i think for the most part people could handle it 
um 
obviously i think probably more 
the 
older generations would be the ones that would have the bigger problem with it the ones that grew up like during the whole 
black rights movements and things like that 
um i could see them having a problem with it but i mean more 
like 
more the generations of today or whatever 
like basically anyone under the age of about 
forty or fifty or so 
i think that they could probably deal with it i mean i don't think it caused any 
huge problems or anything like that 
uh yeah 
um 
yes 
and no they're kind of weird 
like 
that um 
one set of grandparents 
really i can't hear ever says anything 
there's a set on the other side that 
they are 
a little bit more racist 
um 
but at the same 
time 
it i 
don't know they almost set up like a double standard 
for black 
people 
there are black people that they really like and i mean they're actually friends with some black people and there are black people that they don't like for whatever the reason may be 
and 
those are the people that they're racist towards 
i mean it's the same thing that goes with 
white people obviously there are white you can stand they're white people that are just 
obnoxious and you don't wanna deal with 
um i mean it's basically the same 
thing 
right 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah 
yeah exactly 
um 
i really don't think we do for the most part 
i can't say i 
see any 
real big problems or anything like that 
that occur just 
because of 
the sex 
you are or anything 
i think that probably would've caused a bigger problem than the black 
president 
um honestly 
um 
although i don't really 
see too 
many sexist 
problems i definitely do see 
guys still be more 
like the decision making 
type 
and as being like the final 
say in things 
rather than women 
and i would see them 
having an authority figure 
that's being a woman 
as causing problems to m 
i think they would a bigger problem with it yeah 
um 
like i said it'd just be the old generations with the 
black president 
where now it'd be 
part of all generations that would still have a problem with it and i think that'd be a bigger number 
then 
would be with a black president 
and i think it would cause problems 
um i don't know if anything real violent or anything would occur from it 
but 
i definitely could see here 
definitely 
would think that people would be 
arguing about it yelling about it and 
making a bigger deal about it 
um 
probably for the most part i mean 
as long as they 
have a 
political background of some sort i can't say i see any 
real difference 
i mean for the most part they've proven to be able to do 
anything else any 
guy can do so 
uhhum 
no 
i 
not really 
i mean 
i don't think they'd come 
to any more difficult conclusions than guys had 
coming up to 
uh yeah 
no not 
at all 
no 
um honestly no 
i'm 
pretty shy for 
the most 
part so 
those 
more types of women i can't say 
i 
really 
ever had a relation with or whatever 
unfortunately although i don't like it 
yeah 
i don't know i just 
i'm a pretty indecisive person i don't like making decisions 
and she's kind of the same way 
so when it comes to what we're going to do or whatever it 
takes 
us hours to decide 
what we're going to do and i mean it just gets us 
nowhere 
i mean even some place 
as simple as you know where to go out to eat or whatever we will spend a good half hour forty 
five minutes just driving around till we actually 
decide a place or someone 
says something or 
whatever 
so 
what's that 
um i met her in high school 
she's still in high school and i'm in college 
so 
um 
yes and no 
i mean 
as far as 
the experience goes i mean i don't live on campus 
so i don't get the entire 
college experience you know 
the whole dorms and events going place on campus 
it's more things about pick and choose that i wanna do on campus i come down for 
um so i can't really say it's anything too drastic 
i mean obviously it's kind of weird when 
people are asking what you're doing and you're like oh i'm going to 
you know high school prom 
something 
i have parts a little 
little awkward but i mean i can't say it 
it's really any different or anything uhhum 
uhhum 
i 
honestly don't think that that really has much to do with it 
obviously it does 
put the idea in the kids' heads 
but 
it's been there for a long 
time 
um 
i mean obviously i mean that's how little boys are or whatever 
i mean obviously 
being 
uh being a little boy i remember 
i mean just 
seeing even things like football or whatever i mean 
it's you'd see something you thought it was neat so you'd do it or whatever 
i mean it goes back 
more towards the curious nature of 
kids 
where i mean i can't say there's anything really different 
whether 
they're play a video game where 
they're shooting people 
i can't say they 
see that as being something that affects them 
once they turn into adulthood and 
they feel like going out and shooting people or anything like that i don't think that 
has anything to do with it 
no i mean 
like said i think little kids are  gonna be little kids if that stuff wasn't on tv they're still gonna act the same way 
they're still gonna be 
walk around with toy guns things like that 
playing war or whatever 
um 
i think it's probably 
some of both 
i think it's probably more 
but 
i mean  
they are gonna have different views on how things work 
um 
but i mean for the most part 
i can't see that as 
being too big of a problem 
um 
obviously there are more like violent guys out there and things like that then there are women 
but at the same time 
i wouldn't say there's anything too 
over powerful as far's the 
the number of guys being out there 
are violent i mean it's something 
that 
unfortunately does happen but i mean  
more how you're brought up whether you can control it or not 
all right
