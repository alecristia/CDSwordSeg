two tall towers
wall in the hall
well here here's a wall right here
the wall is getting taller and taller
it's a tall wall
don't fall off tall walls
the tall wall falls very nicely
how do you make a bed with blocks
can you show me
you need to have four posts right
and then you need to have a mattress in the middle
you could make the mattress out of these skinny ones
that's right
line them up next to
you've got to realize that you are dealing with a symmetry freak
the mattress has to be very even or it won't pass inspection
yes that is a red one
and it is a red big one too
in fact it is the biggest red block there is
good show Brendon
you are going to be army engineer I can tell
uhhuh
where does it go
show me where it has to go
where it wants to go
wherever it might go
okay put it where it wants to go then
put it here
how many blocks Brendon
how many blocks
green blocks
hello how are you
doing well
honey
no
okay
yeah
no
maybe
right out in front
well Trish will be here if I'm not
she's at the Green star right now
oh
well she's working somewhere so track her down
so I'm watching the kids
and then and then when she comes home I'm going up to school
oh okay
oh well
so I'm expendable huh
let me just check the sides to be sure
okay hold on for just a second
no honey honey
okay
hi sweetheart
good
no we don't have a radio
we for the Gales
no
I don't know ask Andre
okay how's it going
Barb Barbara Salomon stopped by
she lives around the corner and does day care
and vaguely knows of the Tucker's
and she just left her name and number and suggested that
yes
real well
he brought over some of his own toys today
a couple of Leggo style trains and  a of blocks
battery operated
and there seems to be an awful lot less competition between them
I think we should recommend to Kathy that she always bring some
yeah
and just rotate them
because they are getting along really well
Brendon has nudged Joshua once in the last hour and a half and
that's possible too
he might not feel as much competition
because right now they are playing with blocks and crayons
that are not Joshua's and they are still doing fine together
okay we'll see you soon
love you very much
take care
byebye
that was mama Brendon
she's going to be home in an hour
Joshua look for another one just like it see
look here is another yellow wedge
see there is more than one of each kind of these blocks honey
and so if Joshua has one and you want it before you take it you
duplicate
what's the matter honey
want to share some of Joshua's toys now  that he is sharing
