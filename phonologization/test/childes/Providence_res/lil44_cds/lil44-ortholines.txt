looking for him
and there he was
hi she said I'm Isabelle
and I'm Vik he told her
Isabelle and Vik had lots of fun together
Isabelle told silly stories and Vik whistled like a bird
he knew how to cross his eyes too
I wish I could do that Isabelle said laughing
then Vik said let's go to Rhino city and you can meet all of my friends
in Rhino city everyone stared at Isabelle
they whispered to each other an elephant in Rhino city
how very strange
lady Rataxes was terribly angry
you cannot be friends with that little elephant she told her son
king Rataxes ordered Isabelle to leave at once
and don't come back
we don't like elephants in Rhino city he shouted
Isabelle walked back to Celeste Ville
she felt so sad
would she ever see her new friend again
Vik was unhappy too
the very next day he snuck out of Rhino city to look for Isabelle
Isabelle had the same idea and it was not long before they found each other

Vik showed Isabelle a boat
my father and I like to go fishing said Vik

soon they were in the middle of a lake
do we pass a lake when we go to the swim club
yeah
we go over the little bridge
and we see the lake
yeah
look there's an island Isabelle pointed
let's land there
Isabelle and Vik hurried ashore to go exploring
follow me Vik said
what kind of bird does that look like
it does look just like a flamingo
you are right
Isabelle and Vik played toss the coconut and hide and seek
what do you do when you play hide and seek
do you count to ten and say ready or not here I come
hmm hmm
suddenly a strong wind started to blow
the sky grew dark and it began to rain
Isabelle and Vik ran back to the boat
but it was gone
how will we ever get home cried Isabelle as they searched for the lost boat
don't worry Isabelle said Vik trying to sound brave
you are my friend and I won't let anything bad happen to you
we'll find the boat
oh look cried Vik there it is
Mister Mister Isabelle shouted that's our boat
I know you the hippo told Isabelle
you are Babar's little girl
I'm Murphy Heavy Bottom
oh I remember you Isabelle said
this is my friend Vik
nice to meet you Vik Murphy replied
hop aboard I'll tow you back to the mainland
the hippo took Isabelle and Vik back to his house
Missus Heavy Bottom was there to welcome them
you need to dry off she said and then we will call your parents so they will not worry
what's Murphy wearing
it looks like underpants
it might even be a bathing suit since he was swimming right
yeah
Missus Heavy Bottom gave them towels
Isabelle pretended hers was a long flowing gown
I am the queen she told Vik
and I must be King said Vik
soon the sun came out
Isabelle and Vik played with a telescope while they waited for their clothes to dry
I can see Celeste Ville from here said Vik
I think that's Isabelle's dress
it's drying
because it was so wet
right
yeah
oh I bet you are right
and what is Vik looking at
what's he holding
what's he looking into
you are right
ah looks like he's wearing his underpants
looks like Isabelle's wearing her underpants too
she must be a big girl if she's wearing underpants right
yes
that's Vik and he has a towel around his shoulders
that's Vik the little rhino
he's Isabelle's friend right
well she
Isabelle is an elephant and Vik is a little rhinoceros
right

an he's called a dragonfly
there was a water slide on the side of the house and Isabelle and Vik took turns
let's see who can make the biggest splash said Vik
me first Isabelle laughed and down she went
whoosh
then the hippo came to the window
come inside said Murphy it's time to go
I've tried to call your parents but there's no answer
I'll take you home myself
first we'll go to Rhino City and then we'll go to Celeste Ville he told the two friends and off they went
they had not gone far when Isabelle said wait I hear voices
it was Babar and Rataxes
Celeste and lady Rataxes were there too
everyone had been searching for the children and now they were arguing
what have you done with Vik shouted Rataxes
I bet he's with Babar's little girl said Lady Rataxes
Babar shook his head angrily
I have no idea where Vik is he said
I'm looking for Isabelle and I'm as worried as you are
the children ran to their parents
here we are they cried
thank you so much for bringing the children back safely Babar said to Murphy
but lady Rataxes was still angry
keep your daughter away from our son she said
let's get home now said Babar
and as they drove off towards Celeste Ville Isabelle waved
bless you
Isabelle waved to her friend
and Vik waved back
Isabelle couldn't stop thinking about her friend
do you think I'll ever see Vik again Isabelle asked her father that evening
I hope so said Babar
he's a nice little boy
sure enough the very next day there was a tap at the window

one morning Ariel the Little Mermaid went looking for hidden treasure with her best friend
Flounder
Ariel was supposed to sing for the first time in front of her father king Triton and all the other mer people
but for now she was much more interested in sunken ships than her father's concert
while they were searching Flounder began to get nervous
what was that he said
did you hear something
suddenly a very large
shark smashed through the side of the ship
swim a shark Flounder cried
they swam away very quickly
Ariel and Flounder found a safe spot where the shark couldn't reach them
you big bully Flounder shouted at the shark
as soon as she was sure they were a safe distance from the shark Ariel thanked Flounder for being so brave
even though he was a very small fish he had a very big heart and he was Ariel's best friend under the sea
after their adventure Ariel and Flounder headed home hoping that they would not be too late for her father's concert
ooh it's a big concert
what's the octopus playing
right
and what's Sebastian doing
what is he
he's the conductor and he's conducting the orchestra
and these fish are all playing horns
and what does she have on her head
feathers on her head wow

yeah she looks like she has sort of little feathers on her head too
and who is that

Cinderella
what's the story called
The Dance lesson
just imagine said Cinderella excitedly there's a ball at the palace tonight in honor of the prince and every maiden in the land is invited
that means me too
all of Cinderella's friends clapped and chirped as they gathered around
they loved their Cinderellee
oh dear said Cinderella with a sigh there's so much to do
I can only go if I've finished my chores and today Stepmother has given me more work than ever
there's washing mending ironing cooking scrubbing sweeping
suddenly three loud shrieks came from downstairs
Cinderella come down here immediately and help us get ready for the ball her stepsisters cried
her cruel stepmother and stepsisters wouldn't give poor Cinderella any time to do the rest of her chores
mend my dress screeched Anastasia
polish my shoes whined Rosella
iron my cloak demanded her stepmother
are they nice
no they are not so nice
but is Cinderella nice
she's nice
and are Cinderella's friends nice
yes
hours later Cinderella began to sweep and scrub the endless stone floor
suddenly Jack had an idea
I know he said
we'll help Cinderella
all the other mice nodded in agreement
what would I do without you she said patting each of them on the head
you are so good to me
everyone joined in the cleaning singing happily as they went
as she worked Cinderella began to imagine the magical evening ahead
everyone would be dressed in the finest clothes and Cinderella would wear her mother's beautiful gown
the ballroom would come alive with music dancing and laughter and the prince would bow before Cinderella and ask her to dance
suddenly Cinderella stopped dreaming
oh no she cried I've never been to a ball
I don't even know how to dance
dontchu worry Cinderella Jacques smiled reassuringly
we'll show you how to dance easy as pie
with that Jack bowed before Perla and extended his hand
dance please Missy he asked
Perla blushed as she took Jack's hand
Gus was the conductor and he got all the birds to sing
Jack and Perla spun round and around gliding across the floor
Cinderella watched and copied their movements
just listen and move see said Perla
not so scary
using her broom as an imaginary partner Cinderella danced and twirled gracefully through the room
she led everyone across the floor sweeping and cleaning as they went
good Cinderella said Jack beaming
lucky prince gets to dance with Cinderellee
the mice collapsed on the floor laughing
lets
oh there's Ariel
a Special surprise
the underwater kingdom was quiet and peaceful
every mermaid and merman was in bed fast asleep
everyone except princess Ariel and her friend Flounder
hurry up Flounder cried Ariel
it's almost time for the party
we can't be late
trying not to make sound Ariel and Flounder swam away from king Triton's palace
they began their journey toward the surface
but Ariel said Flounder are you sure we should go to the surface
remember last time
your father got so angry
you know how he feels about humans
that's right this time we can't get caught said Ariel
she wasn't to let anything ruin her plans for tonight
prince Eric the prince Ariel had saved in a shipwreck was having a royal ball
and Ariel had a very special surprise for him
swim faster Flounder she cried glancing back at him
and Flounder raced to catch up
just as Ariel and Flounder approached the surface Ariel saw beautiful lights dance across the water
I don't think anyone's wearing yellow there are they
no
what do you think's happening
well I guess prince Eric is out on the balcony
he just didn't feel like joining in the royal celebration
he could
Melody is crying
yeah
did Melody
when they had the party for Melody she didn't wanna be at the party either did she
she just wanted to go swimming right
yeah
she went back in the sea again
yeah
she was happy there right
did she go with Sebastian
yeah
Sebastian fell in the water again
yeah
prince Eric stood on the palace balcony
he couldn't stop thinking about the mysterious girl with the lovely voice who had saved his life
Flounder spotted the prince first
look Ariel he said pointing a fin at the castle
Ariel's heart leapt with joy when she saw Prince Eric
it's time for my surprise she said winking at Flounder
swimming up to a nearby rock Ariel and Flounder hid behind it
ready asked Flounder
with a nod Ariel closed her eyes opened her mouth and began to sing
suddenly the night was filled with the sweet sound of Ariel's voice
she sang a song she had written just for Eric
it was Ariel's special gift for him
hearing her beautiful voice again Eric's face lit up
it can't be he said
I must be hearing the sounds of the wind
still he remained on the balcony enchanted by the beautiful song
when the song was over Eric looked out across the sea
he hoped to catch a glimpse of the wonderful girl who had saved him
who are you he called out into the night
but all he heard was the echo of his own voice
I'll be back soon Ariel whispered as she and Flounder swam toward home

what's Corduroy looking for
I donno
tadah
tadah
tadah
oh my gosh what do you say
you are welcome
please
hmm
what's this book about
Corduroy
is Corduroy a little bear
what's he wearing
is he wearing overalls
yes
what color are they
oh
late one summer afternoon Lisa and her mother took their laundry to the laundromat
as always on such trips Lisa took along her toy bear Corduroy
a laundromat was a busy place at this hour
now Corduroy you sit right here and wait for me Lisa said
I'm going to help with our wash
Corduroy waited patiently then he suddenly perked up his ears
Lisa's mother was saying be sure to take everything out of your pockets Lisa dear
you don't want your precious things to get all wet and soapy
pockets said Corduroy to himself
I don't have a pocket
he slid off the chair
I must go find something to make a pocket out of he said and he began to look around
first he came to a pile of fancy towels and wash cloths but nothing was the right size or color
then he saw a huge stack of colorful clothes in a laundry basket
there ought to be something in there to make a pocket out of he said
without hesitating he climbed inside the bag which was filled with pieces of wet laundry
the dampness didn't bother Corduroy in the least
this must be a cave he said sighing happily
I've always wanted to live in a dark cool cave
when the time came for Lisa to fetch her bear he was gone
oh Mommy she said Corduroy isn't here where I left him
I'm sorry Honey said her mother but the Laundromat will be closing soon and we must be getting home
Lisa was reluctant to leave without Corduroy but her mother insisted
you can come back tomorrow she said
I'm sure he will still be here
as they left a young man wearing an artist's beret was taking his wet laundry out of a bag a very bad Corduroy had discovered
before he knew it Corduroy was being tossed together with all the sheets and shirts and shorts and slacks
into the dryer
but just as the artist was shutting the glass door Corduroy tumbled out onto the floor
how in thunder did that bear ever get mixed up with my things the artist wondered
poor Corduroy was damp all over
the least I can do for him is give his overalls a good drying said the man thoughtfully
he unbuttoned Corduroy's shoulder straps and put his overalls in the dryer
Corduroy grew dizzy as he watched the clothes spinning round but the artist became inspired
this would make a wonderful painting he said as he took out his sketch pad and began drawing the swirling colors
I can hardly wait to get back to my studio
finally the dryer stopped whirling and the man gathered up the clothes
and he helped Corduroy put on his warm dry overalls
all at once the manager of the laundromat called closing time everybody out
Corduroy was gently placed on top of a washing machine
I wonder who that bear belongs to said the artist as he was leaving
it seems to me he should have his name someplace
he's too fine a fellow to be lost
as soon as the lights were turned off Corduroy began searching
began his search again
he was surprised to see something white glowing in the dark
what is it
maybe it's snow he said
I've always wanted to play in the snow
he accidentally tipped over the open lidded box and suddenly he was covered in soft slippery soap flakes
it's soap
gradually Corduroy began to slip and slide
what fun he said with a smile
I've always wanted to ski down a steep mountainside
he landed paws first in an empty laundry basket
this must be a cage he said
I've never wanted to live inside a cage
but by now Corduroy was drowsy and soon he nodded off to
oh he's sleeping
next morning when the manager came to open the door of the laundromat Lisa was waiting
I left something here yesterday she said
may I look around
certainly said the manager
my customers are always leaving things
Lisa was searching under the chairs and in back of the washing machines when he
when he
when she heard the manager call her
is this whatchor looking for
yes he's my best friend shouted Lisa as she came running
she reached in and picked Corduroy out of the basket
so this is where you've been you little rascal she said
it's time I took you home
Lisa thanked the manager and ran out of the door down the street holding Corduroy tightly in her arms
why did you wander away she said
I went looking for a pocket said Corduroy
oh Corduroy why didn't you tell me you wanted a pocket asked Lisa giving him an affectionate squeeze
the very next morning Lisa sewed a pocket on Corduroy's overalls
and here's a card I've made with your name on it for you to keep tucked inside
that's his little pocket
I've always wanted a purple pocket with my name inside said Corduroy as he and Lisa nuzzled noses
that's some thread
that Lisa used to sew the pocket on
wow
that's great
well you want Mommy to pick it out
oh you wanna pick it out
okay
you have to carry your box
you want me to hold your milk
okay
what would be a good book to read
