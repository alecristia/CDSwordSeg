*MOT:	now , Corduroy , you sit right here and wait for me , Lisa said . 2493380_2498850
*MOT:	I'm going to help with our wash .
*MOT:	Corduroy waited patiently (.) then he suddenly perked up his ears . 2498850_2505855
*MOT:	Lisa's mother was saying , be sure to take everything out of your pockets , Lisa dear . 2505858_2510576
*MOT:	you don't want your precious things to get all wet and soapy . 2510576_2513641
*MOT:	pockets , said Corduroy to himself . 2513641_2520511
*MOT:	I don't have a pocket .
*MOT:	he slid off the chair . 2520511_2526945
*MOT:	I must go find something to make a pocket out of , he said , and he began to look around .
*MOT:	first he came to a pile of fancy towels and wash+cloths , but nothing was the right size or color . 2526945_2533445
*MOT:	then he saw a huge stack of colorful clothes in a laundry basket . 2533445_2537505
*MOT:	there ought_to be something in there to make a pocket out of , he said . 2537505_2540503
*MOT:	without hesitating , he climbed inside the bag , which was filled with pieces of wet laundry . 2540503_2546111
*MOT:	the dampness didn't bother Corduroy in the least . 2546111_2548690
*MOT:	this must be a ca:ve , he said , sighing happily . 2548690_2555236
*MOT:	I've always wanted to live in a dark , cool cave .
*MOT:	when the time came for Lisa to fetch her bear , he was gone ! 2555238_2559178
*MOT:	oh Mommy , she said , Corduroy isn't here where I left him ! 2559178_2562478
*MOT:	I'm sorry , Honey , said her mother , but the Laundromat will be closing soon and we must be getting home . 2562478_2567575
*MOT:	Lisa was reluctant to leave without Corduroy , but her mother insisted . 2567575_2572606
*MOT:	you can come back tomorrow , she said . 2572606_2576146
*MOT:	I'm sure he will still be here .
*MOT:	as they left , a young man wearing an artist's beret was taking his wet laundry out of a bag (.) a very bad [?] Corduroy had discovered . 2576145_2584721
*MOT:	before he knew it , Corduroy was being tossed together with all the sheets and shirts and shorts and slacks +... 2584723_2593481
*MOT:	into the dryer .
*MOT:	but just as the artist was shutting the glass door , Corduroy tumbled out onto the floor . 2593483_2597905
*MOT:	how in thunder did that bear ever get mixed up with my things , the artist wondered . 2597905_2602110
*MOT:	poor Corduroy was damp all over . 2602110_2605671
*MOT:	the least I can do for him is give his overalls a good drying , said the man thoughtfully . 2605671_2610478
*MOT:	he unbuttoned Corduroy's shoulder straps and put his overalls in the dryer . 2610478_2614441
*MOT:	Corduroy grew dizzy as he watched the clothes spinning round , but the artist became inspired . 2614441_2621206
*MOT:	this would make a wonderful painting , he said as he took out his sketch pad and began drawing the swirling colors . 2621206_2627441
*MOT:	I can hardly wait to get back to my studio . 2627441_2630056
*MOT:	finally , the dryer stopped whirling and the man gathered up the clothes . 2630056_2634140
*MOT:	and he helped Corduroy put on his warm , dry overalls . 2634140_2637515
*MOT:	all at once , the manager of the laundromat called , closing time , everybody out . 2637515_2642110
*MOT:	Corduroy was gently placed on top of a washing machine . 2642110_2646728
*MOT:	I wonder who that bear belongs to , said the artist as he was leaving . 2646728_2650306

*MOT:	what is it ?
*MOT:	maybe it's snow , he said . 2667013_2670456
*MOT:	I've always wanted to play in the snow .
*MOT:	he accidentally tipped over the open lidded box and suddenly he was covered in soft , slippery soap flakes . 2670458_2678258
*MOT:	it's soap ! 2678258_2679853
*MOT:	gradually , Corduroy began to slip and slide . 2679853_2683058
*MOT:	what fun , he said with a smile ! 2683058_2687511
*MOT:	I've always wanted to ski down a steep mountainside .
*MOT:	he landed paws first in an empty laundry basket . 2687511_2691950
*MOT:	this must be a cage , he said . 2691950_2694598
*MOT:	I've never wanted to live inside a cage . 2694598_2697908
