sometimes he poured orange juice on her
corn flakes
he liked to tie knots in the sleeves of her pretty dresses
he bored poured blue paint in her yellow paint jar and yellow paint in her blue paint jar
do you know what those colors make together if you mix yellow and blue together

that's a hard one I don't know
but every night at the dinner table p j smashed mashed carrots on poor Honey Bunny's head
look at Honey Bunny
after that he put her favorite fuzzy bunny blanket in the freezer
what happens when you put something in the freezer
yeah it gets cold and hard too
at bedtime he hid under her bed and yelled

then one night
when Honey Bunny was fast asleep p j painted her face bright green
Mom cried Honey Bunny in the morning look what p j did
Mr Funny Bunny was very angry

you were a very bad bunny Mrs Funny Bunny said
after that things were very different at the Funny Bunny house
Honey Bunny had her corn flakes with

he's gone out to play with his friends said Mrs Funny Bunny
Honey Bunny sat down by the window
she did not want to paint
she did not want to play dolls
she did not even want to play with her friends
she sat and sat and waited for p j to come home
finally p j came up the walk
hi p j said Honey Bunny

but Honey Bunny did not care
yeah her ears are big too
well they are bunnies bunnies have big ears
Honey Bunny looked under her bed

Mrs Funny Bunny looked at Honey Bunny then she smiled
what should she say

Honey Bunny could not believe her eyes
her face was painted blue with
yellow polka dots
