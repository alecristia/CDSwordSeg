it is a potty
it's a little potty
just it's a little bit smaller than your potty
now you have two potties

very nice
does that fit
I was thinking maybe we could use this potty in the car
sometimes

we can you know what little later you can help me put them all in a bag
there's something else in here for you too
why don't you put those back

Mommy's gonna take out all the laundry that needs to be hung up

yeah she's resting next to Frank
are you scared of something right now
what are you scared of
you are scared of nursies is that so
you just want me to carry you huh
I'd like you to help me hang up the socks
I saw that you hung up the sock very nicely already
the black and white sock
you are very good at hanging the socks up
I think you did it very carefully
you wanna hang up the other sock
that one's the matching sock actually
yes
you are doing a very nice job
there's lots more socks there
oh this one fell down a little bit that's okay
here I think
you can probably figure out which ones are matching
this one this shirt I need to
yeah
that's a matching sock isn't it
and that orange one matches
can you reach it
you can what
it was in the bath tub yeah
you'll find another set of socks
another pair of socks
mhm
can I show you something
if you pull it way down
oops Mommy made that one fall
then they
then they won't fall as easily
see
I was wrong
that did fall down
what yellow things
oh those are little
looks like they used to be little plastic butter flies
that are glued to the bath tub so that
no so that a person taking a shower won't slip
it's okay they are just plastic
yes honey
are you scared
just give me a nice big hug
why are you scared
of the plastic
plastic is nothing to be scared of honey bunny
you won't have to pinch me I'll carry you
it's plastic
it won't hurt you
do you hear that
good
the camera is making noise but I also heard the church bell
I think it stopped already
that's the camera
let's hurry up and hang those things up so that we can go to the play ground
we need to hang them up first
you a little scared
do you wanna go in the living room while I finish hanging this up
yeah
you are with me
alright I'll hold you
where's your microphone
by the way
okay
I will hold you and hang up my laundry
but I would like you to know that there's nothing to be scared of with that piece of plastic
I'm not doing anything to it
it doesn't matter
nothing needs to be done with it
nothing at all
yeah plastic butterflies
that's what they are for
but you know what we don't even use this bath tub
we don't even take showers in it
do we
we just use it to hang clothes
right
you wanna touch the
plastic butterfly
wanna touch it
want Mommy to touch it
okay
Mommy will touch it
yeah I'm rubbing it
it's flat
it's almost like a piece of paper
here actually you know what it peels right off
this is it
the plastic
we could throw them in the garbage
see it's plastic
should I see if I can get the other one off
you are standing on me
let's see if I can get peel the other one off too
we don't really need to have them in here
careful boo
this one is harder to get off
do you want to
next to the toilet
you know that garbage and you lift up the lid and put the butterfly in the garbage
yeah
yeah we took it off and we
put it in the and you Naima put it in the garbage
well I tried to peel that one off I had a little trouble
because it's kinda stuck
I'm not gonna do it right now right now what I want to do is finish hanging up the laundry
you are
you smell very nice
you were but then you touched it and you put it in the garbage
you are not scared of that anymore I don't think so
yeah you know what I think that might be paint from something that you painted that was drying there
I think that's what that is
here's another sock you could hang up
this is no actually
because this is gray and that's black
you are gonna need to look here
try to find a gray sock that matches
I don't know if it
it might not even be here
let's see where's the matching one
lalie lalie nursie
you can hang that up even though we don't have the matching one right now
why don't you go and hang that up
can I show you something
okay watch me do it
I'm putting it over but then I'm gonna pull the other side
because that way it won't fall down easily
yeah that's another plastic butterfly
there's another sock
who's sock is that
that's a Daddy sock yeah
remember what I said about pulling it
here I'll get it for you
try again try again
try hanging it up again
no use your other hand
that's okay
okay put it up there
yes and then what you should do is hold onto it and then bring this down so that it hangs like that
see that way it'll stay up it won't fall down that way
I'm showing you how to hang up the sock
there's another sock
try using both hands to make it stay
like I showed you
where's your other hand
where's your other hand
nope have this hand
give me this hand
give me your hand
okay
now go behind it and find the other end
and pull it like that
see that way it hangs
where's the
where's the sock that matches
whoa
are you okay
it looks like a funny little house doesn't it
mhm be careful there please
yes
oh my goodness the camera is minding it's own business
hello
it is dark when you close it
be careful please I don't want you to knock that over
you think so
what is it
huh
we need to put some socks on you and some sneakers
and I hope it's not raining because if it's raining then we can't go to the play ground
what
you want the umbrella to go in the rain
well but yes except that we can't go the play ground and play
with an umbrella
because an umbrella would simply get in the way of playing
I think it would
oh yeah
it is
let's check and see if it's running okay
that's the first thing we should do
that's alright we are going out of the yellow bath room
and there's nothing to be scared of
there's nothing to be scared of

okay
oh yeah it's not green briar
I don't know what it is but it's not green briar
it doesn't even have any thorns
I don't
oh maybe it does have thorns
but it's not green briar
green briar doesn't have weeds
it's okay it's not green briar
oh everything's okay
Mommy thinks that you are scared
other thorns some plants have thorns
it's good to know which plants have thorns so you can stay away from them
but I don't think that's actually green briar
that's the thing that my microphone attaches to
that attaches to my microphone
I guess I'd call it a microphone clip
I think it's a microphone clip
everything's okay do you wanna play in the living room
okay
do you wanna get
yeah that plant
I'm gonna look at that and see if I can figure out what kind of plant that is
you know what that might
hmm
what is that
it might even be a rose
or it might be a blackberry
actually I think it's
it might be a blackberry plant or it might be a rose
rose bushes have thorns you know
they do
and roses are very nice flowers
you really need me to carry you
I'll carry you if you want me to
I wanna look at that plant

and maybe we can go shopping after you are tired of playing
well the thing about going to the play ground is it looks like it's gonna rain
that means we really should go soon
if we are going to the play ground
because if it starts raining we can't go to the play ground
that's why I wanted you to go to the play ground now
because otherwise we might not be able to go at all
it might start raining soon
it's not raining right now but it might start raining soon
do you wanna try going to the play ground
well it's not raining right now
I'm with you
we won't go to the play ground if it starts raining
I would like to go to the play ground now but you told me you wanted to play here at home
you are gonna pretend the koala's going out in the rain
what are you doing
so that it doesn't drag on the floor

that might be a little big for Koala Mala
you think
it might not be too big
well we'll see I guess
Kate is watching the Mommy Koala put on her rain coat
Naima's rain coat actually
let's see if we can get her to fit in this properly
she's gotta wear a rain coat you want her to play outside in the rain

it's raining on the floor
what is she doing
oh she's playing on the side
with the slide

Koala Mala has her baby there but the baby doesn't have a rain coat
maybe we should make a rain coat for Koala baby koala Baby Kate Koala
what do you think
should we make her a rain coat

we could make her a rain poncho
do you know what a rain poncho is
a rain poncho is a little bit like a jacket it also protects you from the rain
