city over here
lots of tall buildings it looks like
city
is it New York City
yeah
can you find your bedroom window
a bathroom window that's different
that's important too
we have a window in our bathroom
should we
mm fits in doesn't it
but he can't dump it the way Dumpy can dump the sand
that's a good idea
where's the construction zone
let's
let's pretend they are building a city over here
and this
they are building all kinds of buildings
most of the buildings don't have roofs yet
they need some roofs
so the trucks are working hard
to put the roofs on the buildings
where's that that one
the bigger one there we go
we might need some sand too
because they are going to build a play ground
hmm
where's
where are we gonna build the sandbox
you know where I think a good place to build a sandbox is right over here because it looks like a park
there are lots of trees
so we'll clear some of these things out of the way
Harold's gonna help
how is he gonna get through the tunnel
we need to attach him  I have a way to attach him
I think there's a seat belt over here
I saw a seat belt in this box over here huh
let's see is there a seatbelt in here
yeah
I'm just looking for a seatbelt
to attach Bob to his scooper
hmm
crayons
what you doing honey bunny boo
well we could try a string that isn't as good
wanna try to attach him
want this
you had Bob now we need scoop
mixed up
there you can mix them up even more
oh
okay
you gonna try to take that part off
there you go
doesn't the red
does the red front go with the red back
or  there's the red front
no it's front to front
which way does the car go
this way this way this way this way this way this way
this way this way this way this way
mhm
I don't know
it's like playing tug of war again
mhm
oops  I'm tangle tangle up here
how about this
a digger
that's the right way isn't it
that's the backhoe
I was trying to mix it up
wanna mix it up with a fire truck
uhhuh
it's a fire digger
a fire digger
what else do you wanna mix it with
you wanna mix it with a police car
the front
uhhuh
that's still a fire digger huh
or a digger engine
mm okay
mm okay
that's right yeah
oh you are gonna really mix it up this time
we could even mix it up with the trains too
that's still a dumptruck isn't it
but it could be a dump mix truck
a mix dump
let's try the potty
yeah it's still a dumptruck
it just has a different cab up front huh
uhhuh
yeah but the cabs look almost the same except for the color of the circle huh
mhm
that's right and one circle is
is there another circle
does this one have a circle yeah
that's right
I don't know if that comes off honey
I could take this off
that's nothing now
but when you put that on
it's a signal it's a crossing gate right
is that what it's called
crossing gate
there you go big sigh
a digger
that's really a backhoe
because a backhoe has two
oh no you are right it's just a digger
then when you put this on together with it it's a backhoe
I think
a backhoe has two shovels
one in the front and one in the back
mm let's see
that's just a digger
let's try the potty
oops
attach it
see this one has little special places to attach it
this one doesn't
we can try and attach it but I don't think it
oops
I don't think it will stay very well
yeah let's see if we can get this back on
there it snaps on perfectly
mm we have some beads it could scoop up
we have
we could pretend they are stones
let's try the potty first and then I'll get you your beads
