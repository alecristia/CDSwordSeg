yeah it was good except they made you wait forever
my back is broken
like I hadn't been to a concert like that in so long it made me feel so old
because it was like wait in line
for like two hours because Jessica
well Jessica wanted to go early because she thought they would let you in early
at because it the thing said it starts at eight so she was like oh
well maybe we could get in at like seven or you know
so we get there at like quarter of seven and we wait in line until like seven no until like eight fifteen
and then they let us in
and then at like nine o'clock or ten after nine
then the opening act comes who was  yeah who sucked

but then she came and of course she's she made up for it because she was really good
yeah she was she did a lot of poetry it was good but  the crowd it was just a it was a weird crowd
as it always is but it's it's it's I don't grungy  you know
