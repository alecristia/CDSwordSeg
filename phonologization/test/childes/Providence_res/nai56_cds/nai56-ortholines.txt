he couldn't smell or hear anything that day because
cause the windows were shut I think
ooh what was it that was moving
a fat rabbit
was he chasing the rabbit
sometimes dogs like to do that
oh his collar fell off
oh that's what happened to his collar
I always wondered about that
his collar is what has something on it that says
where he lives
zoom went the rabbit through the zinnias
was he a zigzagging rabbit
he is
zoom went the rabbit through the zinnias
zinnia begins with letter Z
did you know that
that's the letter that it starts with
is he jumping up to try to get the
oh he's chasing the rabbit's legs
I think the rabbit has a hole in the ground that it's diving into
so he
he's using
Mcduff is using a lot of energy to try to
follow and chase that rabbit
yep
that's exactly right
it says Mcduff was so tired from chasing the rabbit that he laid down in someone's vegetable garden and fell asleep
what kind of a vegetable is he sleeping under
an eggplant

see the little camera
what a good book
which other book

we didn't buy that one
you know why we didn't buy that one
cause you put it back
you put it back at the store
we did get
we did get another book at the store but that
we didn't get that one
cause you were very upset at the store
you wanted to put the books back remember
well why did you want to put them back

this one is called Dinosaurs Beware
nkay called Dinosaurs Beware
look at all these dinosaurs
what are they doing
it is
what's that dinosaur doing
and look he has roller skates on
but he has three cause he has one on each foot and then there's one attached to his tail
one two three
yeah
and he's
got some headphones on
I think that means that he's listening to music
ooh
I think this is a book where lots of things are going to happen
huh
at home don't play with matches
whoa
he's throwing the matches over here and he's lighting his presents on fire
keep toys off the stairs
why do you think it's good to keep toys off the stairs
he tripped over some toys that were on the stairs and now he's falling
never play with electric sockets and plugs
they can shock you
see
it's hurting him
he put his tail into that and it's making him hurt
keep a list of important phone numbers handy in case of an emergency
what's happening in the kitchen
what do you see
what's going on
what do you think it is
what's a blue liquid
what kind of liquid is blue
yes
yes
in the kitchen
do you know what his floaty says
it says floatosaurus@wp
I think something was wrong with pipes and there's too much water in the kitchen
what's the cat doing
it is sitting on top of the freezer
I think a pipe broke and probably
the
a lots of the pipe and the kitchen is flooded
this is called a flood
when
when water
yeah
well he's not paying attention to what he's doing
he's lighting the candles on his birthday cake
and he throws them off on the side
he doesn't realize that he's putting all his presents on fire
that's not good
that's dangerous
what's this dinosaur doing now
what is that
is that a phone
it is
it's a phone on the wall
like that phone
there's a phone on that wall
floating in a floaty and dialing for help
probly dialing
y'know what
I bet she's dialing the fire department
cause if there's a flood
the fire department is one place you could call to help you get rid of the flood
this is a flood when water goes where it's not supposed to go and there's a lot of it
that's called a flood
that's just what it's called
look the milk is floating
there's the dinosaur's tail
looks like she was cooking some peas
cause the pan of peas is floating in the flood
let's see what else we have here
a hot stove or heater can burn you
don't touch either one
don't bang on glass doors or windows
oh look she banged on it and it broke
don't tell strangers who phone that you are home alone
just say hello and ask them to leave a message
well you are not gonna be home alone Sweetie
you don't even have to worry about that
dino phone
never play with things stored under sinks or in medicine cabinets
they can make you very sick
oh
never play with things under sinks or in medicine cabinets
cause they are not toys and they are not to be eaten at all
they make you really sick
they make you throw up
cause
they are bad for you
it's not for toddlers
or dinosaurs
it's just a rule that's why
it's just a rule because it's a rule
oh she's getting burned
she's touching the stove
if an adult isn't home don't let strangers into the house
tell them to come back later
mm
always put tools back where they belong
oh yeah if you trip on tools
sometimes tools are sharp
it can really hurt
I don't know
don't climb on thin branches
thin branches can break
cause they are thin
during a thunderstorm stay out of water and away from trees
lightning often strikes in both places
she's in her kiddie pool
to get cool
to have fun
she's got a shovel and a bucket too
and a boat
is that a bathing suit
do dinosaurs need bathing suits
mhm
what's the question
why does she have a shovel and a bucket
I bet she is
yeah
that's a good question
maybe that
Spinosaurus
during meals chew well before swallowing
look at this
he swallowed the fish without chewing it
and now his neck is shaped like a fish
see that picture
that's not good
you need to chew a lot when
before you swallow your food
don't lean too
don't lean back too far in your chair
she leaned back and
oh a big mess is happening
pay attention when using a sharp knife
well
that dinosaur was talking to another dinosaur
while he was using a knife to slice this orange
but he kept talking and he didn't realize he sliced the toaster in half also
oh no
by accident
cause he wasn't paying attention
cause he was looking at someone else and talking to someone else
if you have a knife in your hand you can't do that
you have to look at the knife and be very careful with what you are doing
don't gulp hot foods
taste them slowly
you know about that
that dinosaur's mouth is hurting because he ate something that was too hot
I don't mean hot and spicy I mean hot temperaturewise
I don't know
this green soup
was too hot
this looks like a good book
well
I think right now I'm gonna do some more cleaning up in the kitchen
you could
you could read it
or you
you wanna have your bears do a craft
are you hungry
okay
you wanna give them some things to glue
