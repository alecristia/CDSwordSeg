I've heard about this book
if you give a pig a pancake
that pig is climbing in the kitchen door
about to eat a pancake
she wants some syrup to go with it
I think that means maple syrup right
you'll give her some of your favorite maple syrup
she'll probably get all sticky
oh look at that little pig
she's all sticky
that's like when when you drink Motrin or Tylenol and it spills and it gets very sticky
it's so she wants to take a bath
ah because she's all sticky
she'll ask you for some bubbles
that pig wants to have a bath with bubbles
when you give her the bubbles she'll probably ask you for a toy
you'll have to find your rubber duck
that girl is finding the rubber duck to give it to the pig who's taking a bath with bubbles in the bath tub
the duck will remind her of the farm where she was born she might feel homesick and want to visit her family she want you to come too she look through your closet for a suitcase
then she'll look under your bed when she's under the bed she'll find your old tap shoes
she'll try them on she'll probably need something special to wear them with that pig is making a mess
that pig is really making a mess
when she's all dressed she'll ask for some music
you'll play your very best piano piece and she'll starts dancing
then she wants you to take her picture
otherwise known as a picture
look at that dancing pig
so you'll have to get your camera
and she sees the picture she'll ask you to take more she wants to send one to each of her friends she wants all those photographs
you have to give her some envelopes and stamps
on the way and take her to the mail box
oh they are going with a wheelbarrow full of mail to the mailbox
on the way she'll see a tree in your back yard she'll want to build a tree house ah
a tree house is a house up in the trees
so you'll have to
get her some woods a hammer and nails
there's a hammer and nails and there's lots of wood here
when the tree house is finished
she want to decorate it look the pig built a tree house
she'll ask for a wall paper and glue
when she hangs the wall paper she'll get all sticky
feeling sticky will remind her of your favorite maple syrup she'll probably ask for some
and chances are if she ask you for some syrup she'll want a pancake to go with it
