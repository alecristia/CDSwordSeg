oh I'll have to take off my sock won't I
just a moment
let's see here alright
here I'll take my I'll take my
with my ear fine
because of the medicine you gave me
okay can you examine my toe
I stubbed the little baby toe on the book rack
are you putting toe cream on my toe
oh good thank you what are you going to do to make it better
ah thank you
should I give my toe toe cream every day
can you get that over my heel there
oh thank you
I'll do the rest of it
okay thank you very much doctor Lisa
I will go home now
I have an idea
we could make an animal hospital and Pushpa could be the the veterinarian instead of the farmer
and she could take care of the farm animals that the farmer brings into the veterinary hospital
yes
Veena has to walk with the animals is there a vehicle that
whoop
oh okay
it's not a farmer
okay
oh hmm let's see hmm let's examine this young calf here
is it this boo this ear or this ear
both boo boos on both ears let me see
hmm hmm hmm everything's going to be alright little calf
hmm okay I'm going to give you a prescription and I want you to put this ear cream on the calf
go get that at the pharmacy is there something wrong with your adult cow as well
oh you have a microphone injury
oh this big cow has a microphone injury hmm
where is it exactly
on the tip of the cow's ear alright
let me just examine this with my special cow otoscope
hmm yes there's a different prescription that cow needs a different kind of medicine
from the pharmacy here you go
okay
yeah
thank you for coming
I think you should call me tomorrow and let me know if the ears have gotten better after you put the ear cream on
okay
Veena put them on both
that's good
you know usually it's the farmer who brings the cows to the veterinary hospital
yeah because cows don't actually
well cows cows usually really need a human to to drive them places
I guess that's the main reason
oh they were walking yeah
oh it's close by that's why you told me
that's good
I think they are all in the chicken coop that you made
oh dear is there a chick emergency
oh what's the problem with this young
that's good yeah
well hello little chick what seems to be the trouble
oh you have a foot on the oh injury on the bottom of your foot there
let me examine this
this chick's foot here oh yes okay
let me bandage up that up a little
and I suggest that you wrap this chick in a warm blanket
for at least a couple of hours
well you'll have to find something smaller like a cloth napkin
and wrap the chicken in the cloth piece of cloth
just for a few hours to help while its while its foot is bandaged and it needs to rest
it needs to stay warm while it's injured
and then at one o'clock you can take the bandaid the blanket off
well you don't need to tape it on all I'm saying is you need to keep the chick chick warm and dry
and stop it from running around for the next few hours
well I I would suggest you try to keep it keep it nice and quiet and maybe read it a book or something
the chick doesn't like long stories I see well maybe you could read it some poetry
thank you for coming why don't you call me tomorrow and let me know if the chick's foot has gotten better or not
oh
Pushpa's over here checking the camera
oh good
I'm glad to hear that
those these cows need to go back home
bring those cows home to get better
oh dear a fox
was this fox hit by a car accidentally
hmm hmm
think that I will put some nose cream on this fox and just let it go it's a wild animal
I'm gonna let it go it should get better by itself
the nose cream
mm
let see
well it's a wild animal and I expected that that might happen
wild animals don't take directions very well
alright well that's all you are going to get
even the little bit that was on you for short while should've helped you
oh someone ate the chicken and spit it out
okay this chick needs to be in a little tiny tiny blanket is there anything we can get how about one of those blue socks on the floor over there
let's wrap the chick up in that sock
here's the chick
okay that should keep the chick nice and safe and warm for a while
yes
yes
who's saying help
