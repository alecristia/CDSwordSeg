one two three four five is that how it goes
right
let me see
you know what
but I think that's a Gobot
I think its a Gobot that looks like a motorcycle
maybe its an autobot
maybe its a motorcycle
we could make a ramp for him to jump over
do you want to do that
maybe we could do that let's see
okay if we did it how could we do it we could do it I know how
you gotta make something okay
okay we will
wait this has got to go this way
take it easy there
yup
there it is
do you want it higher
we could make a higher ramp
there we go
that's a good ramp
just like evil Knievel
have you ever heard of evil Knievel
we broke the ramp
yeah
evil Knievel I'll tell about evil Knievel
you don't care about evil Knievel okay
yeah
it goes up
and then it comes down
which way
that's cause its an autobot
it's not an autobot
is it are you sure
an autobot motorcycle bring it over here
I sure do
he can go real high in the sky
how about this guy does he get to jump over the ramp
why not
why not
this is a ramp jumper
what if he jumps this high
can he jump backwards
huh huh
but he's not a race motorcycle
why
can he be a motorcycle now
okay he says
he wants you to race him
it cried soon and crashed into mine
oh okay here he comes
and jump down when he come down
okay here he comes he's jumping on the ramp and he jumps down when
I think so but we can play if you want to
your pretty good at catching fish
do I get em to cook
