god is perfect and right and good
he is the king of a perfect kingdom
nothing bad or wrong can live there
sometimes we do bad or wrong things

that makes us perfect right and good
now we can be in god's perfect kingdom
Jesus is like the door to get there

I already love you and you love me

you'll always be with me even at nighttime
I love your pretty stars but I don't like the dark
thanks for being with me at night
Jesus I can talk to you anytime anywhere
all day long
and all night long I know you care
thanks for staying awake so you can hear my prayers
Jesus do you ever feel sad
or mad
when I feel sad or mad
I know you are still my friend
I like having a friend like you
be careful
be gentle with the book
gentle
some days nobody can come over to play with me
when I feel lonely I know you are still with me
I like feeling your love
I'm so glad you are my special friend up in heaven
someday I'll bring my friends and we can have a peanut butter and
thank you Jesus for being my special friend
