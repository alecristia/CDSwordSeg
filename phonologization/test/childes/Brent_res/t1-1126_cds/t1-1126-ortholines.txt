and the only reason for being a bee that I know of is making
and then he got up and said
and the only reason for making honey is so I can so
so he began to climb the tree
he climbed and he climbed and he climbed and as he
he sang a little song to himself
it went like this
isn't it funny how a bear likes honey
buzz buzz buzz
I wonder why he does
then he climbed a little further
and a little further and then just a little further
by that time he had thought of another song
it's very funny thought that if bears were bees
they'd build their nests at the bottom of trees
and that being so
if the bees were bears
you shouldn't have to climb up all these stairs
he was getting rather tired
by this time
so that is why he sang a complaining song
he went nearly there now

he was nearly there now and if he just stood on that branch
