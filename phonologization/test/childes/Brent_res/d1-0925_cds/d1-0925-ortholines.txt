is your mama home
with you so happy
way down yonder where the dolphins play
where you dive and splash all day
waves roll in
and the waves roll out
see the water squirting out of your spout
baby Balooga
oh baby Balooga
sing your little song
sing for all your friends
we like to hear you
when it's dark you are home and fed
curled up snug in your water bed
the moon is shining and the stars are out
good night little whale good night
this page
baby Balooga
oh baby Balooga
with tomorrow's sun
another day's begun
you'll soon be waking
baby Balooga in the deep blue sea
swim so wild and you swim so free
heaven above
and the sea below
and just a little white whale on the go
you are just a little white whale on the go

Little nut brown hare who was going to bed
held on tight to Big nut brown hare's very long ears
he wanted to be sure that Big nut brown hare was listening
“guess how much I love you” he said
“oh I don't think I could guess that” said Big nut brown hare
Mandy look
“this much”
look at Mommy
look
“this much”
stretching out his arms as wide as they could go
Big nut brown hare had even longer arms
“but I love you this much” he said
“ that is a lot” thought Little nut brown hare
“I love you as high as I can reach”
look Mandy
“high as I can reach”
said Little nut brown hare
“and I love you as high as I can reach”
said Big nut brown hair
“that is very high” thought Little nut brown hare
“I wish I had arms like that”
then Little nut brown hare had a good idea
he tumbled upside down and reached up the tree trunk with his feet
“I love you all the way up to my toes” he said
“and I love you all the way up to your toes”
said Big nut brown hare
swinging him up
over his head
whee
whee
“I love you as high as I can hop”
laughed Little nut brown hare
bouncing up and down
up and down
up and down
“but I love you as high as I can hop” smiled Big nut brown hare
and he hopped so high
that his ears touched the branches above
“that's good hopping” thought Little nut brown hare
“I wish I could hop like that”
“I love you all the way down the river”
“and all the way down the lane as far as the river”
cried Little nut brown hare
“I love you across the river and over the hills”
said Big nut brown hare
“that is very far”
thought Little nut brown hare
he was almost too sleepy to think any more
then he looked beyond the thornbushes out into the big dark night
nothing could be farther than the sky
“I love you right up to the moon” he said
and closed his eyes
“oh that's far” thought Little nut brown hare
“that is very very far”
Big nut brown hare settled Little nut brown hare into his bed
he leaned over and kissed him good night
give him a kiss
then he layed down close by and whispered with a smile
“I love you right up to the moon”
“and back”
