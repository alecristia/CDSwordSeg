with his knees huh
but I like to eat cake in a tub laughed the cat

uhoh
he looks pretty unhappy
what's their mommy gonna say
and then I got mad
this was no time for fun
I said cat you get out
there is work to be done
I have no time for tricks
I must go back and dig
I can't have you in here eating cake like a pig
you get out of this house
we don't want you about
then I shut off the water and let it run out
what do you think of that
oh no
oh
the water ran out
and then I saw the ring
a ring in the tub and oh boy what a thing
a big long pink cat ring
it looked like pink ink
I said will this ever come off
I don't think
oh does he look embarrassed
do you think he's sorry
why is he sorry
and then what
but why would this why is he sad to see the ring
the drips coming down from his hat
why do you think
yeah
yeah
yeah he's got water on his hat
and it's dripping off
have no fear of that laughed the cat in the hat
why I can take cat rings off the tub just like that
do you know how he did it
with mother's white dress
now the tub was all clean but her dress was a mess
now what are we gonna do
oh dear
then Sally looked in
what's she what does she have in her hand
what do you do with a shovel
dig
dig
dig for what
snow
and sand
rocks
what about dirt
in the garden
when daddy plants does he dig with a shovel
Sally saw the dress too
and Sally and I did not know what to do
we should work in the snow
but that dress
what a spot
it may never come off Sally said
it may not
but the cat laughed
ho ho
I can make the spot go
the way I take spots off a dress is just so
see here laughed the cat
it is not hard at all
the thing that takes spots off a dress is a wall
then we saw the cat wipe the spot off the dress
but the dress was all clean now the dress was all clean
what why was he putting these spots all over the wall
huh
but why
they make a mess
okay
oh wall spots he laughed
to take spots off a wall all I need is two shoes
whose shoes did he use
I looked and saw whose
and I said to the cat this is very bad news
now the spot is all over dad's ten dollar shoes
but your dad will not know about that said the cat
he will never find out laughed the cat in the Hht
his ten dollar shoes will have no spots at all
I will rub them right off on this rug in the hall
but now we have rug spots I yelled
what a day
rug spots
what next
can you take them away
don't ask me he laughed
you know that I can
then he picked up the rug and away the cat ran
how's he gonna clean the spots off the rug
all the numbers
the numbers of what
uhhuh
okay
he ran into dad's bed room and then the cat said it is good
then he shook the rug
crack
now the bed had a spot
and all I could say was now what cat
now what
but the cat just stood still
he just looked at the bed
this not the right kind of a bed the cat said
to take spots off this bed will be hard said the cat
I can't do it alone said the cat in the hat
it is good I have someone to help me right here
right here in my hat on the top of my head
it is good that I have him here with me today
he helps a lot
this is little cat a@l
and then little cat a@l took the hat off his head
it is good that I have someone to help me he said
who's that
yeah
such little cats
how does he keep them in this in his head
they are not they don't walk do they
do they just stand there
oh
so why are they in there
okay
these little cats are in his hat
and then b@l said I think we need little cat c@l
that spot is too much for the a@l cat and me
but now have no fear
we will clean it away
the three of us little cats b@l c@l and a@l
come on
take it away yelled little cat a@l
I will hit that old spot with this broom
can you see
it comes off the old bed and it goes on the tv
and then little cat b@l cleaned off the tv
he cleaned it up with milk
put the spot in a pan
and then c@l blew it out of the house with a fan
but look where it went I said
look where it went
you blew the mess out of the house
that is true
but now you made snow spots
you can't let them stay
well let's think about that said the cats b@l c@l
with some help we can do it said little cat c@l
then pop on his head we saw little cat d@l
then pop pop pop pop we saw cats e@l f@l and g@l
we'll clean up that snow if it takes us all day
if it takes us all night we'll clean it away said little
now how are they doing this Shem
but why does that make it go away
but this did not look very clever to me
kill snow spots with pop guns
that just could not be
all this does is make more spots we yelled at the cat
your cats are no good
put them back in your hat
take your little cats g@l f@l e@l d@l c@l b@l a@l
put them back in your hat and you take them away
oh no said the cat
all they need is more help
help is all they need
oh no
now he has all these little teeny teeny cats
so what are they gonna do
they are so little
little cats h@l i@l j@l k@l l@l and m@l
but our work is so hard we must have more than them
we need little cat n@l
we nood@wp o@l
we need p@l
ho boy
so all these little cats
there they are
killing the spots
kill the mess yelled the cats
and they jumped at the snow with long rakes and red bats
they put it in pails
they made high pink hills pink snow men pink snowballs
oh no
look
there is that spot all over the yard
everything is pink
what are they gonna do
but how can they clean it up
there's so much of it now
who's that little boy

this is wind
this is like air going hwhuhh
see
okay
look close
in my hand I have little cat V
on his cat hand are cats w@l x@l y@l and z@l
z@l is too small to see so don't try
you cannot
but Z is the cat that will clean up that spot
now here's z@l
you can't see said the cat
but I guess you can't guess what he has in his cat hat
he has something called voom@wp
voom@wp is so hard to get
you never saw anything like it I bet
why voom@wp cleans up anything clean as can be
then he yelled take your hat off now little cat c@l
take the voom@wp off your head
make it clean up the snow
hurry you little cat
one two three go
then the voom@wp it went boom and oh boy what a
now don't ask me what voom@wp is
I never will know
but boy let me tell you it does clean up snow
there they are
so you see laughed the cat
now the snow is all white
now your work is all done
now your house is alright
and you know where my little cats are said the cat
where are they
are they inside his hat
Shem you seem so tired
do you want maybe are you tired
no
yeah
well there's nothing on television really now
well maybe we should play with play dough or something
do you think
yeah we could make snow ball men
but how can we make snow ball men if there's no snow outside
oh yeah
we could do that
well why don't we play with play dough
some what
shapes of play dough
okay
let's do that
where's some play dough
oh
the cat in the hat
mkay
the cat in the hat
yup
there's two of them on the front page
and there's two more on the back page
going away
what's going away
the two cat in the hats
yeah because we turned the page
the sun did not shine
it was too wet to play
so we sat in the house all that cold cold wet day
see
there's that little bird
because this time it's so wet out
it's raining so hard that he's all wet
huh
yeah it's raining
right
hit his head and he couldn't get up in the morning
let's sing it again
it's raining
it's pouring
the old man is snoring
cracked his bed and cracked his head and couldn't get up
in the morning
oh that's an ear ring
it's just supposed to have that hole in it
yeah
do the people at Little kids Place wear ear rings
the hole
there
see it's not really a hole
it's just part of the ear ring where there's nothing there
a hole
in my ear
no there's no hole in my ear
see
well because I didn't want to have any holes in my ear
this just goes on like this
see
do you want to put it on
your finger
here
you can see how it works
on your ear
there
okay
I sat there with Sally
we sat there we two
and I said how I wish we had something to do
too wet to go out and too cold to play ball
