# 2.2 DIBS requires a bit of corpus to calculate some statistics. We'll use 200 lines from the version with the word boundaries to this end (we remove syllable boundaries, which are not needed):

head -200 ${input}/tags.txt | sed 's/;esyll//g' > ${RESFOLDER}/clean_train.txt

# 2.3 Remove word and syllable boundaries to create the test file that will be segmented:

sed 's/;esyll//g' ${input}/tags.txt | sed 's/;eword//g' | sed 's/  / /g' > ${RESFOLDER}/clean_test.txt

cd /fhgfs/bootphon/scratch/lfibla/CDSwordSeg/algoComp/algos/DiBS/
# 2.4 Actual algo running;runing the DiBS algorithm (phrasal), training on the development set and testing (with no further learning) on the test set. Includes an output diphone matrices:

python apply-dibs.py ${RESFOLDER}/clean_train.txt ${RESFOLDER}/clean_test.txt ${RESFOLDER}/dirty_output.txt ${RESFOLDER}/diphones.txt

# 2.5 The final command post-processes the output file as needed. In particular, it replaces the training word boundary symbol (";eword") with the desired output word boundary symbol (";aword"), and puts a copy of the word boundary symbol at the end of the line (since I assume your evaluation metrics need it there):

sed 's/[^\t]*\t//' < ${RESFOLDER}/dirty_output.txt | sed 's/$/ ;aword/' | sed 's/;eword/;aword/g' > ${RESFOLDER}/clean_output.txt
